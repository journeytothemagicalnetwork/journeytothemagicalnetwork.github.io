He could usually be found at the [[Clock Tower Courtyard]]. Unlike most people who thought that [[Horace Slughorn]] was a stakeholder, Trevor thought that he was a good teacher. One day he was duelling and beat him. The blow was so powerful that he needed two days recovering in the hospital wing. He was also an admirer of the author [[Gilderoy Lockhart]].<ref name=\"HBPG\">{{HBP|G}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\"Trevor\" is from a surname which was originally from a place name meaning \"big village\" from Welsh ''tref'' \"village\" and ''mawr'' \"large\".\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{1st}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Duelling Club}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Birch, Trevor}}\n[[es:Trevor Birch]]\n[[pl:Trevor Birch]]\n[[fr:Trevor Birch]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Duelling Club members]]\n[[Category:Gilderoy Lockhart's fans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
