He played as a [[Beater]] on the [[Hufflepuff Quidditch team]] when it was captained by [[Cedric Diggory]].<ref name=\"QWC\">{{QWC}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Anthony\" is the English form of the Roman family name Antonius, which is of unknown Etruscan origin. The most notable member of the Roman family was the general Marcus Antonius (called Mark Antony in English), who for a period in the 1st century BC ruled the Roman Empire jointly with Augustus. When their relationship turned sour, he and his mistress Cleopatra were attacked and forced to commit suicide, as related in Shakespeare's tragedy ''Antony and Cleopatra'' (1606).\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{QWC}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rickett, Anthony}}\n[[de:Anthony Rickett]]\n[[es:Anthony Rickett]]\n[[it:Anthony Rickett]]\n[[no:Anthony Rickett]]\n[[pl:Anthony Rickett]]\n[[ru:\u042d\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0420\u0438\u043a\u0435\u0442\u0442]]\n[[Category:Beaters]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Hufflepuffs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
