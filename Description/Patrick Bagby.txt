This name was adopted in the 5th-century by Saint Patrick, whose birth name was Sucat. He was a Romanized Briton who was captured and enslaved in his youth by Irish raiders. After six years of servitude he escaped home, but he eventually became a bishop and went back to Ireland as a missionary. He is traditionally credited with Christianizing the island, and is regarded as Ireland's patron saint.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{1st}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[pl:Patrick Bagby]]\n[[fr:Patrick Bagby]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bagby, Patrick}}\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Hufflepuffs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
