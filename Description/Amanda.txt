However, it was not used during the Middle Ages. In the 17th century it was recreated by authors and poets who based it directly on Latin amanda \"lovable, worthy of love\". Notably, it was used by the playwright Colley Cibber for a character in his play 'Love's Last Shift' (1696). It came into regular use during the 19th century.<ref>http://www.behindthename.com/name/amanda</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Amanda}}\n*{{PS|F}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[de2:Amanda]]\n[[es:Amanda]]\n[[fr:Amanda]]\n[[pl:Amanda]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws Sorted in 1991]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
