On the first day of term, [[2 September]] [[1992]], she seemed to have been let in on rumours that [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] behaved in a [[snake]]-like manner even in the way that he ate.<ref name=\"PSgba\"/>\n\nAfter the [[first year|first-years']] first [[Potions (class)|Potions]] class, she hung about the [[Dungeons]] talking with fellow [[Slytherin]]s about the upcoming [[Flying (class)|Flying]] lesson. She made fun of the [[Hufflepuff]]s by saying \"''Don't walk under a flying Hufflepuff. They plummet''\". She did not complete Snape's assignment of gathering all the ingredients for the [[Wiggenweld Potion]] (only [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] managed to procure [[Wiggentree bark]]) \u2014 at one point, she asked around \"''Can you tell what [[dittany]] is by the smell?''\".<ref name=\"PSgba\"/>\n\n{{Quote|I need a Remembrall like Neville's.
