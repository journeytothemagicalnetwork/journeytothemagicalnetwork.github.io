Her clothing seems to indicate that she lived during the sixteenth or seventeenth century.\n*Elizabeth Burke's portrait bears a resemblance to a [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Elizabeth_Talbot%2C_Countess_of_Shrewsbury_from_NPG.jpg 1592 portrait of Bess of Hardwick, Countess of Shrewsbury] by [[Wikipedia:Rowland Lockey|Rowland Lockey]].\n*It is possible she may be related to [[Caractacus Burke]], co-founder of [[Borgin and Burkes]].\n*The start screen for {{HPK}} is the only time Burke's portrait is seen in the Headmaster's Office.\n\n==Etymology==\n*\"Elizabeth\" is from ''\u0395\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b5\u03c4'' (''Elisabet''), the Greek form of the Hebrew name \u05d0\u05b1\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05d1\u05b7\u05e2 (''Elisheva'') meaning \"my [[God]] is an oath\" or perhaps \"my God is abundance\". It has been very popular in England since the reign of Queen [[Elizabeth I]] in the 16th century. Famous modern bearers include the British queen [[Elizabeth II]] (1926-).\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{PS|F}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{COS|F}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{POA|F}} {{Portrait}}<ref>DVD 2 - Special Features (''The Quest of Sir Cadogan'')</ref>\n*{{POA|G}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{OOTP|G}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{DH|G1}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{HPK}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{WWHP}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{HM}} {{Portrait}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogwarts below ground floor}}\n{{Hogwarts first floor}}\n{{Hogwarts seventh floor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burke, Elizabeth}}\n[[es:Elizabeth Burke]]\n[[fr:Elizabeth Beurk]]\n[[pl:Elizabeth Burke]]\n[[ru:\u042d\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0442 \u0411\u044d\u0440\u043a]]\n[[et:Elizabeth Burke]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Brown-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Burke family]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Historical figures]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts Headmasters and Headmistresses]]\n[[Category:Portraits]]\n[[Category:Pure-blood supremacists]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
