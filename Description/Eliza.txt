She began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1985\u20131986 school year]], where she was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw]]. \n\nEliza was revising for her [[Potions (class)|Potions]] exam late one night in the [[Ravenclaw Common Room]], and the next day she could not find her notes. She thought another pupil might have used the [[Severing Charm]] on her bag, which made them fall out. Eliza then searched the common room for the notes, which she eventually found.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*The search for Eliza's notes was a specific assignment for Ravenclaw only players in {{HM}}. In the game, [[Rowan Khanna]] tells [[Jacob's sibling]] why Eliza needs their help and they agree to search the room with her. Eliza was very grateful for their help and went to tell [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] about their kindness towards [[first year]] Ravenclaws.<ref>{{HM|2|Take Note}} {{c|info revealed to [[Ravenclaw]] players}}</ref>\n==Appearances==\n*{{HM}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}[[ru:\u042d\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430]]\n[[Category:1970s births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1985]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
