As revealed in ''[[Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies]]'', Chapter 3 (Horace Slughorn), Slughorn had \"completed half a century of service\" at the time of his retirement in [[1981]], meaning he started teaching there circa [[1931]]. Dorea, born in [[1920]], presumably attended Hogwarts from [[1931]] to [[1938]] or [[1932]] to [[1939]], and thus would have been a student of Slughorn.</ref>\n|loyalty = *[[House of Black]]\n*[[Bulstrode family]]\n*[[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]\n**[[Slytherin]]\n*[[Potter family]]\n}}\n'''Dorea Potter''' (n\u00e9e '''Black''') ([[1920]] \u2013 [[1977]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], the youngest child of [[Cygnus Black II]] and [[Violetta Bulstrode]] and sister of [[Pollux Black]], [[Cassiopeia Black]], and [[Marius Black]]. She attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] where she was sorted into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]].  \n\n==Biography==\nDorea attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] where she was sorted into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]] from c. 1931-1938.  \n\nSometime after Hogwarts, she married [[Charlus Potter]] and they together had [[Charlus Potter's son|one son]]. Dorea was the paternal aunt of Alphard, Cygnus, and [[Walburga Black]], thus she is the great-aunt of [[Sirius Black|Sirius Black III]] and [[Regulus Black]] II, as well as [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], [[Andromeda Tonks]], and [[Narcissa Malfoy]].<ref name=\"BFT\">''[[House of Black|Black Family tree]]''</ref> As well as this, Dorea is the great-great aunt of [[Draco Malfoy]] and [[Nymphadora Tonks]] and the great-great-great aunt of [[Scorpius Malfoy]] and [[Edward Lupin|Ted Lupin]]. Also, she is possibly related to [[James Potter I|James Potter]] and his son, [[Harry Potter]].  \n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Dorea'' may come from the names ''[[Wikipedia:Dora|Dora]]'' (\"gift\") or ''[[Wikipedia:Dorothy (given name)|Dorothy]]'', which mean \"to see a gift\" in Greek (as opposed to \"Theodora\" which means \"a gift from god\" in Greek), or from [[Wikipedia:Dory|dory]], a type of small boat. The name \"Dora\" appears before Dorea: her great-aunt was named [[Elladora Black|Elladora]] and her cousin was named [[Callidora Black|Callidora]].\n\n''Dorea ''can come from Irish ''Doireann'', which means \"sullen\" or \"daughter of Fionn\". ''Fionn'' means \"fair, white.\" \"Sullen\" and \"fair, white\" can relate to many of the Black family's traits.\n\nBlack can be considered a colour, and is the result of the absence of, or complete absorption of, light. In Western culture, the colour black has typically been associated with evil, darkness, and witchcraft, but also with prestige and sophistication \u2014 appropriate for the House of Black. Black has also been associated with life and prosperity by other cultures. In ancient China, black was the symbol of the element of water, which also corresponds to Slytherin, the Hogwarts house of almost all members of the Black family. In English heraldry, black represents darkness and ignorance; a possible allusion to the prejudice common to members of the House of Black.\n\nHowever, the English word ''black'' is derived from either the Old English ''bl\u0153c'', meaning \"black\", or ''blac'', meaning \"pale\".Pallor is associated with sickness and the colour white, which is usually held to symbolise purity in Western and Indian culture, and death in East Asian cultures. This mirrors the typical colouring of members of the House of Black \u2014 dark hair and pale skin.\n\nDorea's married surname is Potter. Potter is a very common surname of English origin. It traditionally refers to the occupation of making pottery. Beatrix Potter was a well-known English children's author. Potter's Field is the name for a burial ground for the unknown or unclaimed dead, particularly soldiers and orphans; it is first mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew. The Potter family had many members that fit that description. The Potter Box is a model for making ethical decisions developed at Harvard University. J. K. Rowling has also commented that she has liked this name since childhood, due to a relationship with two friends who were named Ian and Vikki Potter.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*There was some speculation that Dorea Potter was the mother of [[James Potter I|James Potter]] and so the paternal grandmother of [[Harry Potter]]. However, the actual names of James's parents were revealed to be [[Fleamont Potter|Fleamont]] and [[Euphemia Potter]], via {{PM}}.<ref name=\"PotterFamilyPottermore\">{{WW|the-potter-family}}</ref> In spite of this, it is still more than likely that Dorea was possibly an aunt or a cousin by marriage of James.\n*Dorea was not Featured on the Potter family tree on Pottermore. She does, however, appear on the Black Family tree that was released.\n*Her first cousin [[Cedrella Black]] married the \"blood traitor\" [[Septimus Weasley]] and was disowned, but Dorea Black married [[Charlus Potter]] but was not disowned thus implying that the Potter family was a \"respectable\" pure-blood family. Many families who various members of the House of Black married into would now be seen as blood-traitors such as the [[Longbottom family|Longbottoms]], the [[Macmillan family|Macmillans]] and the [[Prewett family|Prewetts]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{OOTP|F}} {{Comment|Appears on Black family tapestry}}\n*{{OOTP|G}} {{Comment|Seen on [[House of Black|Black family]] tree tapestry}}\n*{{DH|G1}} {{Comment|Seen on [[House of Black|Black family]] tree tapestry}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Black, Dorea}}\n\n[[de:Dorea Black]]\n[[es:Dorea Black]]\n[[fi:Dorea Musta]]\n[[fr:Dorea Black]]\n[[pl:Dorea Potter]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u043e\u0440\u0435\u044f \u041f\u043e\u0442\u0442\u0435\u0440]]\n\n[[Category:1920 births]]\n[[Category:1977 deaths]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts students during the Riddle-era]]\n[[Category:House of Black]]\n[[Category:Married individuals]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Potter family]]\n[[Category:Pure-bloods]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1930s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
