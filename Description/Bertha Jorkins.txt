She was at Hogwarts when I was, a few years above [[James Potter I|your dad]] and me. And she was an idiot. Very nosy, but no brains, none at all. It's not a good combination, [[Harry Potter|Harry]]. I'd say she'd be very easy to lure into a trap.|[[Sirius Black]] regarding Bertha's lack of intelligence|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\n'''Bertha Jorkins''' (born c. [[1953]]-[[1958]]; died [[1994]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] employee who worked in the [[Department of Magical Games and Sports]] before her [[death]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nBertha Jorkins was born at some point between [[1 September]], [[1953]], and [[31 August]], [[1958]]. Her parentage is unknown.\n\n===Hogwarts years===\nBertha Jorkins was a few years ahead of [[James Potter I|James Potter]], [[Sirius Black]], [[Remus Lupin]], and [[Peter Pettigrew]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. She was a gossipy girl and not very bright, which Sirius noted to not be a very good combination.<ref name=\"GOF19\">{{GOF|B|19}}</ref> During her school years she would regularly complain about mistreatment from other students and spread rumours, even once ending up in front of [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] following an incident. Bertha was described as being a slightly plump girl with a sulky expression, though her expression could just be due to the fact she was complaining to Dumbledore. She once complained about being [[Hex]]ed by a [[Florence's boyfriend|boy]] whom she teased because she had caught him kissing [[Florence]] behind the [[Hogwarts greenhouses]].<ref name=\"GOF30\">{{GOF|B|30}}</ref>\n\n===Career at the Ministry===\nAfter graduating from Hogwarts, Bertha joined the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and floated between Departments, including [[Department of International Magical Co-operation]] while [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Barty Crouch Snr]] was the Department Head. She finally ended up in the [[Department of Magical Games and Sports]] under the leadership of [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]].\n\nBertha had the misfortune of making a visit to the estate of Crouch Snr with some papers for him to sign, where she discovered the Crouch family secret that they were keeping their convicted [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] son [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] trapped in their house under the [[Imperius Curse]] and an [[invisibility cloak]] when their [[house-elf]] [[Winky]] was talking to the criminal, of which Bertha heard enough to deduce who was under the cloak. When Bertha confronted Crouch Snr, he had to place a powerful Memory Charm on her to alter her memory and make her forget what she had found out. However, the Memory Charm was so powerful, in fact, that she suffered permanent brain damage, leading to the extreme forgetfulness she had since been known for.<ref name=\"GOF35\">{{GOF|B|35}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nBertha Jorkins went on holiday to [[Albania]] in [[1994]]. One night in a wayside inn, she ran into [[Peter Pettigrew]], who the Ministry thought to be dead at the hands of [[Sirius Black]]. Although she recognised him, he was able to persuade her to take a stroll with him into the woods, and he was able to overpower Bertha and bring her before his master, [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], who was hiding in Albania. Lord Voldemort was able to break through the memory charm placed by Crouch Snr on her through [[Cruciatus Curse|torture]] and learned of the imprisonment of his follower Crouch Jnr, and also learned valuable information about the [[Triwizard Tournament]] which he would use to try to kill [[Harry Potter]].<ref name=\"GOF1\">{{GOF|B|1}}</ref>\n\nBreaking through the memory charm had left Bertha severely \"damaged,\" by permanently damaging her mind and body beyond repair, and Lord Voldemort murdered her with the [[Killing Curse]], because he had no more use for her. Voldemort used her death to turn his [[snake]] [[Nagini]] into a [[Horcrux]]. Pettigrew noted this was a poor move, believing that the Ministry would notice her disappearance and that they could have simply modified her memory to cover their tracks, which Voldemort believed would be an insult to her ''memory''.<ref name=\"GOF1\"/>\n\n===Postmortem===\nAs a result of her demise, Bertha did not return when she was supposed to. Her reputation of being forgetful and not very bright made many believe she had lost track of time and was perhaps just lost, so the truth was not discovered for a while.<ref name=\"GOF5\">{{GOF|B|5}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|Don\u2019t let go, now! Don\u2019t let him get you, Harry \u2014 don\u2019t let go!|Bertha's echo to Harry Potter in the Little Hangleton graveyard|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\n[[File:Priori Incantatem Pottermore.png|250px|thumb|left|Bertha Jorkins (far right) emerges from [[Tom Riddle's wand|Voldemort's wand]] during the [[duel in Little Hangleton]]]]\n\nDuring the [[Duel in Little Hangleton|duel]] between [[Harry Potter]] and Lord Voldemort in the [[Little Hangleton graveyard]], when the spells of the two [[Duelling|duellists]] clashed into a [[Reverse Spell|Priori Incantatem]], Bertha was one of the echoes to emerge from the bond. She supported Harry while withholding Voldemort. Harry would later report Bertha's fate and temporary return to Dumbledore and Sirius, thus solving the mystery of her disappearance.<ref name=\"GOF34\">{{GOF|B|34}}</ref>\n\nThree years later, Bertha was ultimately avenged when Harry defeated Voldemort during [[Voldemort's Last Stand|the latter's last stand]].<ref name=\"DH36\">{{DH|B|36}}</ref>\n\n==Physical Appearance==\nBertha was a slightly plump woman.<ref name=\"GOF30\"/>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nBertha was a very gossipy and nosy woman, though she was not very bright, which in [[Sirius Black]]'s opinion, not a very good combination.<ref name=\"GOF19\"/> She was displeased with the mistreatment she received from her schoolmates despite her nosiness being the cause of their motive.<ref name=\"GOF30\"/> Even in adulthood, her intelligence did not improve much, as upon discovering Barty Crouch Jnr still alive and hidden from the world, she confronted Crouch Snr instead of leaving to report to the Ministry, thus letting to her being struck with a Memory Charm. This ultimately became her downfall, as upon seeing the still alive Peter Pettigrew, she easily fell into his trap (which Sirius stated was a high possibility due to her poor personality combination) by accepting his proposal to take a stroll instead of reporting him, thus leading to her capture and delivery to Voldemort's clutches.<ref name=\"GOF35\"/>\n\nAfter being struck by Crouch's intensive Memory Charm, Bertha's short term memory was permanently compromised, leading others to see as a new trait of forgetfulness that nobody questioned about.<ref name=\"GOF5\"/><ref name=\"GOF35\"/> When Voldemort tortured her extensively to break the Memory Charm, it left her damaged beyond repair, physically and mentally,<ref name=\"GOF34\"/> though Pettigrew believed she was still fit enough to have her memories modified again and sent back to the Ministry to avoid suspicions.<ref name=\"GOF1\"/>\n\nUpon her brief return to the mortal realm, Bertha was supportive of Harry Potter, as she moved to haunt Voldemort in order to give Harry time to escape.<ref name=\"GOF34\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nHer first name, Bertha, means \"intelligent\" or \"shining\" \u2014 an ironic first name, as she was gossipy, forgetful and not always wisely cautious about danger. Jorkins may be from Mr Jorkins, a character in Charles Dickens' ''David Copperfield'' and ''A Christmas Carol''.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*She was cut from {{GOF|FA}}, for time reasons.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{GOF}} {{1st}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{PM}} {{Ghost}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Ministry Level 7 employees}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jorkins, Bertha}}\n[[de:Bertha Jorkins]]\n[[fr:Bertha Jorkins]]\n[[it:Bertha Jorkins]]\n[[ru:\u0411\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0430 \u0414\u0436\u043e\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441]]\n[[fi:Bertha Jorkins]]\n[[pl:Berta Jorkins]]\n[[de2:Berta Jorkins]]\n[[Category:1950s births]]\n[[Category:1994 deaths]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Cruciatus Curse victims]]\n[[Category:Daily Prophet staff]]\n[[Category:Deaths by Killing Curse]]\n[[Category:Department of International Magical Co-operation personnel]]\n[[Category:Department of Magical Games and Sports personnel]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts students during the Marauders' era]]\n[[Category:Horcrux victims]]\n[[Category:Jorkins family|Bertha]]\n[[Category:Killed by Lord Voldemort]]\n[[Category:Killed by Peter Pettigrew]]\n[[Category:Return of Lord Voldemort participants]]\n[[Category:Second Wizarding War casualties]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1960s|Jorkins Bertha]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
