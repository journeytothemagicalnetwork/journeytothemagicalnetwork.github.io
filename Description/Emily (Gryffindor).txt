In [[1992]], she became a member of the [[Duelling Club]] and was ranked two on the Club's top-ten duellists list.<ref name=\"COSG\">{{COS|G}} - PC version</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Emily\" is an English feminine form of ''Aemilius''. In the English-speaking world it was not common until after the German House of Hanover came to the British throne in the 18th century; the princess Amelia Sophia (1711-1786) was commonly known as Emily in English, even though Amelia is an unrelated name. Famous bearers include the British author Emily Bront\u00eb (1818-1848), who wrote ''Wuthering Heights'', and the American poet Emily Dickinson (1830-1886).\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{COS|G}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Duelling Club}}\n[[de:Emily]]\n[[fr:Emily (Gryffondor)]]\n[[pl:Emily (Gryffindor)]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Brown-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Duelling Club members]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
