Fawcett''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Ravenclaw]]<ref name=\"gof16\">{{GOF|B|16}}</ref> student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] during the [[1990s]]. She lived with her [[Fawcett family|family]] near [[Ottery St Catchpole]].<ref name=\"gof6\">{{GOF|B|6}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===[[1992\u20131993 school year]]===\nIn [[1992]], she attended the [[Duelling Club]] set up by [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] and received a minor injury. She was probably paired up with another student and started [[duelling]] like everyone else.<ref name=\"COS11\">{{COS|B|11}}</ref>\n\n===[[1994\u20131995 school year]]===\nIn [[1994]], she did not attend the [[Quidditch World Cup]], because her family couldn't get tickets.<ref name=\"gof6\" /> On [[Hallowe'en]], she attempted to place her name in the [[Goblet of Fire]] to participate in the [[Triwizard Tournament]] by using an [[Ageing Potion]]. Because of [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s [[Age Line]], however, she grew a long white beard instead.<ref name=\"gof16\" /> Later, on Christmas Eve, Fawcett attended the [[Yule Ball]] with [[Stebbins (Potter-era)|Stebbins]], and both were docked ten [[House points|points]] by [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] when he caught them together in the rose garden.<ref name=\"gof23\">{{GOF|B|23}}</ref> This suggests that she was a [[fourth year]] or above, as she was able to attend the Yule Ball, unless she was invited by Stebbins (just like [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] was invited by [[Neville Longbottom]] as she didn't have the proper age to attend the Yule Ball at that time); but given that Fawcett and Stebbins were caught together in the rose garden, they might have met each other for a time; they might have been the same age and started attending Hogwarts the same year.\n\nSometime during her time at the school, she borrowed the [[Hogwarts Library|library]] copy of {{QTA}}, and was due to return it on [[16 September]].<ref name=\"QTAR\">{{QTA|R}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Fawcett was portrayed by [[Alex Argenti]] in {{GOF|FA}}, but her scenes were cut from the theatrical version, but appeared in a deleted scene on the DVD of the film. In the scene, she and [[Stebbins (Potter-era)|Stebbins]] are not caught by [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] in the rose bushes, but in a [[Hogwarts Carriages|Hogwarts carriage]] parked in the [[Viaduct Courtyard|Entrance Courtyard]].\n**However, in some television showings, this scene is in the actual film.\n*In the [[Great Britain|British]], [[Canada|Canadian]], [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], Russian, Polish, and Danish editions of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', when Snape catches Fawcett with Stebbins in chapter 23, he says, \"Ten points from [[Hufflepuff]], Fawcett! And ten points from [[Ravenclaw]], too, Stebbins!\", although Fawcett is referred to as a Ravenclaw by [[Albus Dumbledore]] in chapter 16.<ref name=\"lexicon\">\"[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/character/fawcett-family/miss-s-fawcett/ S. Fawcett]\" on The Harry Potter Lexicon</ref> The American edition of the novel amends this error, with Snape taking Fawcett's points from Ravenclaw, and Stebbins' from Hufflepuff.<ref name=\"lexicon\" /> In the ''Goblet of Fire'' film, however, Snape makes a similar error where he refers to Fawcett as a Hufflepuff and Stebbins as a Ravenclaw. The only way it couldn't be a mistake is that Snape mentions the consequences of the partner's rule-breakings.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{COS}} {{1st}}\n*{{GOF}}\n*{{GOF|F}} {{Comment|Deleted scene}}\n*{{QTA|R}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Duelling Club}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fawcett, S.}}\n[[de:Fawcett]]\n[[ru:\u0421. \u0424\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0442\u0442]]\n[[fr:J.
