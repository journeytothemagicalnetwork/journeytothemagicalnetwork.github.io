They took over the positions after [[Fred and George Weasley]], who were given a lifelong ban from [[Quidditch]] by [[Dolores Umbridge]] (their bans were lifted right after Umbridge was removed from Hogwarts). [[Angelina Johnson]], the team Captain, was unimpressed by Andrew and Jack's performances during try-outs, but considered them to be better than the others who had tried out. [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] considered them to be dreadful players, even worse than he was.<ref name=\"OOTP19\">{{OOTP|B|19}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[Gryffindor]]'s quick defeat to [[Hufflepuff]], Andrew had a pitiful performance; when [[Zacharias Smith]] flew in his direction carrying the Quaffle, Andrew shrieked and fell off his broomstick. [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] caught the [[Golden Snitch]] twenty-two minutes into the match, causing Gryffindor to lose by only ten points.<ref name=\"OOTP26\">{{OOTP|B|26}}</ref> Later, after the match with Ravenclaw, he and his teammates victoriously carried Ron.<ref name=\"OOTP30\">{{OOTP|B|30}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Andrew Kirke's name is possibly derived from ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' book ''The Magician's Nephew,'' which features a main character named Digory Kirke with a maternal uncle named Andrew Ketterley.\n**This is the same namesake of fellow [[Portrait of a Quidditch player|Quidditch player]] [[Cedric Diggory]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{OOTP}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kirke, Andrew}}\n\n[[de2:Andrew Kirke]]\n[[de:Andrew Kirke]]\n[[es:Andrew Kirke]]\n[[fr:Andrew Kirke]]\n[[nl:Andr\u00e9 Kolk]]\n[[no:Andor Krikkbukk]]\n[[pl:Andrew Kirke]]\n[[ru:\u042d\u043d\u0434\u0440\u044e \u041a\u0435\u0440\u043a]]\n[[sv:Andrew Kirke]]\n[[zh:\u5b89\u5fb7\u9c81\u00b7\u67ef\u514b]]\n[[Category:Beaters]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
