She has a reputation for eliminating her competition\u2026|Jacob's sibling|And eliminating the few fans in the stands\u2026?|[[Penny Haywood]] and [[Jacob's sibling]] watch Erika Rath commit [[Bumphing|a foul]] during a [[Quidditch friendly]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n'''Erika Rath''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who played as the [[Beater]] on a [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] [[Quidditch team]] in the [[1980s]]. She was also a member of the school's [[Dragon Club]].<ref name=\"ADQ\">{{HM|3|A DRAGON'S QUEST}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nLittle is known about Rath's history before Hogwarts. It is known, that she became acquainted with [[Gwenog Jones]] at some point.<ref name=\"ADQ\">{{HM|3|A DRAGON'S QUEST}}</ref> During her younger years, [[Erika Rath's father|her father]] gave her a copy of {{QTA}} for her birthday.\n\nRath spoke very little, being short and to the point. She was known to be very physical, often practising by hitting [[bludger]]s at [[Mechanical Death Eater|practice dummies]]. She also had a reputation for poor sportsmanship and was thought to deliberately hit bludgers towards the crowd. However, this was never intentional- it was later revealed that she had an abnormally large blind spot in at least one of her eyes and genuinely didn't see the targets she fouled.  \n\nWhen [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Penny Haywood]] were watching a practice match, between Jacob's sibling's House and Rath's House, Rath inadvertently hit a Bludger towards the stands. [[Chaser]] [[Skye Parkin]] reacted and took the hit. Though this action saved the pair from potential injury, it also allowed the [[Seeker]] for Rath's House to catch the [[Golden Snitch]]. This caused Skye to begin to develop a great dislike for Rath. It also resulted in Jacob's sibling playing Quidditch as one of the team's Chasers was injured during the match and Jacob's sibling eventually won the position.<ref name=\"HM2Q11\">{{HM|2|Q1|1}}</ref>    \n\nDuring the [[1985\u20131986 school year]], when the [[Comet 220]] that [[Skye Parkin]] was going to give [[Jacob's sibling]] vanished, she believed that Rath was responsible and spread rumours to this effect in an attempt to put pressure on her to return it. Parkin and Jacob's sibling later discovered that [[Rubeus Hagrid's Crups|Hagrid's crup puppies]], who were teething, had gotten ahold of the broom and chewed it to destruction. Though the misunderstanding was cleared up, Rath was still furious with Jacob's sibling as she believed that they had started the rumours about her.<ref name=\"Comet\">{{HM|2|Q1|9}}</ref> \n\nSkye attempted to clear up the matter with Rath during one of her Bludger practices and was struck by one of them, landing her in the [[Hospital Wing]]. Skye believed that it was revenge but Rath insisted that it was an accident. This led [[Jacob's sibling]] to deduce Rath's disability. They took advantage of this knowledge by instructing teammates to fly near Rath's blind spot when possible during the season's final match between their [[Hogwarts Houses|Houses]] to make the fearsome beater less effective.<ref name=\"HM2Q112\">{{HM|2|Q1|12}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[1986\u20131987 school year]], when Jacob's sibling discovered that [[Gwenog Jones]] may be connected to a [[Gwenog Jones's cursed Bludger|cursed bludger]] that wrecked the [[Dragon Clubhouse]] during that year, Rath contacted Jones and arranged a meeting with Jacob's sibling at the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]].<ref name=\"ADQ\">{{HM|3|A DRAGON'S QUEST}}</ref>\n\nDuring their second season playing Quidditch, Jacob's sibling was appointed a Beater on their house team. They played well enough to defeat Rath's house, eliminating them from the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup]], but as the championship came closer they realized that they would have to address their weaknesses to have a chance to win. Their mutual friend [[Andre Egwu]] suggested that Jacob's sibling ask Rath to help them train.<ref name=\"HM3Q29\">{{HM|3|Q2|9}}</ref>\n\nRath was initially extremely skeptical of their request, given their stormy history and her general opinion of the student, but she decided to give them a chance\u00a0to prove themselves to her. They managed to do so, proving their determination by keeping up with her at her Bludger practice, and agreeing to teach her a manoeuvre that she didn't know in return.<ref name=\"HM3Q29\" />\n\nRath was eventually impressed enough to help them train and the two began a friendship, though this caused Jacob's sibling to have some friction in their relationship with [[Skye Parkin]], due to Skye's great dislike of Rath.<ref name=\"HM3Q29\" />\n\nDuring a practice match of the [[1986\u20131987 school year]], one of Rath's misdirected Bludgers struck [[Orion Amari]] and put him in the [[Hospital Wing]]. Though [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] was able to quickly heal his physical injuries, Orion was badly shaken by the injury and the major argument that broke out between the two teams because of it.<ref name=\"HM4Q31\">{{HM|4|Q5|1}}</ref>\n\n==Physical appearance==\nErika had dark blue eyes, white skin and long, pale blonde hair. She was notable for having a substantial build with very muscular arms, as befitting a female [[Beater]]. It was later revealed that she had a large blind spot in her eye. When not in her Quidditch robes, Rath was usually seen wearing black leggings with a slight tear in one leg, knee-high brown boots, fingerless gloves, and a sleeveless hoody in her house colours, with a black long sleeve shirt underneath.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Erika was a fairly accomplished [[broomstick]] flyer, playing as [[Beater]] for a Hogwarts [[Quidditch]] team, although she was said to possess very poor sportsmanship, often resorting to foul play.\n\n==Possessions==\n*{{QTA}}: Erika's dad gave her copy this book for her birthday.<ref name=\"HM\">{{HM}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Strong and silent, Erika Rath prefers to let her Beater's bat do the talking.

If Jacob's sibling is in [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]] or [[Slytherin]], Rath is in [[Ravenclaw]]. If [[Jacob's sibling]] is in Ravenclaw, Rath is in Slytherin.\n*In official material posted by the creators of {{HM}}, including the loading screen from [[4 September]] to [[10 October]] [[2019]], she is usually shown as a [[Slytherin]].\n**She is often shown as a Slytherin alongside a Gryffindor [[Skye Parkin]].
