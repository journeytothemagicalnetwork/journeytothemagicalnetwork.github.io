[[Rubeus Hagrid]] gave her the last of his [[rose oil]] for an unknown reason, but as Harry Potter needed it to give to [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], she agreed to trade it with him for four [[Fanged Frisbee]]s.<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>\n\nShe presumably came from either a [[pure-blood]] or [[half-blood]] background, as she initially had no idea what a hairdryer was, and upon learning what it did, expressed the opinion, ''\"[[Non-magic people|Muggles]] have so many strange things.\"''<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Amelia\" is a variant of Amalia, though it is sometimes confused with Emilia, which has a different origin. The name became popular in England after the German House of Hanover came to the British throne in the 18th century - it was borne by daughters of George II and George III. Another famous bearer was Amelia Earhart (1897\u20131937), the first woman to make a solo flight over the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*This particular student was only featured in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube)|home console versions]] of {{POA}} and the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Nintendo DS)|mobile and Nintendo DS versions]] of {{HBP}}.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{1st}} {{C|Console versions only}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{C|Mobile and Nintendo DS versions only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fittleworth, Amelia}}\n[[pl:Amelia Fittleworth]]\n[[fr:Amelia Fittleworth]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Hufflepuffs]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
