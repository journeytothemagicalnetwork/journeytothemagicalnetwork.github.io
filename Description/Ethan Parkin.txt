As Quidditch Season 2 is in the [[1986\u20131987 school year]], twenty years before that was the [[1966]]\u2013[[1967]] school year. As such, Ethan most likely started attending Hogwarts at some point between [[1960]] and [[1965]] in order to be in his second to seventh year.</ref>\n|died = \n|blood = \n|marital = \n|nationality = {{GBorIE}}\n|alias = \n|title = [[Chaser]]<ref name=\"TLSQ2\"/>\n|signature = \n|species = [[Human]]\n|gender = Male\n|height = \n|weight = \n|hair = \n|eyes = \n|skin = \n|family = *[[Skye Parkin]] (daughter)\n*Sons\n*[[Parkin family]]\n|romances = \n|animagus = \n|boggart = \n|wand = \n|patronus = \n|job = [[Quidditch]] player\n|house = \n|loyalty = *[[Parkin family]]\n*[[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]\n*[[Wigtown Wanderers]]<ref name=\"TLSQ\">{{HM|2|Q1|9}}</ref>\n}}\n{{Dialogue a-b|Jacob's sibling|She's from some famous Quidditch family, isn't she?|Penny Haywood|Yes, her dad's Ethan Parkin!

According to [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]], even when he played at Hogwarts he usually committed at least one [[Quidditch#Fouls|foul]] per game but he never directly cheated. She compared his rough style to then current Hogwarts player [[Erika Rath]].<ref name=\"TLSQ2\">{{HM|3|Q2|12}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[1966]]\u2013[[1967]] school year, he played in the highest-scoring [[1967 Hogwarts Quidditch final|Quidditch match]] in Hogwarts history, and his team won the match using the [[Power Play]] tactic.<ref name=\"TLSQ2\">{{HM|3|Q2|12}}</ref>\n\nHis daughter, [[Skye Parkin|Skye]], played [[Chaser]] as a student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], in the [[1980s]].<ref name=\"HM\" />\n\nDuring the [[1985\u20131986 school year]], he was injured in a Quidditch match against the [[Montrose Magpies]], resulting in Skye temporarily leaving Hogwarts to check on her father and keep him company as he recovered.<ref>{{HM|2|Q1|3}}</ref> Fortunately, Ethan was recovering rather rapidly and Skye returned in time to compete in the House Qudditch team tryouts that year.<ref>{{HM|2|Q1|4}}</ref>\n\nHe came to watch Skye's first house match, and expected to see a [[Parkin's Pincer]].<ref>{{HM|2|Q1|7}}</ref> After the match, he gave his daughter a new [[Comet 260]].<ref name=\"TLSQ\" />\n\nDuring the [[1986\u20131987 school year]], Ethan Parkin came to Hogwarts during the final match of the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]]. His arrival overshadowed the match and also caused a disruption in the team dynamic of his former House team. When he heard of the team's preparations through [[Orion Amari]]'s softer, more holistic approach, he didn't see the value and effectively took over the teams training before the match.\n\nThis put pressure on the team, which had already been strained by recent personal problems between two of their main players- [[Jacob's sibling]] and Skye. His dominating approach had also put great pressure on Skye, who found it difficult to tell her father how she felt. Eventually Skye and Jacob's sibling confronted him about it in the Quidditch changing room, and Skye finally opened up about all the pressure she had felt from him to live up to his, and [[Parkin family|their family]]'s legacy. Ethan finally realised that, though he may have had the best of intentions for Skye and the team, he had been overly hard on both.\n\nHe agreed to step back and also agreed to teach them the Power Play manoeuvre. He had previously been evasive about his use of the tactic in the legendary House match as it wasn't his usual style, but Jacob's sibling learned about it from Madam Hooch.<ref name=\"TLSQ2\" />\n\nThe [[1987\u20131988 school year|following school year]], Parkin recruited the House team's Keeper as a Wanderers reserve player after their gradation. He came to Hogwarts to help train Jacob's sibling to take over the role, after the student was elected to do so by their teammates.<ref name=\"Q31\">{{HM|4|Q3|1}}</ref> Shortly before the season's first house match, the team's Captain and Chaser, [[Orion Amari]], stepped back after being mentally shaken up by an injury. Skye invited Ethan back to help them train and integrate their reserve Chaser into the team while she and Jacob's sibling jointly took over leadership duties.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*His [[Hogwarts Houses|Hogwarts House]] is the same as that of [[Jacob's sibling]] and his daughter, which is chosen by the player.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n*{{HM}} {{1st Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n{{Quidditch positions}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parkin, Ethan}}\n[[ru:\u0418\u0442\u0430\u043d \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Parkin family|Ethan]]\n[[Category:Quidditch players]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
