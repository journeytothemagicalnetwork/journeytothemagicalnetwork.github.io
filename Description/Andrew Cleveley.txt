This name has been common (in various spellings) throughout the Christian world, and it became very popular in the Middle Ages. Saint Andrew is regarded as the patron of Scotland, Russia, Greece and Romania. The name has been borne by three kings of Hungary, American president Andrew Jackson (1767\u20131845), and, more recently, English composer Andrew Lloyd Webber (1948-).\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{PS2 only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cleveley, Andrew}}\n[[pl:Andrew Cleveley]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
