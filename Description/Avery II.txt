After graduating from Hogwarts, he became a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]].\n\nAvery participated in the [[First Wizarding War]], but like most Death Eaters, didn't search for [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] after his downfall, although he was forgiven after his master's return. During the [[Second Wizarding War]], Avery fought at the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] with a group of Death Eaters, attempting to take a [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|prophecy]] from [[Harry Potter]].<ref name=\"OOTP35\">{{OOTP|B|35}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Hogwarts years===\nAvery attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1970s]] and was sorted into [[Slytherin]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]].<ref name=\"GOF27\">{{GOF|B|27}}</ref> He and his friend [[Mulciber II|Mulciber]] had a dark sense of humour, such as when Mulciber tried to use [[Dark Arts|Dark Magic]] on [[Mary Macdonald]] during the [[1975]]-[[1976]] school year.<ref name=\"DH33\">{{DH|B|33}}</ref>\n\nAvery was also a friend of [[Severus Snape]], something that bothered [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]], who was Snape's best friend at the time. She found Avery's sense of humour to be very sadistic and could not understand how Snape could associate with him.<ref name=\"DH33\" /> According to [[Sirius Black]], Avery was part of a [[Gang of Slytherins|\"gang of Slytherins\"]] who later become [[Death Eaters]] and also included [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Black]], her future husband [[Rodolphus Lestrange]], [[Evan Rosier]], Snape, and [[Wilkes]].<ref name=\"GOF27\" />\n\n===First Wizarding War===\nSometime during the [[First Wizarding War]], Avery was apprehended by [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] officials and stood trial for being a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]. Avery was one of few who \"wormed his way out of trouble\", according to [[Sirius Black]], since he pleaded the [[Imperius Curse]].

Master, forgive me!

He feebly begged Voldemort to forgive all the Death Eaters present for their past disloyalty. Voldemort responded by using the [[Cruciatus Curse]] to sadistically torture him and saying he wanted thirteen years repayment before forgiving the Death Eaters for the lack of belief they had in him.<ref name=\"GOF33\">{{GOF|B|33}}</ref>\n\n====The prophecy====\n{{Quote|Well ... Avery isn\u2019t.... He\u2019s in trouble.... He gave him the wrong information.... He\u2019s really angry....|Harry Potter receiving a vision of Voldemort's activities in his sleep|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}In [[1995]], Voldemort was seeking a [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|prophecy]] that had been made about himself and [[Harry Potter]], a record of which was kept in the [[Department of Mysteries]] in the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Avery told his master that it would be possible to obtain the prophecy by placing [[Unspeakable]] [[Broderick Bode]] under the [[Imperius Curse]] and having him get it for them. This attempt failed, as prophecies are protected by spells that only allow them to be retrieved by the person about whom they are made. Voldemort punished Avery for this mistake.<ref name=\"OOTP26\">{{OOTP|B|26}}</ref>\n\n====Battle of the Department of Mysteries====\n{{Quote|We'll split into pairs and search, and don't forget, be gentle with Potter until we've got the prophecy, you can kill the others if necessary...|[[Lucius Malfoy]] gives orders to the group of Death Eaters|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}Avery later fought at the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] against members of [[Dumbledore's Army]], when he was paired with fellow Death Eater [[Walden Macnair|Macnair]], in an attempt to retrieve the [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|prophecy]] from the [[Department of Mysteries]] for Voldemort.<ref name=\"OOTP35\">{{OOTP|B|35}}</ref> His fate during the battle is unknown, although it is likely he was incapacitated, arrested, and sent to [[Azkaban]], like many of his comrades.\n\nWhether Avery survived the [[Second Wizarding War]] is also unknown.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAvery, when he was a student at Hogwarts, was described by Lily Evans as having an \"evil sense of humour\", indicating that he was a sadist. She also called Avery and Mulciber \"Death Eaters\" before they became two of them, meaning that they had a passion with [[Dark Arts]] and [[Blood status|blood purity]].<ref name=\"DH33\"/> Avery was also disloyal, as he did not search for his master after his downfall. Much like [[Peter Pettigrew]] he was characterised as a weak individual, shown when he cowardly begged Voldemort to forgive him and the other Death Eaters who did not search for him.<ref name=\"GOF33\"/> He also seemed to be incompetent, as his suggestion for helping Voldemort obtain the prophecy about himself and Harry Potter failed miserably<ref name=\"OOTP26\"/> and he was among the Death Eaters defeated in battle with the members of Dumbledore's Army.<ref name=\"OOTP35\"/> It is unknown if his weak and cowardly characteristics were present during his time at Hogwarts or if they developed later in life, though [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]] and [[Sirius Black]] did not seem to regard him with as much disdain as they did towards his [[Gang of Slytherins|friends]].\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': As a Death Eater, Avery would have been accomplished with dark magic and [[dark charm]]s, most likely including the [[Unforgivable Curses]].\n*'''[[Martial magic]]''': Avery was an active Death Eater during the [[First Wizarding War]] and survived to the end, meaning he was a reasonably competent [[Duelling|duellist]] at the least. He also took part in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] where he fought against members of [[Dumbledore's Army]] and the [[Order of the Phoenix]].<ref name=\"OOTP35\"/>\n*'''[[Apparition]]''': Avery was capable of apparition, as he was able to apparate to the [[Little Hangleton]] [[Little Hangleton graveyard|graveyard]] following [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Return of Lord Voldemort|rebirth]].<ref name=\"GOF33\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Avery'' is an English surname derived from an Old French version of the name Alfred. The meaning of the name is derived from the Old English words ''aelf'', meaning elf, and ''raed'', meaning counsel.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*In {{OOTP|FA}}, Avery may have been the one hit by [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] with the [[Reductor Curse]], as this could have been a mirror of a scene in the book in which a Death Eater (either Lucius, Mulciber, Macnair, or Avery) grabs Ginny's foot and has Pluto blown up in his face by Luna).\ufeff\n*In {{GOF|FA}}, Avery was played by [[Richard Rosson]], but was only credited as \"Death Eater\".<ref>{{IMDb name|2055740|Richard Rosson}}</ref> Early screenings of said film are rumoured to have included the part where Voldemort tortures Avery but this is unconfirmed.\n*It's likely that he is the son or other close relation of [[Tom Riddle]]'s [[Avery (Riddle-era)|friend]] with the same [[Avery family|surname]].\n*He may have taken part in the [[Quidditch World Cup]] Riot [[1994|a year before Lord Voldemort returned]], though this is not proven.\n*After his early participation in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, he is no longer directly mentioned in the series.\n**He may be the Death Eater who attempted to escape when [[Albus Dumbledore]] joined the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] or may have been captured and imprisoned in [[Azkaban]], but later escaped in the [[Azkaban escapes|mass breakout]] in [[1997]].\n**It is unconfirmed if he participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{GOF}} {{1st}}\n*{{GOF|F}}\n*{{OOTP}}\n*{{HBP}} {{Mention}}\n*{{DH}} {{Mention}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}} {{Comment|Appears as generic [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]}}\n*{{PM}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Death Eaters}}\n\n[[de:Avery jr.]]\n[[es:Avery (Era de los Merodeadores)]]\n[[et:Avery]]\n[[fi:Avery]]\n[[fr:Avery (\u00e9poque de Severus Rogue)]]\n[[nl:Arduin]]\n[[no:Averson (ukrutt-tiden)]]\n[[pl:Avery (Era Huncwot\u00f3w)]]\n[[sv:Avery]]\n[[ru:\u042d\u0439\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0438]]\n[[pt-br:Avery (era dos Marotos)]]\n[[ja:\u30a8\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30fc2\u4e16]]\n[[Category:Avery family]]\n[[Category:Azkaban convicts]]\n[[Category:Battle of the Department of Mysteries participants]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Cruciatus Curse victims]]\n[[Category:Death Eaters]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts students during the Marauders' era]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pure-blood supremacists]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]"
