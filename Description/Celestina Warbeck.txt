[[18 August]],<ref name=\"Pottermore\" /> [[1917]])<ref name=\"FWC\" /> was a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[half-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and popular singer known as \"''The Singing Sorceress''\". She attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]]. She was often featured on the show called [[Witching Hour]], which runs on the [[Wizarding Wireless Network]].<ref name=\"CoS\">{{COS}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nCelestina Warbeck was born on [[18 August]],<ref name=\"Pottermore\" /> [[1917]]<ref name=\"FWC\" /> in [[Wales]] to a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] father and a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] mother. Her father, a minor functionary in the [[Muggle Liaison Office]], met her mother, a failed actress, when the latter was attacked by a [[Lethifold]] disguised as a stage curtain.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\nCelestina's musical talent was apparent even at an early age; in [[1927]], the wizarding magazine [[Spellbound (magazine)|''Spellbound'']] published an article about her talents when she was around ten years old, referring her as a child prodigy.<ref name=\"COG\">{{COG}} {{See image|File:Spellbound magazine.png}}</ref>\n\nDisappointed to learn that there was no such thing as a wizarding stage school, [[Celestina Warbeck's mother|Mrs Warbeck]] reluctantly let her daughter go to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] (which she attended from [[1928]]-[[1936]] and was Sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]), but frequently bombarded the school with letters to form a theatre club, choir and [[tap-dancing|dancing]] class to showcase her daughter's innumerable talents.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\n===Career as a singer===\n[[File:Celestina_Warbeck-88-chocFrogCard.png|thumb|Celestina Warbeck as depicted on a bronze [[Chocolate Frog Card]]]]\nFrequently appearing with a chorus of backing [[banshee]]s, Celestina's concerts were justly famous. Three devoted fans were involved in a three-broom pile-up over [[Liverpool]] on the last night of her '[[Flighty Aphrodite]]' tour.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" /> Her tickets often went on sale in the black market for vastly inflated prices (one reason why [[Molly Weasley]], who listened to her songs every [[Christmas]],<ref name=\"HBP16\">{{HBP|B|16}}</ref> could never see her favourite singer live).<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\nCelestina's personal life provided much fodder for the gossip columns of the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''. Warbeck became romantically involved with one of her backing dancers early in her career. They married, but ended up divorcing after only a year. Some time later, she married her [[Celestina Warbeck's second husband|manager]], and they had a [[Celestina Warbeck's son|son]] together. However, after ten years of marriage, Warbeck left him in order to marry [[Irving Warble]], a music composer.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\nCelestina sometimes lent her name and talents to good causes, such as raising funds for [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] with a recording of [[Puddlemere United]]'s anthem ''Beat Back Those Bludgers, Boys, and Chuck That Quaffle Here''.<ref name=\"DPN\">{{DP}}</ref><ref name=\"Pottermore\" /> More controversially, Celestina was vocal in her disagreement when the [[Ministry of Magic]] sought to impose restrictions on how the wizarding community was allowed to celebrate [[Hallowe'en]].<ref name=\"QTtA\">{{QTA|R}}</ref>\n\nSome of Celestina's best-known songs include ''[[You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me]]'' and ''A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love''. Her fans are usually older people who love her grandstanding style and powerful voice.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" /> The late 20th-century album ''You Stole My Cauldron but You Can't Have My Heart ''was a massive global hit. She also featured heavily on shows at the [[Wizarding Wireless Network]], one such being the ''[[Witching Hour]]'' hosted by [[Glenda Chittock]].<ref name=\"CoS\" />\n\nCelestina Warbeck had a [[Celestina Warbeck Fan Club|fan club]], established as early as the [[1986\u20131987 school year]].<ref name=\"HM33\">{{HM|3|3}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2003]], she allowed a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[dog]]-walker who accidentally took a [[Portkey]] to one of her concerts to join her on the stage for a duet of ''[[A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love]]''; while the [[Memory Charm]] cast on him by a harassed [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] official appeared at first to have erased his [[memory]] of the incident, he afterwards wrote a popular song that greatly resembled Warbeck's hit, something she was not amused about.<ref name=\"Portkey\">{{WW|portkeys}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of [[2014]], Celestina Warbeck travelled to the [[Patagonian Desert]] to watch the games of the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup|427th Quidditch World Cup]]. Her presence, alongside other wizarding celebrities, was noted by reporter [[Rita Skeeter]] to have caused \"''flurries of excitement''\", with crowd members scrambling for autographs and even attempting to cast [[Bridging Charm]]s to reach the VIP boxes.<ref name=\"PottermoreDP\">{{PM}} - [[DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP FINAL|DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP FINAL\" (Daily Prophet, 08 July 2014)]]</ref>\n\nCelestina's latest album was entitled ''[[You Stole My Cauldron But You Can't Have My Heart]]''. The promotional tour included a show in [[Liverpool]]; fans desperate to arrive at this concert were involved in a three-broom crash.<ref name=\"DPN\" /><ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\nWarbeck scheduled concerts in [[Exmoor Quidditch Stadium|Exmoor]], sponsored by [[The Sorcerer's Saucepot]]. Tickets were on sale for five [[Wizarding currency|Galleons]] each, and fans had to book their [[Portkey]]s early.<ref name=\"JKRS\">{{JKRS}}</ref>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n\n*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': In her free time, Celestina enjoyed breeding [[crup]]s, meaning she had a level of talent in the handling of [[magic]]al creatures.<ref name=\"hobbies\">{{PM}} (2014) - Excerpt here: [https://www.today.com/popculture/j-k-rowling-writes-new-harry-potter-story-about-singing-1D80069158 Read J.K.

Although we never lay eyes on Celestina during the whole seven volumes of the Potter books, I always imagined her to resemble Shirley Bassey in both looks and style.
