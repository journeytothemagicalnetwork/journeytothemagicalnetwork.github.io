The Head of House also serves as a Professor of a subject. Most, if not all, of the heads of [[Slytherin]] house attended Hogwarts and were sorted into Slytherin. It is unknown how a professor would be elected for the post, but it's possible that the headmaster chooses the professor who was sorted into Slytherin and embodies the qualities that house founder [[Salazar Slytherin]] possessed such as determination, resourcefulness, and cunning.<ref name=\"PS7\">{{PS|B|7}}</ref><ref name=\"OOTP11\">{{OOTP|B|11}}</ref>\n\n==Known Heads of Slytherin==\n*[[Salazar Slytherin]] (c. [[11th century|1000]]) Salazar Slytherin established the Slytherin House. He had a very strong belief that only pure-blood witches and wizards should be trained at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Because of his convictions, he often had disagreements with the other founders to the school, particularly [[Godric Gryffindor]].<ref name=\"COS9\">{{COS|B|9}}</ref>\n*[[Horace Slughorn]] (between the [[1920s]] and [[1981]]) Horace was the Potions master and was well-known for his \"[[Slug Club]],\" a group of talented, well-connected, or famous students he favoured.<ref name=\"HBP4\"/><ref name=\"HBP7\">{{HBP|B|7}}</ref> Partly through the Slug Club, Horace developed a very close relationship with [[Tom Riddle]]. He told Tom about [[Horcrux]]es, believing the information he gave out would purely be used for educational purposes.<ref name=\"HBP23\">{{HBP|B|23}}</ref> When later incidents proved otherwise, Horace retired from his position, presumably because he felt ashamed of himself for the mistake he had made.<ref name=\"HBP22\">{{HBP|B|22}}</ref>\n[[File:Severus Snape Profile.jpg|thumb|[[Severus Snape]], Head of Slytherin House from [[1981]] to [[1997]] and later Headmaster]]\n*[[Severus Snape]] (between [[1981]] and [[1990]]\u2013[[1997]]) Severus was the Potions master at Hogwarts,<ref name=\"PS8\">{{PS|B|8}}</ref> and served as a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] for a while. When Snape learned of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s plan to kill the [[Potter family]], likely including [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]] whom Severus had romantic feelings for, Snape served as a double agent, secretly working behind Voldemort's back for [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] even after his death.<ref name=\"DH33\">{{DH|B|33}}</ref> His career ended when [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] killed him in the hopes of gaining the full allegiance of the [[Elder Wand]].<ref name=\"DH32\">{{DH|B|32}}</ref> Snape was a difficult teacher, and was disliked by many students outside of Slytherin House.<ref name=\"PS8\"/><ref name=\"COS5\">{{COS|B|5}}</ref> He had a special dislike for [[Harry Potter]] because of a grudge against Harry's father.<ref name=\"POA14\">{{POA|B|14}}</ref><ref name=\"OOTP28\">{{OOTP|B|28}}</ref> It was also well-known that Snape deeply desired the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] position, but he never got his chance to teach that class until [[1996]].<ref name=\"HBP8\">{{HBP|B|8}}</ref>\n*[[Horace Slughorn]] ([[1997]]\u2013Pre [[2016]])<ref name=\"shortstories\" /> Horace, after being convinced by [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] and [[Harry Potter]], returned to Hogwarts as the Potions master.<ref name=\"HBP4\">{{HBP|B|4}}</ref> After Severus killed Dumbledore and became headmaster of Hogwarts, it was decided that Horace was to become the Head of Slytherin House once again.<ref name=\"HBP29\">{{HBP|B|29}}</ref> Following his second retirement, a portrait of Slughorn was placed in the common room.<ref name=\"shortstories\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Head of Gryffindor House]]\n*[[Head of Hufflepuff House]]\n*[[Head of Ravenclaw House]]\n*[[Slytherin]]\n*[[Professor]]\n*[[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{PS}} {{1st}}\n*{{PS|F}}\n*{{PS|G}}\n*{{COS}}\n*{{COS|F}}\n*{{COS|G}}\n*{{POA}}\n*{{POA|F}}\n*{{POA|G}} {{C|Not in the PC version}}\n*{{GOF}}\n*{{GOF|F}}\n*{{OOTP}}\n*{{OOTP|F}}\n*{{OOTP|G}}\n*{{HBP}}\n*{{HBP|F}}\n*{{HBP|G}}\n*{{DH}}\n*{{DH|F1}} {{Comment|Heard in flashback(s)}}\n*{{DH|F2}}\n*{{CC}} {{Comment|Appears in [[alternate reality]]}}\n*{{CC|P}} {{Comment|Appears in [[alternate reality]]}}\n*{{FB|R}} {{Mention}}\n*{{LEGO|B}}\n*{{LEGO|C}}\n*{{QWC}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}}\n*{{LEGO|C1}}\n*{{LEGO|D}}\n*{{LEGO}}\n*{{TCG}}\n*{{MHP}}\n*{{HPK}}\n*{{PM}}\n*{{WW}}\n*{{TCV|1}}\n*{{TCV|2}}\n*{{HM}}\n*{{WU}}\n*{{PAS}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[es:Jefe de la Casa Slytherin]]\n[[pl:Opiekun Slytherinu]]\n[[pt-br:Diretor da Casa de Sonserina]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043d \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0421\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d]]\n[[Category:Heads of House]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts positions]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]"
