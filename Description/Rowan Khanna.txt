Some of you may know that it was Rowan's ambition to teach at Hogwarts one day. By constantly pursuing new knowledge and instilling a love of learning in ourselves and others, we can honour Rowan's dream.|Albus Dumbledore's eulogy to Rowan|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n'''Rowan Khanna''' ([[December]]<ref name=\"xmas\"/> [[1972]]\u2013[[1990]])<ref name=\"HM619\"/> was a [[Wizardkind|wizard or witch]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1984]]. Their family owned [[Khanna Farms|a farm]] that supplied high-quality wood for the manufacture of [[wand]]s and [[broomstick]]s.\n\nRowan aspired to become the youngest professor in Hogwarts history, but this dream was never realised as a result of their tragic murder at the hands of the [[Dark Wizard|Dark Witch]] [[Patricia Rakepick]] in 1990.<ref name=\"HM618\">{{HM|6|18}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nRowan was born into a British-Indian [[Khanna family|wizarding family]] in [[Great Britain]] in December [[1972]]. Their family owned a [[Khanna Farms|farm]] that supplied high-quality wood for the manufacture of [[wand]]s and [[broomstick]]s.\n\nRowan was interested in reading from a young age. They were considered nerdy and weird by the age of eleven and had never made any friends.<ref name=\"HM11\">{{HM|1|1}}</ref>\n\nWhile shopping for school supplies in [[Diagon Alley]], Rowan met and befriended future fellow student and housemate, [[Jacob's sibling]], to whom Rowan advised starting with [[Flourish and Blotts]]. When the shopping concluded, Rowan and Jacob's sibling promised to see each other again on the train.<ref name=\"HM11\"/>\n\n===Hogwarts years {{C|1984\u20131990}}===\n====First year====\nRowan began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1984]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into the same [[Hogwarts Houses|House]] as [[Jacob's sibling]].<ref name=\"HM12\">{{HM|1|2}}</ref>\n\nBefore the start of their first [[Potions (class)|Potions class]], Jacob's sibling found [[Merula Snyde]], an imperious and cruel [[Slytherin]] witch, trying to bully Rowan into admitting her as the most powerful witch to in Hogwarts. Rowan tried to reason with Merula by listing out other factors, but Merula wouldn't budge, which prompted Jacob's sibling to intervene on Rowan's behalf and stand up for their friend. Professor [[Severus Snape]] ordered them to get into the classroom before the argument could escalate further. Rowan later thanked Jacob's sibling for standing up to Merula for them.<ref name=\"HM12\"/>\n\nLater when their [[Prefect]] decided to teach Jacob's sibling how to duel, Rowan helped Jacob's sibling find a [[Secret duelling book|duelling book]] in the [[Artefact Room]], where Jacob's sibling saw some visions and heard a mysterious voice saying [[Cursed ice|a kind of ice]] was here and [[Vault of Ice|a vault]] would open. Using the duelling book, they learned a new spell before teaching it to Jacob's sibling.<ref name=\"HM14\">{{HM|1|4}}</ref>\n\nAfter Jacob's sibling's duel with Merula, they overheard Professor Snape and [[Argus Filch]] discussing the [[Cursed Vaults]] in a corridor and told Rowan about it. They went back to the corridor with Jacob's sibling and found a locked door. Before they figured out how to open it, [[Mrs Norris]] showed up, prompting them to leave.<ref name=\"HM16\">{{HM|1|6}}</ref>\n\nRowan and Jacob's sibling came up with a plan of brewing a [[Sleeping Draught]] to use on Mrs Norris. After Jacob's sibling brewed it with [[Penny Haywood]], they went back to the door with Jacob's sibling and another friend of them, tricked Mrs Norris into drinking it and opened the door. However, Merula overpowered them and [[Infiltration of the locked room|went in]] first. The door led to [[Room with the cursed ice|a room]] in which they discovered the [[cursed ice]], with Merula trapped in it. The ice spread, blocked the door behind them, and trapped Rowan and their friends too. Jacob's sibling saved them and their other friend reopened the door. Before leaving, Rowan noticed some code written on the wall and remembered it. The code, later deciphered by Rowan, suggested there was an [[Ice Knight]] who stood guard past the [[Vanished Stairs]].<ref name=\"HM19\">{{HM|1|9}}</ref>\n\n====Second year====\nUpon realising [[Ben Copper]]'s disappearance during the [[Start-of-Term Feast]] of the [[1985\u20131986 school year]], Rowan and [[Jacob's sibling]] proceeded to search for their friend. In the [[Artefact Room]], they found [[R's notes#R's note (I)|a note]],<ref name=\"HM21\">{{HM|2|1}}</ref> which Rowan later deciphered, revealing that it was signed by someone using the initial \"[[R]]\" and contained instructions to locate a black quill hidden in a [[common room]] different from their own, which would turn into a note with additional information when [[Untransfiguration|Untransfigured]]. Rowan devised a plan for Jacob's sibling to sneak into the said common room using the [[Shrinking Charm]] during the [[Gryffindor vs Slytherin Quidditch match (1985)|Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin]], with Rowan keeping watch.<ref name=\"HM22\">{{HM|2|2}}</ref>\n\nAfter Jacob's sibling got the black quill, they Untransfigured it to [[R's notes#R's note (II)|another note]], instructing the reader to go to the farthest [[Icy Corridor|corridor]] at the end of the fifth floor, re-[[Transfiguration|Transfigure]] the scroll into a black quill, and return it to the common room in which it had been hidden. They did so, and while inspecting the corridor, they found out the professors were already there. They also found [[Ben Copper|Ben]] frozen in the [[cursed ice]], but the professors saved him by casting the [[Fire-Making Spell]], explaining that the cursed ice appeared to have developed resistance to the [[Knockback Jinx]].<ref name=\"HM23\">{{HM|2|3}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling and Rowan searched the corridor once more and found a wall to be suspicious. They decided to ask [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] to teach them the [[Revealing Charm]]. After learning, they returned to the corridor and used it to find the [[Vanished Stairs]]. The stairs led to [[Cursed Corridor|another mysterious corridor]], which ended in a kind of mist. Jacob's sibling used the [[Knockback Jinx]] to clear the mist and revealed a hidden door covered with ice. They tried opening it but Rowan got hurt by some flying ice, so Jacob's sibling sent Rowan to the [[Hospital Wing]].<ref name=\"HM24\">{{HM|2|4}}</ref> When visiting Rowan, Jacob's sibling brought a book about [[Wendelin the Weird]], much to Rowan's delight. Rowan confessed being quite shaken up by the incident in the corridor and suggested Jacob's sibling seeking help from someone more powerful, namely [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], who Rowan held in great admiration.<ref name=\"HM25\">{{HM|2|5}}</ref>\n\nAfter befriending Bill, Jacob's sibling taught Rowan some more spells.<ref name=\"HM28\">{{HM|2|8}}</ref> It was possible that Rowan helped them [[Infiltration of the Vault of Ice (1986)|break into]] the [[Vault of Ice]] near the end of the school year.<ref name=\"HM210\">{{HM|2|10}}</ref>\n\n====Third year====\n{{Expand}}\nDuring the beginning of their third year, Rowan was excited to go to visit [[Hogsmeade]], and discussed their excitement with [[Nymphadora Tonks]]. They were also present when their head of house told [[Jacob's sibling]] that their grades were not good enough to be allowed to visit Hogsmeade.<ref name=\"HM31\">{{HM|3|1}}</ref>\n\nRowan accompanied Jacob's sibling on their first visit to Hogsmeade and the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]], where they shared [[Butterbeer]] with [[Rubeus Hagrid]] while Jacob's sibling asked [[Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]] about their [[Jacob's notebooks|brother's notebooks]] about the [[Cursed Vaults]].<ref name=\"HM33\">{{HM|3|3}}</ref>\n\nAfter Jacob's sibling acquired one of the notebooks, Rowan deciphered it and learned about [[Jacob's room|a room]] where [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] researched the Cursed Vaults.<ref name=\"HM35\">{{HM|3|5}}</ref>\n\nRowan possibly accompanied Jacob's sibling, [[Tulip Karasu]] and [[Barnaby Lee]] during their [[Infiltration of the Vault of Fear (1987)|break-in]] of the [[Vault of Fear]].<ref name=\"HM39\">{{HM|3|9}}</ref>\n\n====Fourth year====\n{{Expand}}\nRowan possibly accompanied Jacob's sibling, [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]] and [[Rubeus Hagrid]] during their [[Infiltration of the Forest Vault (1988)|break-in]] of the [[Forest Vault]].<ref name=\"HM416\">{{HM|4|16}}</ref>\n\n====Fifth year====\n{{Expand}}\nDuring Rowan's [[fifth year]], they sometimes unofficially taught the [[History of Magic]] class during [[Cuthbert Binns|Professor Binn]]'s frequent naps or inattention, due to their ambitions of becoming a professor at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] after graduation. Partly because of this, Roawn actually considered the subject their favourite, as it allowed them to practice their teaching technique.\n\nRowan was placed under the [[Imperius Curse]] (one of the [[Unforgivable Curses]]) by an unknown caster, causing them to behave completely out of character all of a sudden in the [[Clock Tower Courtyard]]. They then threatened [[Jacob's sibling]] with the message that \"[[death]] was coming to Hogwarts\", and threatened to kill one of the student's friends. They quickly incapacitated [[Barnaby Lee]] with a spell, but were then quickly stunned with the [[Knockback Jinx]] by [[Ben Copper]]. They were sent to the [[Hospital Wing]] after the incident.<ref name=\"HM519\">{{HM|5|19}}</ref>\n\n====Sixth year and death====\nDuring the [[1989\u20131990 school year]], their [[sixth year]], Rowan proceeded to take [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] level [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]],<ref name=\"HM61t\">{{HM|6|1|t}}</ref> [[Charms (class)|Charms]],<ref name=\"HM61c\">{{HM|6|1|c}}</ref> [[Herbology]],<ref name=\"HM62h\">{{HM|6|2|h}}</ref> [[Potions (class)|Potions]],<ref name=\"HM63p\">{{HM|6|3|p}}</ref> [[Care of Magical Creatures]],<ref name=\"HM63cmc\">{{HM|6|3|cmc}}</ref> and [[History of Magic]].<ref name=\"HM62hm\">{{HM|6|2|hm}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rowan Death.gif|250px|thumb|Rowan's death at the hands of Rakepick]]\nSometime during the school year, [[Jacob's sibling]], [[Merula Snyde]], and [[Ben Copper]] went into the [[Forest Grove]] to intercept a possible meeting between [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] and [[R]], unknowingly being followed from a close distance behind them by Rowan. During the search, a swarm of [[dementor]]s showed up, and circled the group. However, the [[Dark Wizard|Dark Witch]] [[Patricia Rakepick]] [[Apparition|Apparated]] into the vicinity and cast a powerful [[Patronus Charm]], which warded off all of the dementors. She then engaged in a [[Duel in the Forest Grove|duel]] with the students, which was watched by Rowan. At some point in the duel, she cast a [[Killing Curse]] at Ben, intending to kill him. However, Rowan sacrificed their life by jumping in front of Ben, ending their life and saving that of their friends.<ref name=\"HM618\">{{HM|6|18}}</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|Last night we suffered an unimaginable loss at the hands of unimaginable evil.

In particular to suffer were [[Jacob's sibling]], [[Ben Copper]], and [[Merula Snyde]], all of whom had watched them die. A memorial service took place in the Great Hall, where Professor Dumbledore gave a brief eulogy of Rowan's life, aspirations and sacrifice before leading the students and staff in raising their wands as a tribute to Rowan.<ref name=\"HM619\"/>\n\nRowan's murder prompted a vengeful Jacob's sibling, Merula and Ben to form their own secret organisation to combat the malevolent \"R\" and get revenge on Rakepick for what she had done.<ref name=\"HM619\">{{HM|6|19}}</ref> The organisation was named [[Circle of Khanna]] in memory of Rowan.<ref name=\"HM620\">{{HM|6|20}}</ref>\n\n==Physical description==\nRowan had black hair, brown skin, and wore glasses. They tended to wear regular [[Hogwarts uniform]] robes most of the time, although they wore blue [[dress robes]] to the [[Celestial Ball]]. They were known to snore heavily.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nRowan Khanna was a voracious reader and aspired to be the youngest professor at Hogwarts. They were very driven towards their goal. They once said the only thing they enjoy more than reading is planning. Their favourite professor was [[Albus Dumbledore]] and their favourite game was [[Gobstones]]. Their favourite sweet was Sugar Quills.\n\nRowan was an incredibly brave, loyal, and selfless individual, shown by their loyalty towards their friends, mostly their best friend, [[Jacob's sibling]]. Ultimately, Rowan sacrificed their own life to protect [[Ben Copper|Ben Copper,]] even though they deeply mistrusted him, from the [[Killing Curse]] cast by [[Patricia Rakepick]] at the [[Forbidden Forest]] during their sixth year.\n\nRowan also was a bit of a cheater, as they often cheated when playing Wizard's Chess with [[Jacob's sibling]] by distracting them and quickly changing the chess pieces, however that might have been because [[Jacob's sibling]] also did the same while playing gobstones with them.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n{{Quote|Rowan Khanna is exceptionally bright.|[[Albus Dumbledore]] regarding Rowan's intelligence|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n*'''[[Wandlore]]''': Having grown up on a wand-tree farm, Rowan had an impressive knowledge of [[wand wood]]s, being able to recognise them at first sight.\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Although Charms was never one of their strong suits and they often required tutoring from Jacob's sibling, Rowan was still able to achieve either an ' [[Exceeds Expectations]]' or '[[Outstanding]]' on their O.W.L. exam to be able to study the subject further at N.E.W.T.-level, thus showcasing their skill in the magical subject.\n*'''[[Potion]]s''': While not as proficient as their best friend [[Jacob's sibling]] in the art of potion-making, Rowan was still shown to be particularly knowledgeable in the nature and effects of various concoctions. During their very first-ever Potions lesson, Rowan was able to swiftly identify the substance that Jacob's sibling's cauldron was coated with to be [[Bulbadox powder]], succinctly describing its explosive effects to Jacob's sibling. They later achieved an '[[Outstanding]]' on their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] exam to be able to advance to the [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level Potions class taught by [[Severus Snape]],<ref>During his tenure as [[Potions Master]], Severus Snape only accepted students who achieved an '[[Outstanding]]' on their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] into his [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T]].-level [[Potions (class)|Potions classes]]. Since Rowan was able to advance to N.E.W.T.-level Potions, they must have achieved an 'Outstanding' on their O.W.L. exam.</ref> thus proving themselves adept in the subject.\n*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Rowan was proficient in Transfiguration, as they earned either an ' [[Exceeds Expectations]]' or '[[Outstanding]]' on their O.W.L. exam to be able to study the subject further at N.E.W.T.-level, thus showcasing their skill in the magical subject.\n*'''[[Herbology]]''': Rowan was proficient in Herbology, as they were able to achieve an O.W.L. on the subject and study it further at N.E.W.T.-level, thus showcasing their skill in the magical field. Despite this, they considered it as one of their weak subjects.\n*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': Rowan was proficient at caring for magical creatures, being able to achieve an O.W.L. on the subject and study it further at N.E.W.T.-level, thus showcasing their skill in the subject.\n*'''[[History of Magic]]''': Arguably their most favourite subject out of all the magical fields taught at Hogwarts, Rowan was considerably knowledgeable and well-read in magical history, having read ''[[Hogwarts: A History]]'' in anticipation of their first year to such detail that they considered themselves an expert on Hogwarts. They possessed an almost manic enthusiasm for the subject and often taught their History of Magic class with such passion that, despite the subject's notoriety for being extremely dull, their lectures appealed to the entire class, with their best friend [[Jacob's  sibling|Jacob's sibling]] even noting that Rowan's zeal was infectious. They would go on to achieve an O.W.L. on the subject and study it further at N.E.W.T.-level. Indeed, [[Professor]] [[Cuthbert Binns]] would mournfully acknowledge Rowan to be a brilliant student following their death, and conducted a lesson on the similarly life-changing event of the dissolving of the [[Wizards' Council]] in honour of them.\n*'''Intellectual giftedness''': Rowan Khanna was exceptionally intelligent, perceptive and well-read, having been an excellent academic achiever through their Hogwarts years, with [[Albus Dumbledore]] himself acknowledging their high intelligence. As such, Rowan was able to consistently aid their best friend [[Jacob's sibling]] with useful insights or observations, making them an invaluable member in Jacob's sibling's band of misfits.\n*'''Teaching skills''': Rowan was an excellent teacher of [[History of Magic]], as they often intervened to teach the class whenever [[Professor]] [[Cuthbert Binns]] became distracted. Under their tutelage, the entire class was not only attentive to Rowan's lessons (despite the subject's infamy for being extremely dull) but also able to pass their History of Magic O.W.L. and study the subject further at N.E.W.T.-level, which is a testament to Rowan's superb skills at teaching others.\n\n==Possessions==\n*'''[[Wand]]''': Rowan likely purchased their wand before starting their [[first year]] at Hogwarts in [[1984]], which was of an unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]].\n*'''[[Fuzzclaw]]''': Rowan owned a male [[cat]] called Fuzzclaw, who they often missed whilst at Hogwarts, meaning the cat lived at home with their family.\n*'''[[Ptolemy]] [[Chocolate Frog Card]]''': During their second year, Rowan told Jacob's sibling that they had finally found Ptolemy's Chocolate Frog card after searching for it.<ref name=\"HM2SC\">{{HM|2|Scaredy-Cats}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"''Rowan''\" comes from the Irish word \"''Ruadh\u00e1in''\", which means \"''red-haired''\" or in this instance might be a British derivative for 'Rohan' - a common Indian first name. \"Rowan\" is also an epicene name which fits either gender. \"''Khanna''\" is a surname of members or descendants of members of the {{w|Khatri|Khatri clan}} from the Indian Dhai Ghar community.\n\n[[Rowan]] is also a type of [[Rowan|wood]] used for wands.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Rowan Khanna is a voracious reader and aspires to be the youngest professor at Hogwarts.
