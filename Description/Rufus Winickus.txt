Several early saints had this name, including one mentioned in one of Paul's epistles in the New Testament. As a nickname it was used by William II Rufus, a king of England, because of his red hair. It came into general use in the English-speaking world after the Protestant Reformation.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*This character is mentioned only on a plaque that was featured in at least one of the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]].<ref name=\"plaque\" /> His name is presumably a tribute to [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0935101/ Ruth Winick], who worked as a graphic artist on ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Philosopher's Stone]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Chamber of Secrets]]'', and as a draughtsman on ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Goblet of Fire]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter films]]'' {{Comment|Name appears on plaque}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=[[Jo King (Slytherin)|Jo King]]\n|position=[[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] of the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]]\n|years=[[1956]]-[[1960]]\n|successor=[[Jody Jacknife]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Winickus, Rufus}}\n\n[[es:Rufus Winickus]]\n[[pl:Rufus Winickus]]\n[[pt-br:Rufo Winickus]]\n[[Category:1940s births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts Quidditch Captains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
