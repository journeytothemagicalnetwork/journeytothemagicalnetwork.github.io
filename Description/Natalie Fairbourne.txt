She agreed to give this figurine to [[Harry Potter]] if he could beat her at a game of Exploding Snap.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Natalie\" is from the Late Latin name Natalia, which meant \"Christmas Day\" from Latin natale domini. This was the name of the wife of the 4th-century martyr Saint Adrian of Nicomedia. She is venerated as a saint in the Orthodox Church, and the name has traditionally been more common among Eastern Christians than those in the West. It was popularised in America by actress Natalie Wood (1938-1981), who was born to Russian immigrants, and is now considered a fairly common name.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*This particular student was only featured in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|PlayStation 2 version]] of {{POA}} and the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|Nintendo DS version]] of {{HBP}}.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{PS2 only}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fairbourne, Natalie}}\n[[pl:Natalie Fairbourne]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Exploding Snap players]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
