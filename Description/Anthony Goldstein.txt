[[1980]]) was a [[half-blood]]<ref name=\"blood\" /> [[wizardkind|wizard]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]]. He was Sorted into [[Ravenclaw]] house. In his fifth year he was selected as one of his House's [[prefect]]s<ref name=\"Prefect\" /> and joined [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation taught and lead by [[Harry Potter]].<ref name=\"DA\" /> Anthony later fought beside fellow D.A. members in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] the last battle of the [[Second Wizarding War]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nAnthony was born into the [[Goldstein family]]. He had at least one magical parent<ref name=\"blood\" /> and was distantly related to [[Porpentina Goldstein|Porpentina]] and [[Queenie Goldstein]].<ref name=\"JKR-twitter-goldstein\" /> He was also [[Judaism|Jewish]].<ref name=\"Jew\">[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling J.K.

He befriended dorm-mates [[Terry Boot]] and [[Michael Corner]], and was also on speaking terms with [[Ernest Macmillan]].<ref name=\"OPg\">{{OOTP|G}}</ref>\n\n====Fifth year====\n{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione Granger|I had the idea \u2014 that it might be good if people who wanted to study [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] \u2014 and I mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us because nobody could call that Defence Against the Dark Arts\u2014 |Anthony|Hear, hear.|Anthony agreeing with [[Hermione Granger]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n\n[[File:D.a. hogs head.jpg|250px|thumb|The first D.A. meeting that Anthony attended in the Hog's Head]]\n\nIn his fifth year, Anthony was made one of [[Ravenclaw]]'s new [[prefect]]s, alongside [[Padma Patil]].<ref name=\"Prefect\" /> He, Michael, and Terry attended the meeting in the [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]] to discuss learning defensive and offensive magic from [[Harry Potter]]. Anthony vocally agreed with Hermione Granger that [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s Defence Against the Dark Arts classes were useless, as they were only being taught the theory, which is not enough.<ref name=\"OP16\">{{OOTP|B|16}}</ref> He signed the [[Dumbledore's Army]] parchment and joined the group.<ref name=\"OP18\">{{OOTP|B|18}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Anthony golstein.PNG|239x239px|thumb|left|Anthony speaking to Harry Potter about the location of the D.A]]\n\nHermione, Harry Potter, and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] met Anthony outside of the hospital wing and told him of the location of the D.A. meetings \u2014 in the [[Room of Requirement]] \u2014 and how to access it.<ref name=\"OPg\" /> He was paired with [[Zacharias Smith]] in one such meeting to practise the [[Disarming Charm]]. However, whenever Zacharias opened his mouth to cast the spell and disarm Anthony, [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] would slyly disarm him.<ref name=\"OP18\" />\n\nAnthony took his practical [[Charms (class)|Charms]] [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] at the same time as [[Gregory Goyle]], Hermione and [[Daphne Greengrass]].<ref name=\"OP31\">{{OOTP|B|31}}</ref> He did well enough in his exams to stay on for [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.s]].\n\nOn the [[Hogwarts Express]] after the school year's conclusion, Anthony sat in a compartment with Terry, Michael, [[Hannah Abbott]], [[Susan Bones]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], and [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]]. Gregory Goyle, [[Vincent Crabbe]], and [[Draco Malfoy]] attempted to attack Harry on the train outside of their compartment, but the seven of them used a variety of jinxes and hexes that Harry had taught them, after which the Slytherins resembled three gigantic slugs.<ref name=\"OP38\">{{OOTP|B|38}}</ref>\n\n====Seventh year====\n{{Quote|Both Patil twins were there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan, Anthony Goldstein, and Michael Corner.|The D.A. members residing in the Room of Requirement|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\n\n[[File:B7C36M2 Voldemort vanquished.png|250px|thumb|Anthony and the other defenders of Hogwarts witness Harry Potter's final defeat of Voldemort]]\n\nAnthony was part of the revived DA during the [[1997\u20131998 school year|1997-1998 school year]], hiding in the [[Room of Requirement]].<ref name=\"DH29\">{{DH|B|29}}</ref> He bravely fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. It can be assumed that he survived the final battle, since he was not mentioned among the [[Fallen Fifty]]. After the battle he most likely kept his [[Dumbledore's Army coin|D.A. coin]], as a badge of honour, as did other D.A. members.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAnthony was a very friendly and good-natured individual,<ref name=\"OPg\" /> who was willing to disobey and risk being punished by [[Dolores Umbridge]] in opposition to her tyranny over [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], as a devoted member of [[Dumbledore's Army]]. He was also very courageous and determined, as he bravely fought against the [[Death Eaters]] in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] along with most of his friends and fellow students to defend his school.<ref name=\"DH29\"/>\n\n==Magical skills and abilities==\n*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': As a committed and loyal member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], Anthony would have learnt how to cast multiple highly practical defensive and offensive [[spell]]s, under the masterful teaching of [[Harry Potter]].<ref name=\"OP18\"/><ref name=\"OP38\"/>\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': Anthony was shown to be a skilled duellist with a high level talent in [[martial magic]]. Anthony and his friends at the end of the [[1995\u20131996 school year|1995-1996 school year]] were able to successfully duel and defeat [[Draco Malfoy]], [[Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] after they tried to attack Harry Potter on the [[Hogwarts Express]]. They were able to successfully cast various unpleasant offensive spells on them, that they at the end of the duel resembled [[slug]]s.<ref name=\"OP38\"/> Furthermore, Anthony bravely fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]], along his D.A. comrades against the [[Death Eaters]] and presumably survived. \n*'''[[Charm]]s''': He was capable of producing a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]],<ref name=\"LEGOY2\"/> a mark of superior [[magic]]al ability and talent, given the immense difficulty of casting such an advanced and powerful protective charm. He presumably learnt how to cast this charm with the help of Dumbledore's Army's Patronus lesson. \n\n==Etymology==\nAnthony was an [[Egypt]]ian ascetic monk considered to be the founder of Christian monasticism. Goldstein is a relatively common Jewish surname, which is a part of his Jewish heritage.<ref name=\"Jew\"/>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Anthony was voiced by [[Tom Wheatley]] in the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{OOTP}}.\n*In {{OOTP|G}}, Anthony was portrayed as light skinned with blond hair and blue eyes. He was slightly shorter than [[Harry Potter]].<ref name=\"OPg\" />\n*From the student list seen in {{HPM}}, it can be gleaned that Anthony was originally intended to be a [[Hufflepuff]].\n*Anthony was the first character to be identified as Jewish, the information being revealed by [[J. K. Rowling]] on Twitter as an example of a Jewish person attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].<ref name=\"Jew\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Anthony Goldstein}}\n[[File:Antony lego.jpg|thumb|Anthony in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]\n*{{OOTP}} {{1st}}\n*{{OOTP|F}} {{C|Name appears on [[Dumbledore's Army parchment|parchment]]}} {{Possible}}\n*{{OOTP|G}}\n*{{DH}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}} {{C|DS and PSP versions only}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}} {{C|Consoles and Windows versions}}\n*{{PM}}\n*{{WW}} \n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=Unknown, eventually<br/>[[Marcus Turner]]\n|position=Male [[Prefect#Ravenclaw|prefect of Ravenclaw House]]<br/>(along with two other male Ravenclaws in different years taking the post)\n|years=[[1995]]\u2014[[1998]]\n|successor=Unknown\n}}\n{{End box}}\n{{Dumbledore's Army}}\n{{Head boys and prefects}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Goldstein, Anthony}}\n\n[[de:Anthony Goldstein]]\n[[de2:Anthony Goldstein]]\n[[es:Anthony Goldstein]]\n[[fr:Anthony Goldstein]]\n[[it:Anthony Goldstein]]\n[[ja:\u30a2\u30f3\u30bd\u30cb\u30fc\u30fb\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30f3]]\n[[nl:Anton Goldstein]]\n[[pl:Anthony Goldstein]]\n[[pt-br:Ant\u00f4nio Goldstein]]\n[[ru:\u042d\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439\u043d]]\n[[zh:\u5b89\u4e1c\u5c3c\u00b7\u6208\u5fb7\u65af\u5766]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:Battle of Hogwarts participants]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Dumbledore's Army]]\n[[Category:Goldstein family]]\n[[Category:Half-bloods]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts prefects]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws Sorted in 1991]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
