He was executed by an improper decapitation, after he had a [[magic]]al mishap with [[Lady Grieve]], in which he tried to [[Teeth-straightening spell|straighten her teeth]] but it backfired and she grew tusks.

He was certain he could straighten her crooked teeth, but his attempt to do so backfired, causing her to grow a tusk.<ref name=\"background\" />\n\nSir Nicholas was immediately taken into custody and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] as a result of this mistake. Before being locked in a dungeon, his [[wand]] was taken from him, thus preventing him from using [[magic]] to escape.<ref name=\"TBB\" /> Throughout the night he cried that he would soon undo the damage done to [[Lady Grieve]].<ref name=\"background\" />\n\nA priest came to Sir Nicholas's cell to comfort him and escort him to the execution site at dawn the following day. He became a \"gibbering wreck\" when the executioner told him to kneel before the block. However, the executioner's [[axe]] was blunt, as the grindstone used to sharpen it had been misplaced. Thus, it took forty-five hacks to kill Sir Nicholas and even then his head was only partially severed. Naturally, these acts of betrayal and idiocy alone were not enough to condemn Sir Nicholas to such a brutal death, but the rampant acts of previous juvenile encounters led to an unsympathetic public.<ref name=\"background\" />\n\n[[Albus Dumbledore]] explained in his notes on \"[[The Wizard and the Hopping Pot]]\" that Muggle executions of wizards such as Sir Nicholas were rarely successful, given that wizards could magically protect themselves and escape.<ref name=\"TBB\"/> Sir Nicholas had his wand taken away, however, thus was unable to leave his dungeon cell.<ref name=\"background\"/>\n\n===Post-mortem===\n{{Quote|I was afraid of death.

Sir Nicholas was of the opinion that the [[poltergeist]] gave the ghosts a bad name with his misdoings, while the Friar wanted to \"forgive and forget\".

Sir Nicholas convinced [[Peeves]] to smash the school's [[Vanishing Cabinet]] over the office as a distraction.

Sir Nicholas greeted the attendees at the entrance of the dungeon in which the party was held. The trio did not find this party fun in the least and were eager to leave. The trio was also disgusted by the rotten and mouldy food that was present.

This left Sir Nicholas humiliated and embarrassed for the remainder of his party. It is unknown what happened after the trio left, but it can be assumed that the party did not get any better for Sir Nicholas. Later that same evening, a message was left on one of the Castle's walls, announcing the opening of the [[Chamber of Secrets]] and [[Mrs Norris]], Argus Filch's [[cat]], was found [[Petrification|petrified]].<ref name=\"CS8\" /><ref name=\"CS9\">{{COS|B|9}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nick petrified.jpg|244x244px|thumb|left|[[Harry Potter]] stumbles upon a Petrified Sir Nicholas]]\n\nLater in the year, on [[18 December]], [[1992]] Sir Nicholas was petrified on one of the Castle's corridors, along with [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]].<ref name=\"CS11\">{{COS|B|11}}</ref> Sir Nicholas inadvertently saved Justin's life by taking the brunt of the [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk's]] otherwise-lethal gaze, with Justin seeing the basilisk through Nick rather than being directly exposed to its vision.

The timeline was later reinforced in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]]'' on [[James Potter I|James]] and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]]'s graves.\n*In the first draft of {{COS}}, Nick sang a [[The Ballad of Nearly Headless Nick|self-penned ballad]] explaining how his head had (nearly) come off. There was a [[Priest who comforted Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|priest]] who comforted him.\n*While most of the Hogwarts students call him \"Nearly Headless Nick\", he prefers the more formal \"Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington\" or \"Sir Nicholas\". [[Harry Potter|Harry]], however, also calls him Nick. The fact that he prefers to be called Sir Nicholas is only mentioned in the first book and film.\n*It is unknown as to how he recovered from petrification by the [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk]], since he is unable to drink [[potion]]s.\n* In the PS1 versions of the first two video games, he is seen wearing a high hat and his head constantly falls off to the side.\n*In the German translation of the second game (PS1 version), Nicholas states that it is his 150th deathday. Which would incorrectly place his death in [[1842]].\n*Sir Nicholas was the first ghost named in the series.\n*Sir Nicholas is the only House Ghost who did not live during the founders' time.\n*The manner of Sir Nicholas's death may be a reference to {{wplink|Jack Ketch}}, an executioner in the service of King Charles II, who was infamous for taking multiple attempts to perform his executions.\n\n== Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington}}\n[[File:Nearly Headless Nick - PAS.png|150px|thumb|Nearly Headless Nick as he appears in {{PAS}}]]\n\n*{{PS}} {{1st}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{PS|F}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{PS|G}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{COS}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{COS|F}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{COS|G}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{POA}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{GOF}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{OOTP}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{OOTP|F}} {{Comment|Cut from final edit}}\n*{{OOTP|G}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{HBP}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{DH}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{PM}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{WW}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{JKRS}} {{Mention}}\n*{{TBB|R}} {{Mention}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{LEGO}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{LEGO|D}} {{Mention}}\n*{{TCG}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{PM}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{WW}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{HPV|CH}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{HM}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{WU}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{PAS}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{MA}} {{Ghost}}\n\n== Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mimsy-Porpington, Nicholas}}\n\n==External links==\n\n*[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=11 Extra information about Nearly Headless Nick from J.K.
