He was the younger brother of [[Marilyn]] and collected beetle pincers like his sister, although he raved that his collection was much better than hers. He also owned a \"smashing\" collection of non-magical cricket balls.<ref name=\"COSG\">{{COS|G}} {{C|PC version}}</ref>\n\nArthur and his sister were both described by other students as \"a bit off.\"<ref name=\"COSG\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe meaning of the name ''Arthur'' is unknown. It could be derived from British ''art'' \"bear\" combined with ''viros'' \"man\", or it could be related to Irish ''art'' \"stone\". Alternatively it could be related to an obscure Roman family name ''Artorius''. Arthur is the name of the central character in Arthurian legend, a 6th-century king of the Britons who presided over the knights of the Round Table.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*While Arthur appears to be of African descent, Marilyn is Caucasian and blonde.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{COS|G}} {{1st}} {{C|PC version}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[de:Arthur (Spiel 2)]]\n[[pl:Artur (Hufflepuff)]]\n[[fr:Arthur]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Brown-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Hufflepuffs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
