This is a rhetorical question, implying no person is like God. Saint Michael was one of the seven archangels in Hebrew tradition and the only one identified as an archangel in the Bible.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*This character only appears in {{POA|FA}}. Portrayed by [[Lewis Barnshaw]], he is seen briefly, during the match between [[Gryffindor]] and [[Hufflepuff]]. His name is not given in the film, but was revealed in an interview with Lewis in ''[[Wikipedia:The Stage|The Stage]]'', a [[Great Britain|British]] theatre magazine.<ref name=\"thestage\" />\n*Michael's presence as a [[Beater]] on the Hufflepuff team while it was captained by [[Cedric Diggory]] conflicts with the player roster from the video game {{QWC}}. In this game, Hufflepuff's Beaters are [[Anthony Rickett]] and [[Maxine O'Flaherty]], but it is possible that Michael was a reserve team member, who played in the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff match only because Anthony or Maxine was unable to do so. Alternatively, Anthony and/or Maxine may have been on the team in the [[1992\u20131993 school year]], but not during the following term. However, Cedric Diggory is not known to have been captain before 1993-1994.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|F}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McManus, Michael}}\n[[es:Michael McManus]]\n[[pl:Michael McManus]]\n[[no:Michael McManus]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0430\u0439\u043a\u043b \u041c\u0430\u043a\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0443\u0441]]\n[[Category:Beaters]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Hufflepuffs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
