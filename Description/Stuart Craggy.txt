It is ultimately derived from Old English ''stig'' \"house\" and ''weard'' \"guard\". As a given name, it arose in 19th-century Scotland in honour of the Stuart royal family, which produced several kings and queens of Scotland and Britain between the 14th and 18th centuries.\n*\"Craggy\" is another term for rugged and uneven terrain.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*This individual's name is clearly a reference to [[Stuart Craig]], production designer for all the eight ''Harry Potter'' films.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]] {{Comment|Name appears on plaque}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=[[Jody Jacknife]]\n|position=[[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] of the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]]\n|years=[[1964]]-[[1968]]\n|successor=[[Steve Laughalot]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Craggy, Stuart}}\n\n[[es:Stuart Craggy]]\n[[pl:Stuart Craggy]]\n[[pt-br:Stuart Craggy]]\n[[ru:\u0421\u0442\u044e\u0430\u0440\u0442 \u041a\u0440\u044d\u0433\u0433\u0438]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts Quidditch Captains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
