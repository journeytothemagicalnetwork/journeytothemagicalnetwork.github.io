She was also a member of the [[Duelling Club]].<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[1993]], she could be found in the [[Fat Lady's Corridor]].<ref name=\"POAG\">[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube)]]</ref> She was a fan of [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], and spent the summer of [[1996]] reading his books, of which ''[[Magical Me]]'' was her favourite. After returning to school for the [[1996\u20131997 school year]], she ran a [[Duelling Club]] in the [[Middle Courtyard|Transfiguration Courtyard]], which also included [[Shoma Ichikawa]] and [[Rhonda Fladbury]]. She offered [[sloth brain]]s as a reward to everyone who beat her in a [[Duelling|duel]].<ref name=\"HBPG\">{{HBP|G}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Helen\" is the English form of the Greek \u2018\u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7 (''Helene''), probably from Greek \u2018\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7 (''helene'') \"torch\" or \"corposant\", or possibly related to \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b7 (''selene'') \"moon\". In Greek mythology Helen was the daughter of Zeus and Leda, whose kidnapping by Paris was the cause of the Trojan War.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*This particular student was only featured in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube)|console versions]] of {{POA}} and the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|Nintendo DS version]] of {{HBP}}.\n*If Helen is indeed related to John Dawlish, her mandatory attendance at Hogwarts, where she was at the mercy of the Carrows, presumably played a part in his cooperation with the Death Eater-controlled Ministry.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{c|console versions only}} {{1st}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Duelling Club}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dawlish, Helen}}\n\n[[es:Helen Dawlish]]\n[[ru:\u0425\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0414\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0448]]\n[[pl:Helen Dawlish]]\n[[fr:Helen Dawlish]]\n[[pt-br::Helen Dawlish]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Dawlish family|Helen]]\n[[Category:Duelling Club members]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Gilderoy Lockhart's fans]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
