They were [[Head Boy or Girl]] during the [[1990\u20131991 school year]].<ref name=\"HM71\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n===Hogwarts years {{C|[[1984]]\u2013[[1991]]}}===\nCorey began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1984]] and was Sorted into [[Gryffindor]].<ref name=\"HM71\">{{HM|7|1}}</ref> In their [[third year]], Corey took [[Muggle Studies]] as one of their electives.<ref name=\"HM73\">{{HM|7|3}}</ref> In their [[seventh year]], they were appointed [[Head Boy or Girl]].<ref name=\"HM71\"/>\n\n====Seventh year====\nCorey had an interest in [[History of Magic|magical history]], and at the start of the [[1990\u20131991 school year]], they were seen talking to a crowd about [[Emeric the Evil]] in the [[History of Magic Classroom]]. [[Tulip Karasu]] introduced [[Jacob's sibling]] to them, who despite also being [[Head Boy or Girl]] had never formally met them.<ref name=\"HM71\"/>\n\nLater, when Jacob's sibling wanted to study [[wandless magic]] but couldn't enter the [[Restricted Section]] where all the books about it resided, Corey told them a little bit about it themselves and used the [[Exploding Charm]] in the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]] out of the blue, gaining Jacob's sibling access to the [[Hogwarts kitchens|Kitchens]] for both detention and the opportunity to talk to [[House-elf|house-elves]] who were regular users of wandless magic.<ref name=\"HM72\">{{HM|7|2}}</ref>\n\nAfter the long-anticipated wandless duel between Jacob's sibling and [[Merula Snyde]] took place, Corey revealed they knew something was off with Merula. They later explained that they came to the conclusion by observing Jacob's sibling's behaviour in their interactions with them and Merula. Corey decided they wanted to team up with Jacob's sibling in solving the mystery, so Jacob's sibling told them about Merula's resolve in joining [[R]]. Corey then attended [[Muggle Studies]] class with Jacob's sibling while spying on Merula. During the whole lesson, Merula was taking notes, but at the end turned it into a [[Merula Snyde's letter to Badeea Ali|black quill]] that looked like [[R]]'s, and secretly passed it to [[Ismelda Murk|Ismelda]]. Jacob's sibling then left to follow Ismelda to the [[owlery]]. They later came back and told Corey the letter was about a secret meeting in the [[Artefact Room]].<ref name=\"HM73\">{{HM|7|3}}</ref>\n\nAt night, Corey put on an [[invisibility cloak]] with Jacob's sibling and waited outside the room, during which they talked about ''[[The Detective Files of Conebush and Persimmons]]'' and the lessons they had learnt from it, including that the guilty wasn't necessarily the first suspect. They then saw Merula heading to the Artefact Room with a figure in a black cloak, but before they could get close enough, [[Argus Filch]] stopped them and made them turn around. When Filch was finally gone, they headed to the Artefact Room and caught Merula and [[Badeea Ali]] in it. They explained that Badeea was only Merula's [[Charms (class)|Charms]] tutor and had been secretly helping her due to it being \"humiliating\". The next day, Corey and Jacob's sibling reviewed the information they had so far.<ref name=\"HM73\"/>\n\nWhen Jacob's sibling went back to Hogwarts from the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]], they updated them with their experience of participating in the [[Ministry of Magic student programme|student assignment programme]], including information of the curse on the [[enchanted window]]s (which later turned out to be the [[Atmospheric Charm]]) and the [[Infiltration of the British Ministry of Magic (1990)|infiltration]] by an [[unidentified Metamorphmagus]]. Corey suspected the [[Dark Witch in Knockturn Alley]] to be this Metamorphmagus based on the description of her transformation in the [[1989\u20131990 school year|previous school year]] given by Jacob's sibling.<ref name=\"HM78\">{{HM|7|8}}</ref>\n\nIn the Library, after Jacob's sibling and [[Liz Tuttle]] researched [[Wampus cat]]s for their new assignment, Corey caught Jacob's sibling up with recent investigations.<ref name=\"HM79\">{{HM|7|9}}</ref>\n\nAt some point later, Corey intercepted a note ([[Paper to quill spell|transfigured]] as a quill) from Merula, which said that she wouldn't put her friends in danger again. Jacob's sibling met with Corey in [[Three Broomsticks Inn|Three Broomsticks]] and talked about the [[Garrick Ollivander's stolen wand|phoenix feather wand]] stolen from [[Ollivanders]] and the note Corey intercepted.<ref name=\"HM715\">{{HM|7|15}}</ref>\n\nBefore the [[Wizengamot]] trial of the [[white-robed wizard]], Jacob's sibling spoke to Corey about Merula in the [[Great Hall]]. The two noticed [[Victor Ketsueki]], a [[Ravenclaw]] student in their year, talking to a bunch of students about his experience as a [[vampire]]. They then went to the [[Hogwarts Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]] and found [[R's notes#R's note (XI)|another note]] which warned the receiver not to cross \"us\". It was likely a reply to Merula's note about not putting her friends in danger, suggesting that Merula and R may not have now been completely on the same side. Just as they [[Untransfiguration|Untransfigured]] it back to a black quill, Merula arrived and confronted them, but they fobbed her off and soon left. The two then discussed the note and Merula in the Artefact Room, and thought it would be a good idea to ask Merula to become a double agent. Suddenly, a [[Doxy]] flew out and bit Corey.<ref name=\"HM716\">{{HM|7|16}}</ref>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Corey was skilled with the casting of the [[Exploding Charm]].<ref name=\"HM72\"/>\n*'''[[History of Magic]]''': Corey was interested and knowledgeable in the field of [[magic]]al history.<ref name=\"HM71\"/>\n*'''[[Muggle Studies]]''': Corey took Muggle Studies classes at [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] level, meaning they must have gained an [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] in the subject.<ref name=\"HM73\"/>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Their gender is always the opposite of [[Jacob's sibling]]'s gender, in case the player becomes [[Head Boy or Girl]] too in the [[Head Boys and Girls]] adventure.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Corey Hayden}}\n*{{HM}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hayden, Corey}}\n{{Head boys and prefects}}\n[[ru:\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u0425\u0435\u0439\u0434\u0435\u043d]]\n[[Category:1970s births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Brown-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors Sorted in 1984]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unknown or undetermined gender]]\n[[Category:Special students]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
