He played [[Chaser]] on the Slytherin [[Slytherin Quidditch team|Quidditch team]] from [[1993]] to [[1996]] and was a member of the [[Inquisitorial Squad]]. Montague was heavily built and had large, hairy forearms.<ref name=\"ootp19\">{{OOTP|B|19}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===1993-1994 Quidditch season===\nWhile it is uncertain whether Montague was on the Slytherin Quidditch Team prior, Montague played in the final match between Slytherin and [[Gryffindor]] in [[1994]]. When Gryffindor Chaser [[Katie Bell]] got possession of the [[Quaffle]], Montague flew in front of her, but, instead of taking the ball, he grabbed her head. Although Katie was able to keep from falling off her [[broomstick|broom]], she dropped the Quaffle. [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] scolded Montague and awarded a penalty to Katie.<ref>{{POA|B|15}}</ref>\n\n===1995-1996 Quidditch season===\nAt the beginning of the [[1995\u20131996 school year|1995-1996]] [[Quidditch]] season, Montague was made [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] of the Slytherin Quidditch team,<ref name=\"ootp19\" /> replacing [[Marcus Flint]]. He chose [[Vincent Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle]] to be the team's new [[Beater]]s.<ref name=\"ootp19\" />\n\n===Vanishing Cabinet incident===\n[[File:Dolores Umbridge with the Inquisitorial Squad capturing Cho Chang (HP5).JPG|thumb|The Inquisitorial Squad, which Montague was a member of]]\nMontague joined the [[Inquisitorial Squad]] in April of 1996. During morning break on his first day as a member, he tried to take [[House points]] from [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]], but the twins shoved him into the [[Vanishing Cabinet]] before he could finish speaking.<ref name=\"ootp28\">{{OOTP|B|28}}</ref> While trapped inside, Montague could occasionally hear goings-on at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], as well as at [[Borgin and Burkes]], where the Cabinet's counterpart was located.<ref name=\"hbp27\">{{HBP|B|27}}</ref> He managed to [[Apparition|Apparate]] out the next day, despite never having obtained an [[Apparition (class)|Apparition licence]], but ended up lodged inside a toilet on the fourth floor.<ref name=\"ootp28\" /><ref name=\"hbp27\" />\n\n[[File:MontagueVanishingCabinet.png|thumb|left|[[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] push Montague head-first into the Vanishing Cabinet]]\nThe Apparition nearly proved fatal to Montague.<ref name=\"hbp27\" /> He was left in a disoriented state for weeks afterwards.<ref name=\"ootp30\">{{OOTP|B|30}}</ref> In May, his parents, [[Graham Montague's parents|Mr and Mrs Montague]], came to the school, looking furious.<ref name=\"ootp30\" /> [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] watched the couple arrive, and Hermione suggested that they should tell [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] what had happened to Montague, in case it would help her treat him.<ref name=\"ootp30\" /> However, both Ron and Harry dismissed this idea,<ref name=\"ootp30\" /> so Hermione apparently let the matter drop. Several weeks later, during the [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] exams in June, Harry went to the [[Hospital Wing]], where he saw Madam Pomfrey spoon-feeding a [[Bright blue liquid|vivid blue potion]] to Montague.<ref name=\"ootp30\" />\n\nMontague eventually told his story to others, including [[Draco Malfoy]], who was the only one to reach the conclusion that there was a connection between the Cabinet at Hogwarts and the Cabinet at [[Borgin and Burkes]].<ref name=\"hbp27\" /> This knowledge gave Draco the means to allow [[Death Eaters]] to enter the school the following year.<ref name=\"hbp27\" />\n\n==Physical appearance==\nMontague was described as being large and muscular, even more so than Crabbe and Goyle. He was also described as having hairy arms.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nBeing the [[Captain]] and [[Chaser]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]], he was presumably rather ambitious and determined, being a member of [[Slytherin]]. He was most likely rather mean-spirited, having became a member of the short-lived [[Inquisitorial Squad]], which persecuted [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]] and [[Ravenclaw]] students for petty and spiteful reasons. He once tried to deduct house points from [[Fred and George Weasley]] with ill-intent, which proved to be his downfall considering what they did to him as a result. He also showed poor sportsmanship whilst playing [[Quidditch]], being inclined to commit fouls when he grabbed [[Katie Bell]]'s head during the [[1993\u20131994 school year]] Quidditch season and being penalised by [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] as punishment. \n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Apparition]]''': Montague was capable of apparating, despite not having not received his formal [[Apparition (class)|Apparition licence]], as he somehow managed to apparate out the [[Vanishing Cabinet]] that [[Fred and George Weasley]] shoved and trapped him inside one, quite an impressive [[magic]]al feat. \n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Having been both the [[Captain]] and [[Chaser]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] whilst as a Hogwarts student, Montague was obviously a very accomplished and talented [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player, despite his unsporting behaviour displayed on the Quidditch pitch. \n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Graham\" is from a Scottish surname which was originally derived from an English place name which probably meant \"gravelly homestead\" in Old English. The surname was first taken to Scotland in the 12th century by the Norman baron William de Graham. Montague is also the surname of Romeo in Shakespeare's famous play ''Romeo and Juliet.''\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*This character is known only by his surname in the [[Harry Potter (book series)|Harry Potter books]]. His first name is given in the {{QWC}} video game, making him one of two [[Slytherin]]s named Graham, the other being [[Graham Pritchard]].\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Graham Montague}}\n*{{POA}} {{1st}}\n*{{OOTP}}\n*{{OOTP|F}}\n*{{OOTP|G}} {{Mention}}\n*{{HBP}} {{Mention}}\n*{{HBP|F}}\n*{{PM}}\n*{{QWC}} {{1st ID}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=[[Marcus Flint]]\n|position=[[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] of the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]]\n|years=[[1995\u20131996 school year|1995-1996]]\n|successor=[[Urquhart]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Montague, Graham}}\n\n[[de:Montague]]\n[[es:Graham Montague]]\n[[fr:Montague]]\n[[pl:Graham Montague]]\n[[ru:\u0413\u0440\u044d\u0445\u044d\u043c \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0433\u044e]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Brown-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Chasers]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts Quidditch Captains]]\n[[Category:Inquisitorial Squad]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Montague family]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 20th century]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
