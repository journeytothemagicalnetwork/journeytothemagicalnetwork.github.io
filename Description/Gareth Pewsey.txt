He competed in the school [[Gobstones]] tournament during the [[1996\u20131997 school year]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe meaning of the name \"Gareth\" is unknown. It first appears in this form in Thomas Malory's 15th-century compilation of Arthurian legends ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', in which Gareth was a knight of the Round Table, the brother of Sir Gawain. Malory based the name on Gahariet, which was the name of a similar Arthurian character in French sources. It may ultimately have a Welsh origin, possibly related to gwaredd meaning \"gentleness\".\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*This particular student was only featured in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|PlayStation 2 version]] of {{POA}} and the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|Nintendo DS version]] of {{HBP}}.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{PS2 only}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogwarts Gobstones}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pewsey, Gareth}}\n[[pl:Gareth Pewsey]]\n[[fr:Gareth Pewsey]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Gobstones players]]\n[[Category:Hufflepuffs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
