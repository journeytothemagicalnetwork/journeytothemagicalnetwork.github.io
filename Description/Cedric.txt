In [[1991]], he borrowed a [[quill|writing quill]] from a [[Girl whose quill was taken by Cedric|female Hufflepuff student]].<ref name=\"PSG\">{{PS|G}} - GBA version</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*It is highly likely that this individual is [[Cedric Diggory]], as he would have been in his [[third year]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Cedric\" was invented by Sir Walter Scott for a character in his novel ''Ivanhoe'' (1819). Apparently he based it on the actual name Cerdic, the name of the semi-legendary founder of the kingdom of Wessex in the 6th-century. The meaning of Cerdic is uncertain, but it does not appear to be Old English in origin.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{PS|G}} {{1st Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}__STATICREDIRECT__\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
