[[1978]]/[[1979]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Gryffindor]] student who aspired to become a [[Auror|member]] of the [[Auror Office]]. She attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]].<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>\n\nFay hoped to become an [[Auror]].<ref name=\"HBPG\"/> It is unknown if she fulfilled her dream after graduating from Hogwarts.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nFay Dunbar was born in late [[1978]] or early-to-mid [[1979]], presumably into a [[pure-blood]] or [[half-blood]] family, as she seemed unfamiliar with a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] hairdryer.<ref name=\"Blood\"/> She was also a fan of [[Gobstones]].<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>\n\nAt the age of eleven, Fay was accepted into [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[Scotland]].\n\n===Hogwarts years===\n\n====Fifth year====\nIn her [[fifth year]], Fay sat her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]]s. By this time, she had decided she wished to be a [[Auror|member]] of the [[Auror Office]] and be a [[Dark Wizard]]-catcher. She achieved an [[Exceeds Expectations]] or [[Outstanding]] in [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]], good marks in [[Herbology]], [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] and [[Charms (class)|Charms]] and an [[Outstanding]] in [[Potions (class)|Potions]].<ref name=\"HBPG\">{{HBP|G}}</ref>\n\n====Sixth and seventh years====\n{{Quote|I think one of the girls in my dormitory has a machine for drying her hair.|Fay answering Harry Potter's question|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)}}\nIn her [[sixth year]] or [[seventh year]] in [[1996]], Fay studied hard for her [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test]]s, still wanting to become an Auror. This year, she could often be found in the [[Middle Courtyard]], near the [[Transfiguration department]].<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>\n\nShortly before the [[Christmas holidays]], [[Harry Potter]] was looking for a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] hairdryer for [[Arthur Weasley]], a collector of non-magical artefacts. Fay told him that one of the girls in her dormitory had \"''a machine for drying her hair''\", although it is unknown which girl she was referring to.<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>\n\nThat same year, Fay also played [[Gobstones]] with Harry, who was trying to defeat all the Gobstones players to win the Gobstones Cup.<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nShe was appeared to be academically gifted, talented and aspirational, as she aspired to be an Auror, and she achieved high grades in many subjects for her Ordinary Wizarding Levels, which allowed her to progress to N.E.W.T. level, meaning she was very hard-working as well.<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Fay managed to achieve an [[Exceeds Expectations]] at [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] in [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]], showing her to be clearly very competent in this difficult field of [[magic]].<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>\n*'''[[Herbology]]''': Fay achieved either an Exceeds Expectations or Outstanding in this subject at Ordinary Wizarding Level.<ref name=\"HBPG\"/> \n*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Fay achieved either an Exceeds Expectations or Outstanding in this subject at Ordinary Wizarding Level. She aspired to become an [[Auror]], so it can be presumed she was very skilled and interested in this subject.<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>  \n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Fay achieved either an Exceeds Expectations or Outstanding in [[Charms (class)|Charms]] at Ordinary Wizarding Level.<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>\n*'''[[Potion]]s''': Fay achieved an [[Outstanding]] in [[Potions (class)|Potions]] at Ordinary Wizarding Level, showing her to be highly talented in potion-making.<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>  \n\n==Etymology==\nDerived from Middle English faie meaning \"[[fairy]]\". It appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Arthurian legends in the name of [[Morgan le Fay]]. It has been used as a given name since the 19th century. In some cases it may be used as a short form of Faith,<ref name=\"name\">[http://www.behindthename.com/name/fay/ Behind the name - Fay]</ref> or another spelling for the mythological Irish creature; the Fae.\n\nDunbar means \"castle headland\" and comes from the old barony of Dunbar, now in East Lothian in Scotland. The place name Dunbar itself comes from the Gaelic dun meaning \"fort\" and barr meaning \"summit\". Locality from the town of Dunbar, at the mouth of the Frith of Forth, Scotland, so called from its situation on the rock which at this place projects into the sea.<ref name=\"surname\">[http://surnames.behindthename.com/php/search.php?type=n&terms=dunbar/ Behind the name - Dunbar].</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Fay only appears in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|third]] and [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|sixth]] video games. She does not appear in either the books or films.\n*If Fay participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], and survived, it is possible that she could have joined the [[Auror Office]], along with others such as [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley]] and [[Neville Longbottom]]. However, this is unconfirmed.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Fay Dunbar}}\n*{{POA|G}} {{1st}} {{C|Console versions}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{C|NDS version}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogwarts Gobstones}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dunbar, Fay}}\n\n[[ru:\u0424\u044d\u0439 \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0431\u0430\u0440]]\n[[es:Fay Dunbar]]\n[[fr:Fay Dunbar]]\n[[pl:Fay Dunbar]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Gobstones players]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
