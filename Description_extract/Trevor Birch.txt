He could usually be found at the Clock Tower Courtyard. Unlike most people who thought that Horace Slughorn was a stakeholder, Trevor thought that he was a good teacher. One day he was duelling and beat him. The blow was so powerful that he needed two days recovering in the hospital wing. He was also an admirer of the author Gilderoy Lockhart.\"Trevor\" is from a surname which was originally from a place name meaning \"big village\" from Welsh tref \"village\" and mawr \"large\".Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (First appearance)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS version only)"
