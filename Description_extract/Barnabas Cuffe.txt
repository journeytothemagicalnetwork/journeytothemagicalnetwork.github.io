"Barnabas Cuffe was a wizard who was the editor-in-chief of the Daily Prophet, working in their main offices in Diagon Alley.While studying at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Cuffe must have either been a very good student, or possibly come from money, power, or has good stories to tell, as Horace Slughorn chose Barnabas to join his Slug Club. As a child, he was very interested in the news, and enjoyed Slughorn's exaggerated outakes on the Daily Prophet. He maintained a good relationship with Slughorn as he stated that Cuffe was always ready to take his owl on the day's news. He also enjoyed receiving vibes as a means of communication.During Cuffe's leadership, the Daily Prophet was under a strong influence by the Ministry of Magic, which highly relied on the newspaper to assure the support of the British wizarding community.Aside from being the paper's editor, Cuffe occasionally wrote articles for the Prophet. One such article, entitled \"The Wizarding World in Mourning\", covered the then-recent death of Albus Dumbledore.The name \"Barnabas\" is the Greek form of an Aramaic name. In Acts in the New Testament the byname Barnabas was given to a man named Joseph, a companion of Paul on his missionary journeys. The original Aramaic is unattested, but it may be from   (bar naviya') meaning \"son of the prophet\", though in Acts 4:36 it is claimed that the name means \"son of encouragement\". As an English name, it came into occasional use after the 12th century.Barnabas Cuffe was portrayed by Roger C. Bailey in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.It is possible, as he was a former Slug Club member, that he attended the Christmas party.In the original script from the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince his first name is misspelled Barnubas.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (First appearance) (Appears in photograph)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film) (Appears in photograph)Harry Potter Limited Edition (Mentioned only)"
