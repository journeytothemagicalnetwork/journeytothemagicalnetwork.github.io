"Pamela Alton was a witch and Ravenclaw student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s.She was usually seen spending time on the lower floor of the Clock Tower. She thought highly of Professor Horace Slughorn.Pamela belonged to her house's Duelling Club. One day she duelled Harry Potter and was defeated by him. The blow was so powerful that she spent two days in the Hospital Wing. She was a fan of Gilderoy Lockhart and wrote quite a few letters to him.The name Pamela was invented in the late 16th century by the poet Sir Philip Sidney for use in his poem 'Arcadia'. He possibly intended it to mean \"all sweetness\" from Greek  (pan) \"all\" and  (meli) \"honey\". It was later employed by author Samuel Richardson for the heroine in his novel 'Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded' (1740), after which time it became used as a given name. It did not become popular until the 20th century.This particular student was only featured in the console versions of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Nintendo DS and PSP versions of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (First appearance)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS & PSPS versions only)"
