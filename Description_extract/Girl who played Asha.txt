"This girl attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the early part of the 20th century.She was cast as Asha in the Christmas production of \"The Fountain of Fair Fortune\" that Herbert Beery arranged. An hour before the play started, the boy who played Sir Luckless dumped his girlfriend (who had been cast as Amata) in favour of the one playing Asha, causing the two jealous young witches to duel each other on the stage. Professor Beery was caught in the crossfire, and was unable to stop them or prevent the engorged ashwinder, serving as the gigantic white worm, from setting fire to the Great Hall.The Tales of Beedle the Bard (Mentioned only)"
