"Brennan Doyle was a wizard, who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1980s where he was sorted into Ravenclaw house.Brennan Doyle was born between 1 September 1970 and 31 August 1971. In 1982, he began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was sorted into Ravenclaw. At some point during his time at Hogwarts, Brennan joined the Ravenclaw Quidditch team as a Keeper, but got down to the substitute roster in either 1987 or 1988, when Andre Egwu proved to be a more talented Keeper.In the 19881989 school year, he attacked Andre Egwu with the Conjunctivitis Curse during Quidditch training, wanting to play on the team instead of Andre. This lead to a series of events which resulted in Brennan to be kicked out of the Ravenclaw Quidditch team for his foul play.Flying: Doyle was clearly an accomplished and talented broomstick flyer and Quidditch player, given how he played as Keeper for the Ravenclaw Quidditch team, which must demonstrate he had a high level of skill and experience in the magical sport.Dark Arts: Doyle had some skill with the casting of Dark charms, given how he was able to successfully cast the Conjunctivitis Curse on Andre Egwu in 1989.As Andre's direct predecessor as the Ravenclaw Keeper, he should be on the Ravenclaw team at the very least in the 19871988 school year (as Andre is the Keeper in the following school year), which corresponds to Quidditch Season 3. However, for Ravenclaw players, this role is taken by Jacob's sibling. For non-Ravenclaw players, a player resembling Brennan Doyle can be seen on the Ravenclaw team, but as a Seeker with a different player as the Keeper.Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (First appearance)"
