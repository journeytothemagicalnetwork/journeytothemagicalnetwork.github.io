"Amelia Fittleworth was a witch and Hufflepuff student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s.During the 19961997 school year, she could usually be found in the Owlery, as she liked to watch the owls there (of which Hedwig, the snowy owl owned by Harry Potter, was one of her favourites). Rubeus Hagrid gave her the last of his rose oil for an unknown reason, but as Harry Potter needed it to give to Ron Weasley, she agreed to trade it with him for four Fanged Frisbees.She presumably came from either a pure-blood or half-blood background, as she initially had no idea what a hairdryer was, and upon learning what it did, expressed the opinion, \"Muggles have so many strange things.\"The name \"Amelia\" is a variant of Amalia, though it is sometimes confused with Emilia, which has a different origin. The name became popular in England after the German House of Hanover came to the British throne in the 18th century - it was borne by daughters of George II and George III. Another famous bearer was Amelia Earhart (18971937), the first woman to make a solo flight over the Atlantic Ocean.This particular student was only featured in the home console versions of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the mobile and Nintendo DS versions of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (First appearance) (Console versions only)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (Mobile and Nintendo DS versions only)"
