"Poonima Shah was a Slytherin student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s. She was seen walking around the school during the 1993-1994 school year.Poonima means 'full moon' in Sanskrit. The Indian surname \"Shah\" is mistakenly thought that it is derived from the Persian \"Shah\" meaning \"King\". It is derived from Sanskrit Sadhu (meaning gentleman) and Prakrit Sahu, while the actual spelling \"Shah\" in Western culture was popularised by the title of the former Persian King. In the Gujarat and Rajasthan region, the surname Shah derives from the varnacular sah (from Sanskrit Sadhu, \"merchant\"). This student was only featured in the PlayStation 2 version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.Based on her name, it can be presumed that she is of Indian descent.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (PS2 version only)"
