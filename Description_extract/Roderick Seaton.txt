"Roderick Seaton was a wizard and Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s. He was usually seen spending time at the Library during the 19961997 school year. He was a Gobstones player, and was one of the challengers Harry Potter had to beat in order to win the Gobstones Cup that year.The name \"Roderick\" means \"famous power\" from the Germanic elements hrod \"fame\" and ric \"power\". This name was in use among the Visigoths; it was borne by their last king (also known as Rodrigo), who died fighting the Muslim invaders of Spain in the 8th century. It also had cognates in Old Norse and West Germanic, and it was introduced to England by Scandinavian settlers and the Normans, though it died out after the Middle Ages. It was revived in the English-speaking world by Sir Walter Scott's poem The Vision of Don Roderick (1811).This particular student was only featured in the console versions of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Nintendo DS version of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (First appearance) (Console versions only)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS version only)"
