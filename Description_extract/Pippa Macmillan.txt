"Pippa Macmillan was a witch who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1983 and was Sorted into Gryffindor.During her second year at Hogwarts, Pippa could be seen sitting with Ismelda Murk by the fountain in the Courtyard.In her third year, during a full moon in late September or October, she was attacked by a white creature in the Forbidden Forest, thinking that it was a Werewolf. She reported to Madam Pomfrey, who treated her in the Hospital Wing. Using a Memory Potion with the help of Chiara Lobosca and Jacob's sibling, she found out that the creature was actually a Hippogriff and that she had been scratched by a tree branch in the process of fleeing from it.Pippa's physical appearance is one of the often-seen NPCs in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery.Despite the fact that other dialogue in the \"Chiara\" Achievement is year adjusted, Pippa is still stated to be a third year regardless of the player's year.She is a possible relative of Ernest Macmillan.Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (First appearance)"
