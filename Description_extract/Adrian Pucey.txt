"Adrian Pucey (born c. 19771979) was a wizard who likely began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1989 or 1990. He was a member of Slytherin house, and was a Chaser on the Slytherin Quidditch team. Marcus, Adrian and Draco before a Quidditch Match Adrian Pucey likely began attending Hogwarts School in 1989 or 1990. He was sorted into the house of Slytherin and made it onto the Slytherin Quidditch team and he played the role of Chaser.Adrian was on the Slytherin team in Harry Potter's first year up to and including his fifth year (except for the third year, when Marcus Flint, Cassius Warrington and Graham Montague are said to be the three chasers); hence, he was no more than two years ahead of Harry, assuming that he did not need to repeat a year, like Marcus Flint. He was notable for being one of the few Slytherin Quidditch players who was not seen to commit a foul or otherwise cheat, despite being on the Quidditch team for at least three years.Adrian Pucey was played by Scot Fearn in the first two films, but due to a series of errors in the closing credits of Philosopher's Stone, he was listed as having played Terence Higgs (his name was additionally misspelled as \"Scott Fern\" therein), while David Holmes was wrongly credited as Pucey and Will Theakston (Higgs) as Marcus Flint. These errors were corrected in Chamber of Secrets, though both Fearn's and Jamie Yeates' names contained spelling errors.The name Adrian is derived from the Roman name Hadrian, who was an emperor of Rome who gave his name to Hadrian's Wall in England. Adrian means \"from Adria\", a port on the Adriatic Sea, and was the regnal name of the first and only English pope, Adrian IV.Pucey may be from puce, a deep red to dark greyish purple, and from the French word for \"flea\".Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (First appearance)Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)Harry Potter and the Prisoner of AzkabanHarry Potter and the Order of the PhoenixPottermore (Mentioned only)Harry Potter: Quidditch World CupHarry Potter: The Character Vault"
