"Winky Crockett (also spelled Crocket) was a wizard or witch who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s, and was a member of Gryffindor house.Winky's name was included on a list of students with overdue library books that was put up on the bulletin board in the Gryffindor common room by Madam Pince sometime in the 1990s.Winky personally signed up to join the Hogwarts Gobstone Club on a sign-up sheet posted on the Gryffindor noticeboard. Winky also registered for a trip to Hogsmeade on another sign-up sheet posted on the Gryffindor bulletin board, which was scheduled for Saturday the 15th in an unknown month.This character is mentioned only on two prop notices that have been featured in at least one Harry Potter film. On the first notice, their name was spelled \"Winky Crocket,\" and on the the second, it was was spelled \"Winky Crockett.\" However, since both instances of the name are from the same house and time frame, they can be assumed to refer to the same person, with one presumably being a misspelling.The name of this character is a tribute to Jordan Crockett, who worked as an art department production assistant on the first two Harry Potter films, and as a draughtsman on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.The first name 'Winky' is most likely a nod to the character from the books. She was a House-Elf that was cut from the films.Harry Potter films (Mentioned on a poster)"
