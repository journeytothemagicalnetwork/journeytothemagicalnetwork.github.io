He was quite a talented wizard, but was considered something of an eccentric, as he liked to communicate by puffing smoke from the tip of his wand. Eventually, he was forced out of office in 1925 due to irritation at his eccentricities.The Daily Prophet reported in its 29 November 1926 issue that Ravenclaw students were planning to honour McLaird.Luna Lovegood may have named her son  Lorcan  after this man, probably in admiration for his eccentricity.Calvin Coolidge, the thirtieth President of the United States, was also known for being incredibly taciturn. He, too, came into office in 1923.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film) (Mentioned in a newspaper)Pottermore (Mentioned only)Wizarding World (Mentioned only)"
