"Morag MacDougal was a witch who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991. She was in the same year as Harry Potter.She was the witch who Neville Longbottom had to give the Sorting Hat back to when he accidentally ran off with it after being sorted.As Isobel MacDougal never appears in the Harry Potter novels, it is possible that she is the same character as Morag, having been renamed at some point without J. K. Rowling noting the change on her handwritten list of the forty original students in Harry's year.A student named Morag appeared in the PC version of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game). She worked with matches in Professor McGonagall's transfiguration class. It is possible that this is Morag MacDougal, who may have repeated her first year. (Match to needle is a spell known to be covered in first year transfiguration classes.)Morag is from Gaelic m\\xf3r, \"tall.\" Dougall is from the Gaelic Dubhgall, or \"dark stranger,\" and \"Mac\" is \"son of.\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (First appearance)Harry Potter and Me (Mentioned only)"
