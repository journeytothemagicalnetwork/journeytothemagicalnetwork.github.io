"Michael McManus was a Beater on the Hufflepuff Quidditch team in the 19931994 school year. He played in the match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff.The name \"Michael\" comes from the Hebrew name  (Mikha'el) meaning \"who is like God?\". This is a rhetorical question, implying no person is like God. Saint Michael was one of the seven archangels in Hebrew tradition and the only one identified as an archangel in the Bible.This character only appears in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Portrayed by Lewis Barnshaw, he is seen briefly, during the match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff. His name is not given in the film, but was revealed in an interview with Lewis in The Stage, a British theatre magazine.Michael's presence as a Beater on the Hufflepuff team while it was captained by Cedric Diggory conflicts with the player roster from the video game Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup. In this game, Hufflepuff's Beaters are Anthony Rickett and Maxine O'Flaherty, but it is possible that Michael was a reserve team member, who played in the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff match only because Anthony or Maxine was unable to do so. Alternatively, Anthony and/or Maxine may have been on the team in the 19921993 school year, but not during the following term. However, Cedric Diggory is not known to have been captain before 1993-1994.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)"
