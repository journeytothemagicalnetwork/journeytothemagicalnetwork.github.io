"Richard Sky was a Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He once signed up for Quidditch training at 7pm on Thursday on a sign-up sheet that was posted on the bulletin board in the Gryffindor Common Room.The name \"Richard\" means \"brave power\", derived from the Germanic elements ric \"power, rule\" and hard \"brave, hardy\". The Normans introduced this name to Britain, and it has been very common there since that time. It was borne by three kings of England including Richard I the Lionheart, leader of the Third Crusade in the 12th century.The Wizarding World of Harry Potter (Mentioned on a poster)"
