"Sage Bragnam was a Scottish wizard and a magical historian specialising in examining artefacts and runes; he worked in the capacity of Head Curator of the Department of Magical Artefacts at the British Ministry of Magic.He assisted the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures with expert opinion during their investigations related to magical beasts.Born into a family of unverified magical pedigree, Sage Bragham was born in Scotland and attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during his formative years where he was sorted into Ravenclaw House. He was a good student, and took a particular interest in more theoretical studies, such as History of Magic and the Study of Ancient Runes, both of which he would later specialise in as an adult. He was also known to have studied Arithmancy.In adulthood, Sage became an accomplished magical historian, specialising in examining magical artefacts and the interpretation of runes. Eventually, he found employment at the British Ministry of Magic, where he was hired by the Ministry's research wing and assigned to the Department of Magical Artefacts, where he would eventually rise to the position of Head Curator. Due to his knowledge on magical creatures, he would also occasionally be called on to assist with the investigations into creature-related incidents by the Beast Division in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Having held onto his old house tie, at some point, he placed it in his office. An avid Quidditch fan, he was a strong supporter of the English team Tutshill Tornados, owning a souvenir programme signed by no less a person than the famed seeker Roderick Plumpton himself. He eventually also found himself becoming a slightly reclusive activist in the Witches' Holistic Institute for Friends of Fairies, of which only he and Winifred Whittle were members.Sometime later, a research assistant at the Auror Office by the name of Grim Fawley greatly ran through and successfully transcribed an ancient tome that had, until that moment, proven too difficult to translate. Greatly impressed by the man's skill in rune translation and ancient languages, Mr. Bragnam, who decided that he were being wasted with the Aurors, tried to have him transferred to his own department; only to learn, to his dismay, that his wife had already persuaded him to pursue a career as an Unspeakable in the Department of Mysteries. After five prominent members of the magical community in Great Britain went mysteriously missing in 2015, Mr. Bragnam lent his expertise to the efforts being made to find them by joining the council that oversaw the search lead by the Head of the Auror Office, Harry Potter.. After several months without any results, even after the lead Auror on the case had even borrowed creatures from the Magizoologist Mathilda Grimblehawk in the Beast Division, the Ministry came under a lot of pressure to find them. Still and all, it would take at least a couple of years before the Ministry decided to hold a Public Hearing to discuss a motion to terminate the London Five investigation; during which Grim Fawley, the husband of one of the missing individuals; made a stirring speech where he urged the Ministry to keep the investigation open. By then, however, the whole investigation became a very involved and political affair, and after the Aurors failed to come up with any evidence regarding their whereabouts, the council finally determined that it was time to close the investigation, with Sage himself later noting that there was numerous unseen reason behind the decision.Sage had short reddish-brown hair with a fairly large bushy beard, with brown eyes and white skin. He often wore a brightly coloured striped scarf with a beige coat.Sage was a fairly sociable individual, and was friendly with many of his colleagues and co-workers, such as Mathilda Grimblehawk and her partner, and was always happy to help them if called upon to do so, having more than once been called in for consultation by the Beast Division during investigations into creature-related incidents, once even agreeing to go through the entire accounts ledger from Slug & Jiggers Apothecary in Diagon Alley for them. He had a very dry sense of humour, being amused by bad puns relating to the objects he was called in to examine and proved himself to be open-minded, as seen by how, rather than being prejudiced against non-wizards, on the contrary was rather fascinated by the creative ingenuity of Muggles. A compassionate man, he proved himself to have a vested interest in the well-being of his peers, telling Grimblehawk to be careful while she was looking for dangerous creatures. He was also a man of action, at least to the extent where he was wiling to go to great lengths to help bring a resolution to catastrophe, as shown when he joined the council tasked with overseeing the investigation into the London Five.History of Magic: An authority in History of Magic, Sage was often called upon to use his expertise to help shred light on obscure findings during the investigations during his time in working with Mathilda Grimblehawk.Study of Ancient Runes: Specialising on the study and examination of runes, Sage was very well versed and knowledgeable in the study of Runology, and hence often called upon to able to interpret or translate complex runic scriptures, alphabets and symbols found in the field during investigations.Magizoology: According to Magizoologist Mathilda Grimblehawk, Sage possessed a \"profound\" knowledge on magical creatures, and was often called upon to examine everything from claw marks to bits and bobs of magical creatures found during the course of the investigations of the Beast Division, and once successfully identified a feather retrieved from such a scene as that of a Golden Eagle rather than a magical creature.Healing magic: Sage was also proficient with medical spells and brews, as he was sometimes set to not only examine the creatures brought back to the Ministry in the wake of beast-related investigations, but also treated their injuries and saw to it that they were relocated somewhere on a safe distance from Muggles afterwards.Arithmancy: A former student of the subject at Hogwarts and a professional Arithmancer in his adult life, he was known to have utilise his knowledge and expertise in the field to figure out number-related conundrums, such as the accounts ledger from Slug & Jiggers Apothecary.Knowledge of Magical Law: Sage was able to ascertain that nothing Bilius Finbok had purchased from Slug & Jiggers Apothecary was illegal or could be used to make something illegal, showing he had a strong understanding of Magical Law and the various applications it cut across the Wizarding world and with Wizardkind.Fantastic Beasts: Cases from the Wizarding World (First appearance)Harry Potter: Wizards Unite"
