"Michael was a wizard and Gryffindor student who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the 1990s. Fred and George comfort Michael in 1996 Michael started his education at Hogwarts in the mid-1990s. Upon arriving at Hogwarts, Michael was sorted into Gryffindor house.During the 19951996 school year, Fred and George Weasley comforted him after Dolores Umbridge made him use a blood quill to write lines after he was caught pulling a rebellious prank on Umbridge, telling him that his wounds were already healing, and that the pain would eventually go away. Shortly after this, he was joined by Harry Potter in the courtyard when Umbridge turned up, because it was then that the Weasley twins decided to put their plan of escape into action, a plan that Michael witnessed and supported.The name Michael comes from the Hebrew Mikha-el, meaning \"Who is like God?\"Michael has only appeared in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. There was no mention about him in the book.Michael may have been a member of Dumbledore's Army to have served detention using the Blood Quill in the film adaptation, as all members listed on Dumbledore's Army's parchment were punished as a group. There were, however, multiple other reasons to serve detention, seeing as in the film adaptation Umbridge and the Ministry passed at least one-hundred and thirty-six Educational Decrees.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film) (First appearance)"
