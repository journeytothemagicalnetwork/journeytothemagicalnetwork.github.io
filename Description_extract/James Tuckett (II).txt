"James Tuckett (born c. 1984-1985) was a wizard who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1996 and was sorted into Hufflepuff House.In his first year, he caught Draco Malfoy trying to steal the birds in the seventh-floor corridor, but was too frightened to tell anyone about it due to being intimidated by Draco and his friends. Harry Potter gave him some Cauldron Cakes and afterwards he felt good enough to tell Harry what he knew. James also played informal Quidditch matches with other students during his first year.The name \"James\" is the English form of the Late Latin name Iacobus which was derived from  (Iakobos), the New Testament Greek form of the Hebrew name Ya'aqov.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (First appearance) (Nintendo DS version only)"
