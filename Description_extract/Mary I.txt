"Mary I (18 February, 1516  17 November, 1558), also known by her sobriquet of \"Bloody Mary\", was Queen of England and Ireland from July 1553 until her death on 17 November, 1558.Queen Mary was a witch and had a wand of her own. There was a portrait of her hung at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.She was a daughter of the Muggle king Henry VIII and his first wife Catherine of Aragon and thus a half-sister to her successor, Elizabeth I.The name \"Mary\" is the usual English form of Maria, which was the Latin form of the New Testament Greek names  (Mariam) and  (Maria) - the spellings are interchangeable - which were from the Hebrew name  (Miryam). The meaning is not known for certain, but there are several theories including \"sea of bitterness\", \"rebelliousness\", and \"wished for child\". However it was most likely originally an Egyptian name, perhaps derived in part from mry \"beloved\" or mr \"love\".Harry Potter films (Appears in portrait(s))The Wizarding World of Harry Potter (Appears in portrait(s))The Making of Harry Potter (Appears in portrait(s))"
