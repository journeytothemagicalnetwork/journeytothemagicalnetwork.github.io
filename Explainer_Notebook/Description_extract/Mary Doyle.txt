"Mary Doyle was a Gryffindor student who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1990 or 1991.She competed in the school Wizard Skittles tournament during the 19961997 school year.The name \"Mary\" is the English form of Maria, which was the Latin form of the New Testament Greek names  (Mariam) and  (Maria) - the spellings are interchangeable - which were from the Hebrew name  (Miryam). The meaning is not known for certain, but there are several theories including \"sea of bitterness\", \"rebelliousness\", and \"wished for child\". However it was most likely originally an Egyptian name, perhaps derived in part from mry \"beloved\" or mr \"love\".Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (PS2 version only)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS version only)"
