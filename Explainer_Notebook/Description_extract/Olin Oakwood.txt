"Olin Oakwood was a wizard who founded the Hippogriff Club at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the 1800s.Olin was in a study group with Margaretta Ironbark and Skylar Flame. He was best friends with Ironbark. He was reluctant to compete in the Trials, but was pressured into it by Ironbark and Flame. After he defeated them and won the tournament, their study group fell apart and each of them formed their own clubs, each one dedicated to the areas of study that suited them best.At some point, he wrote a journal that detailed the ground rules for his competition with Margaretta Ironbark and Skylar Flame. Because of Olin, Ironbark and Flame becoming grudging enemies due to their competition, the professors decided to put his journal at the bottom of the lagoon in the Hippogriff Clubhouse, hoping that the clubs' animosity would fade over time.Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (First appearance) (Appears in portrait(s))"
