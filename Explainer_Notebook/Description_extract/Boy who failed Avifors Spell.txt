"This boy was a wizard who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry sometime in or before the early 1990s. Once during his first year during Transfiguration he used the Avifors Spell but was only able to turn things into eggs. He later tried to practise during breakfast and became very popular because of his failed attempts.Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) (First mentioned) (GBC version)"
