"M. G. McGonagall was a Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the early 1970s. They played on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, winning an award for it in 1971, which was displayed at Hogwarts on a plaque that also bore the names of James Potter and R. J. H. King.McGonagall may have been related to Transfiguration teacher Minerva McGonagall. It is possible that M. G. McGonagall is one of her nephews or nieces from her two brothers, Robert Jnr and Malcolm.The name M. G. McGonagall appears only in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. M. G. McGonagall cannot have been the same person as Minerva McGonagall, as Minerva was already a teacher at Hogwarts by 1910. It also can't be any of her siblings, who Minerva helped her mother in covering up magical accidents from their father already during her pre-Hogwarts years. It presumably is one of the nieces or nephews of Minerva's, and as such, the child of either Malcolm or Robert.In the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, a trophy can be found in the Trophy Room near the Great Hall. Inspecting it causes Ronald Weasley to comment on the presence of Minerva McGonagall's name near James Potter's, to which Harry Potter speculates that it may have been due to her being Head of Gryffindor House at the time. However, these two awards cannot be considered the same, as the one seen in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a plaque, and not a cup.Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) (Name appears on trophy)Pottermore (Possible appearance)"
