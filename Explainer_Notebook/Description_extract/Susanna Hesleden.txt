"Susanna Hesleden was a Ravenclaw student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s. Susanna was a fan of Gilderoy Lockhart, and was known to send him letters daily.The name \"Susanna\" is from  (Sousanna), the Greek form of the Hebrew name  (Shoshannah). This was derived from the Hebrew word  (shoshan) meaning \"lily\" (in modern Hebrew this also means \"rose\"), perhaps ultimately from Egyptian sn \"lotus\".This particular student was only featured in the PlayStation 2 version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Nintendo DS version of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (PS2 version only)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS version only)"
