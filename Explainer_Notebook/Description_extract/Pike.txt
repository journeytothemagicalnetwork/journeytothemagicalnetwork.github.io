"Pike (b. 1979-1980) was a wizard who attended Hogwarts in the 1990s and was Sorted into Slytherin house. He was commonly seen between 1993 and 1994 with Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe, and Gregory Goyle. Pike in Hogsmeade near the Shrieking Shack Pike began his education at Hogwarts at some point, and was sorted into Slytherin house.He was part of Draco Malfoy's gang during the 19931994 school year and was one of the Slytherins that cruelly imitated a Dementor in an effort to scare Harry Potter in the first Care of Magical Creatures class of the year. He was also with Malfoy in the Stone Circle when Malfoy was punched by Hermione Granger in 1994.Pike was portrayed by Bronson Webb in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.Before his name was revealed, many fans assumed this individual was Theodore Nott. Pike is somewhat similar in appearance to the way Nott is described in the novels. The difference however is that Pike is shown to be a member of Draco's gang while Nott is only loosely associated with the gang.It is possible that Pike was created specifically to replace Gregory Goyle in certain action-oriented scenes as Josh Herdman had injured his arm and would have been unable to perform them. For instance, Pike replaces Goyle in the scene where Malfoy and his gang harass Ron and Hermione outside the Shrieking Shack.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) (First appearance)"
