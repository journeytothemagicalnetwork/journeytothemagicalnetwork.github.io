"Theodore was a wizard who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 21st century and was sorted into Ravenclaw. A student would frequently encounter him in the Forbidden Forest.The player character appears to already know who Theodore is when they meet him in the Forbidden Forest, despite there having been no appearance or mention of him in the main storyline, which might suggest that Theodore is a character cut from the storyline, or he might appear later in currently unreleased school years.Harry Potter: Magic Awakened (First appearance)"
