"Ignatia Wildsmith (12271320) was a witch and wizarding inventor, who was famously the creator of Floo Powder. During her childhood, she attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and was sorted into Ravenclaw.Ignatia Wildsmith was born in 1227, somewhere in the British Isles.In her youth, she attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from around 1238 or 1239 to 1245 or 1246, where she was sorted into Ravenclaw. A younger Ignatia Wildsmith After her graduation from Hogwarts School, Ms. Wildsmith presumably studied further into Herbology, and discovered the magical properties of the Floo plant. From it, she devised a magical powder, Floo Powder, which, when thrown into a fire, could transport wizards from one fireplace to another via a network of fireplaces.Ms. Wildsmith died in 1320, aged around 93. In her honour, her achievement, the invention of the Floo Powder, was recorded on a Chocolate Frog Card.On 1 September, 1991, Prefect Robert Hilliard welcomed the Ravenclaw first years to Ravenclaw Tower with a short speech in which he mentioned inventor Ignatia Wildsmith as one of the many notable Hogwarts students who had been Sorted, like them, into Ravenclaw.\"Ignis\" is Latin for \"fire\".On her Famous Wizard Card, Ignatia's outfit bears a resemblance to Maleficent from Disney's Sleeping Beauty. Throughout the film, Maleficent is associated with green flames, even using them to teleport herself. She also has a raven companion, though this may be coincidental, as Ignatia was not revealed to be a Ravenclaw at the time the card was designed.
