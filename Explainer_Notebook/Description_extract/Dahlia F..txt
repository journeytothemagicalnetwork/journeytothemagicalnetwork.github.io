"Dahlia F. was a witch who apparently worked as an opera singer. In her childhood, she attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and was singled out for membership in the Slug Club. Horace Slughorn kept a picture of her in a Viking maiden costume on his shelf, which she had inscribed, \"Best wishes.\"Based on her signature, her surname appears to begin with the letters Fl-, followed by either an -a- or an -e-. The very last part of the name is Peri.It is possible that her name is Dahlia Fleur-Peri.It is possible, as a former Slug Club member, that she attended the Christmas party in 1996.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film) (Appears in photographs)"
