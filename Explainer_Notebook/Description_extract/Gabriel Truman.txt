"Gabriel Truman (born c. 1975) was a wizard and a Hufflepuff student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in his youth. In the early 1990s, he was one of the school's prefects, and dutifully welcomed Hufflepuff first years to Hufflepuff Basement with a short speech. Gabriel Truman was born sometime between 1973 and 1976, somewhere in the British Isles.He began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry sometime between 1985 and 1987, where he was Sorted into Hufflepuff House.In his third year, he landed in trouble by getting into a duel with a Ravenclaw prefect who argued that the famous Arithmancer Bridget Wenlock must have been in his own house, not Hufflepuff, as she was in fact. Gabriel felt he deserved a week's worth of detentions for his own actions, but Professor Sprout went easy on him, sending him off with a warning and a box of coconut ice.By the 1991-1992 school year, Gabriel had been made a prefect himself and, after the Start-of-Term Feast on 1 September, 1991, welcomed the Hufflepuff first years as they arrived at Hufflepuff Basement with a short speech about the House traditions, symbols, characteristics, and famous past students.
