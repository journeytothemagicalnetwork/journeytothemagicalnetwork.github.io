"Terrence Fogarty was a wizard and Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s. He was usually seen spending time by the Viaduct with Thomas Paley during the 1996-1997 school year. He confessed to Harry Potter that he would like a new broom. He also admits he was a disaster in Potions.The name \"Terrence\" is from the Roman family name Terentius which is of unknown meaning. Famous bearers include Publius Terentius Afer, a Roman playwright, and Marcus Terentius Varro, a Roman scholar. It was also borne by several early saints. The name was used in Ireland as an anglicised form of Toirdhealbhack, but it was not in use as an English name until the late 19th century.This particular student was only featured in the console versions of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Nintendo DS version of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (Console versions)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS version only)"
