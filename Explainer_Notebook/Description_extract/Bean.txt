At some point before or during the 19851986 school year, she became a Beater on her House Quidditch team.She talked to her bat after Quidditch matches as her lucky tradition.She was extremely dedicated to her position as a Beater to the point where she neglected her studies and had not attended any lessons after her second house match in the 19851986 school year. As a result, during the 19861987 school year, she was suspended from her Quidditch team for the season and her position was filled by Jacob's sibling. After the school year, she had improved her grades to the point that her suspension was lifted and she returned to play the position for at least the next season.Her house is the same as that of Jacob's sibling, which is chosen by the player.Bean is a fan of Erika Rath.Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (First appearance)"
