"Isobel MacDougal was a pure-blood witch who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991. She was sorted into the Ravenclaw house.The existence of this character cannot be considered canon. In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the Sorting ceremony proceeds alphabetically, and Neville Longbottom is immediately followed by Morag MacDougal.As revealed by J. K. Rowling on Pottermore, this character was originally named \"Katrina\", but this was crossed out on her hand-written list of the forty students in Harry's year and replaced with \"Isobel\".As an Isobel McDougal was never featured in a published book in the series, but a Morag MacDougal was, it is possible that the two are siblings (given the shared last name), though it is debated if the two are independent characters or if Isobel was simply renamed Morag.\"Dougall\" is from the Gaelic Dubhgall, or \"dark stranger,\" and \"Mac\" is \"son of.\"Harry Potter and Me (First mentioned)Pottermore (Mentioned only)Wizarding World (Mentioned only)"
