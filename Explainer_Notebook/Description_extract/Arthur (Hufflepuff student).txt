"Arthur was an eccentric wizard and Hufflepuff student who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1992. He was the younger brother of Marilyn and collected beetle pincers like his sister, although he raved that his collection was much better than hers. He also owned a \"smashing\" collection of non-magical cricket balls.Arthur and his sister were both described by other students as \"a bit off.\"The meaning of the name Arthur is unknown. It could be derived from British art \"bear\" combined with viros \"man\", or it could be related to Irish art \"stone\". Alternatively it could be related to an obscure Roman family name Artorius. Arthur is the name of the central character in Arthurian legend, a 6th-century king of the Britons who presided over the knights of the Round Table.While Arthur appears to be of African descent, Marilyn is Caucasian and blonde.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) (First appearance) (PC version)"
