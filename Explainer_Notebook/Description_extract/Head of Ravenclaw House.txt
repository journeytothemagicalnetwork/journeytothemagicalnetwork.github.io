"The Head of Ravenclaw was a Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who was in charge of looking after and disciplining the students of their house, Ravenclaw. The Head of House also served as a Professor of a subject, presumably an academic subject for a Head of Ravenclaw. Most, if not all, of the heads of Ravenclaw house attended Hogwarts and were sorted into Ravenclaw during their attendance at the school, such as Filius Flitwick. It is unknown how a professor would be elected to the post, but it was possible that the headmaster chose a professor who embodied the qualities of house founder Rowena Ravenclaw, such as intelligence, wisdom, and wit.The first Head of Ravenclaw House was the famous co-founder of Hogwarts, Rowena Ravenclaw; the only other known Head of House was Filius Flitwick.Rowena Ravenclaw - One of the four Hogwarts founders and founder of the Ravenclaw House.Filius Flitwick - Head of Ravenclaw during Harry Potter's time at Hogwarts.Head of Gryffindor HouseHead of Hufflepuff HouseHead of Slytherin HouseRavenclawProfessorHogwarts subjectsHogwartsHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (First appearance)Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)Harry Potter and the Prisoner of AzkabanHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)Harry Potter and the Goblet of FireHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)Harry Potter and the Order of the PhoenixHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood PrinceHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)Harry Potter and the Deathly HallowsHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (video game)LEGO Harry Potter: Building the Magical WorldLEGO Harry Potter: Characters of the Magical WorldHarry Potter: Quidditch World CupLEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7Harry Potter for KinectLEGO Harry PotterPottermoreWizarding WorldHarry Potter Trading Card GameThe Making of Harry PotterHarry Potter: The Character VaultHarry Potter: The Creature Vault (Mentioned only)Harry Potter: Hogwarts MysteryHarry Potter: Wizards UniteHarry Potter: Puzzles & Spells"
