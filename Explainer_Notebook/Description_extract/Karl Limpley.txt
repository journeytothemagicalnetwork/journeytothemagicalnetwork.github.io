"Karl Limpley was a British wizard who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s, who was a member of Hufflepuff house.On the Hogwarts Express in 1996, he agreed to trade Harry Potter an issue of Which Broomstick? for three Chocolate Frog Cards, as Harry needed a magazine to give to Jason Huntingdon for a pair of Spectrespecs. Karl said he thought Jason might be \"making some kind of fashion statement\" by wearing Spectespecs, and that he would never wear the glasses himself, even though they're free. Later in the year, he ran a Duelling Club in the Clock Tower Courtyard, which included Irfan Mustaq and Neil Randall as members.The name \"Karl\" is the German and Scandinavian form of Charles. This was the name of seven emperors of Austria. Other famous bearers include Karl Marx (1818-1883), the German philosopher and revolutionary who laid the foundations for communism, and Karl Jaspers (1883-1969), a German existentialist philosopher.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (First appearance)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS and PSP version only)"
