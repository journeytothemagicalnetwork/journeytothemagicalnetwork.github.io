"Alys (born c. 1984-1985) was a witch who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1996 and was Sorted into Hufflepuff House.In her first year, she was taught Potions by the Potions Master, Professor Horace Slughorn. As Alys was clearing up her things with the other students, Slughorn called to her, and reminded her to take the rat tail she had left behind on the desk.The Welsh name \"Alys\" is probably directly rooted in the name Alice, which is rooted in the Old German name Adelaide (or, directly, Adelheidis), meaning, 'Nobility\".The character Alys has only appeared in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince to date, and does not make any appearance in the books.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film) (First appearance)"
