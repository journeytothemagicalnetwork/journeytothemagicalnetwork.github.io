"Jessica Tring was a witch and Hufflepuff student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s. During the 19961997 school year, she could usually be found in the Transfiguration Courtyard, and liked to play Gobstones with other students.The name \"Jessica\" was first used in this form by Shakespeare in his play The Merchant of Venice (1596), where it belongs to the daughter of Shylock. Shakespeare probably based it on the biblical name Iscah which would have been spelled Jescha in his time.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (First appearance) (Console versions)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS version only)"
