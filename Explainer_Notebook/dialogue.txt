I should've known you would have been here Professor McGonagall. Good evening Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumors true Albus? I'm afraid so Professor. The good and the bad. And the boy? Hagrid is bringing him. Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this? Ah, Prof. I would trust Hagrid with my life Professor. Dumbledore, sir. Professor McGonagall. No problems I trust Hagrid? No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep as we were flying over Bristol. Try not to wake him. There you go. Albus, do really think it's safe leaving him with these people? I've watched them all day. There're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are- The only family he has. This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name. Exactly. He's far better off growing up away from all of that. Until he is ready. There, there Hagrid. It's not really goodbye after all. Good Luck, Harry Potter. Up. Get up! Now! Wake up cousin! We're going to the zoo! Here he comes the birthday boy! happy birthday son. Why don't you just cook the breakfast and try not to burn anything. Yes Aunt Petunia. I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day! Hurry up! Bring my coffee boy! yes Uncle Vernon. Aren't they wonderful darling? How many are there? 36, Counted them myself. 36?! BUT LAST YEAR LAST YEAR I HAD 37!!! Yes, but some of them are a bit bigger than last year's! I don't care how big they are! Now, now, now, this is what we're going to do. Is that when we go out we're going to buy you 2 new presents. How's that pumpkin? It should be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it. I'm warning you now boy. Any funny business, any at all and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in. Make it move. Move. MOVE! He's asleep. He's boring. Sorry about him he doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day watching people press their ugly faces in on you. Can you hear me? It's just I've never talked to a snake before. Do you... Do you talk to people often? You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there? Did you miss your family? I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents either. Mummy, Dad, come here you won't believe what this snake is doing! Woah! Woah! Ah! Thanks. Any time. Snake! Ahh! Mum! Mummy! Help me! My darling boy! How did you get in there! Who did this? How did you get in there? Is there a snake? It's all right sweetheart. We'll get you out of these terrible clothes. What happened? I swear, I don't know! One minute the glass was there then it was gone, it was like magic! There's no such thing as magic. Oh Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk. Dad! Look! Harry's got a letter! Hey give it back! It's mine! Yours? Who'd be writing to you? No more mail through this letterbox. Have a lovely day at the office, dear. Shoo! Go on! Fine day Sunday. In my opinion best day of the week. And why is that Dudley? Because there's no post on Sundays. Right you are Harry. No post on Sunday. Ha! No blasted letters today! No, sir! Not one single bloody letter! Not one! No sir, not one blasted, miserable- Make it stop, please! Stop it! Mummy what's happening? Give me that! Give me that letter! Get off! They're my letters! Let go of me! That's it! We're going away, far away! Where they can't find us! Daddy's gone mad hasn't he? Make a wish, Harry. Who's there? Sorry 'bout that. I demand that you leave at once. You are breaking and entering. Dry up Dursley you great prune. Well, I haven't seen you since you was a baby Harry. But you're a bit more along then I would have expected; particularly around the middle. I'm not... I'm not Harry. I am. Well of course you are! Got something for you. Afraid I might have sat on it at some point but I imagine it'll taste fine just the same. Baked it myself, words and all. Thank you! It's not everyday your young man turns 11 now it is? Excuse me, but who are you? Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. Of course you know all about Hogwarts Sorry, no. No? Blimey Harry didn't you ever wonder didn't you ever wonder how your mum and dad learned it all? Learned what? You're a wizard Harry. I'm a what? A wizard. And a thumpin' good one I'd wager once you've trained up a bit. No, you've made a mistake. I mean I can't be a wizard... I mean I'm Harry, Just Harry. Well, "Just Harry" did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain, when you were angry or scared? Um Hum. Dear Mr. Potter, we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He will not be going! We swore when we took him in that we would put a stop to all of this rubbish! You knew? We knew all along and you never told me? Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect being who she was. Oh I remember the day she got her letter. My parents were so proud. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one who saw her for what she was... a freak. And then she met that Potter, and then she had you and I knew you would be the same just as strange just as abnormal. And then, if you please, she got herself blown up, and we got landed with you. Blown up?! You told me my parents died in a car crash! A car crash? A car crash killed Lily and James Potter? We had to say something! It's an outrage. It's a scandal. He will not be going. Oh and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself is gonna stop him. Muggle? Non- magic folk. This boy's had his name down since he were born. He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. And he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen, Albus Dumbledore... I will not pay to have some crack pot old fool teach him magic tricks! Never insult Albus Dumbledore in front of me... I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking I'm not supposed to do magic. OK We're a bit behind schedule. Best be off. Unless you'd rather stay, of course. All students must be equipped with a one standard size two pewter cauldron, and may bring, if they desire, either an owl, a cat, or a toad. Can we find all this in London? If you know where to go. Ah, Hagrid the usual I presume. No thanks Tom, I'm on official Hogwarts business. Just helping young Harry buy his school business. Bless my soul, it's Harry Potter. Welcome back Mr. Potter welcome back. Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last. Harry P-p-potter. C-can't tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you. hello, professor I didn't see you there. Harry Professor Quirrell will be your defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Oh, nice to meet you, A fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, eh, P-potter? Yes, well must be going now. Lots to buy. Good bye. See, Harry? You're famous. But why am I famous Hagrid? All those people back there how is it they know who I am? I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry. Welcome Harry, to Diagon Alley. That's where you get your quills and ink. Over there, all your bits and bobs for doing wizardry. It's a world class racing broom. Wow! Look at it the new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet! But Hagrid how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money. Well there's your money Harry! Gringotts, the wizard bank! Ain't no safer place, not one! 'Cept perhaps Hogwarts. Hagrid what exactly are these things? They're goblins Harry. Clever as they come the goblins, but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stay close. Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key? Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Ha! There's the little devil. Oh, and there's something else as well. Professor Dumbledore gave me this. It's about You- Know- What in vault you know which. Very well. Vault 687. Lamp please. Key, please Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing now did you? Vault 713. What's in there Hagrid? Can't tell you Harry. Hogwarts business. Very secret. Stand back. Best not to mention this to anyone Harry. I still need... a wand. A wand? Well, you want Ollivander's. There ain't no place better. Why don't you run along and wait. I got one more thing to do. Won't be long. Hello? Hello? I wondered when I'd be seeing you Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that you mother and father were in here buying their first wands. Here we are. Well give it a wave. Apparently not. Perhaps this. NO, no definitely not. No matter. I wonder... Curious... very curious Sorry but what's curious I remember every wand that I've sold Mr. Potter, every one. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather resides in your wand, gave another feather. Just one other. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. And who owned that wand? We do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard Mr. Potter. It is not always clear why. But I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things. Terrible, yes, but great. Harry! Harry! Happy Birthday! Woah! You all right Harry? You seem very quiet. He killed my parents didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know Hagrid. I know you do. First and understand this Harry because it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago one of them went as bad as you can go. His name was V--. His name was V--. Well maybe if you wrote it down? Naw I can't spell it. All right, Voldemort. Voldemort? Shh. It was dark times Harry, dark times. Voldemort started to gather some followers. Brought them over to the Dark Side. Anyone who stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him. Nobody lived once he decided to kill them. Nobody, not one. Except you. Me? Voldemort tried to kill me? Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead Harry. A mark from that only comes from being touched by a curse, an evil curse at that. What happened to V--... To You-Know-Who? Well some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there still too tired to carry on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why everybody knows your name. You're the boy who lived. Well some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there still too tired to carry on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why everybody knows your name. You're the boy who lived. What are you looking at? Blimey is that time? Sorry Harry, but I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore would be wanting his... Well, he'd be wanting to see me. Now, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. Stick to it Harry, that's very important. Stick to you ticket. Platform 9 ¾? But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9 ¾. There's no such thing. Is there? Sorry. Excuse me! Excuse me! On your left. Excuse me sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9 ¾? 9 ¾? Think you're being funny do you? It's the same every year packed with Muggles of course. Come on! Muggles? Platform 9 ¾ this way! All right Percy you first. Fred you next. He's not Fred I am! Honestly, woman you call yourself our mother! I'm sorry George. Only joking! I am Fred. Excuse me! Could you tell me how to... How to get on to the platform? Yes, not to worry dear, it's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well. Now, all you have to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a run if you're nervous. Good luck! Excuse me, do you mind? Every where else is full. Not at all. I'm Ron by the way! Ron Weasley. I'm Harry. Harry Potter. SO it's true! DO you really have the... the... The what? The scar? Oh! Wicked! Anything off the trolley dears? No, thanks, I'm all set. We'll take the lot! Woah! Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans? They mean every flavor! There's chocolate, peppermint and also, spinach liver, and tripe. George sweared he got boogie flavored one once. These aren't real frogs are they? It's just a spell. But it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 me self. Watch it! That's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with. I've got Dumbledore! I've got about 6 of him. Hey, he's gone! Well you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? This is Scabbers by the way. Pathetic isn't he? Just a little bit. Fred gave me a spell to turn him yellow. Want to see? Yeah! Ahem... Sunshine... has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's has one. No. Oh are you doing magic? Let's see then. Ahem. Sunshine Daisies Butter Mellow Turn this stupid fat rat yellow. Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good is it? Of course, I've only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me. For example: Oculus Reparo. That's better isn't it? Holy cricket! You're Harry Potter! I'm Hermione Granger. And you are...? I'm Ron Weasley. Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. You've dirt on your nose by the way. Just there. Right then. First years this way, please! First years, don't be shy. Come on now, hurry up! Hello Harry! Hi Hagrid! Woah! Right, then. This way to the boats. Come on now, follow me. Wicked! Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Now while you're here your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you points. Any rule breaking and you will loose points. At the end of the year, the houses with the most points is awarded the house cup. Trevor! Sorry. The Sorting Ceremony will begin momentarily. It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. Harry Potter? This is Crabbe and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. Think my name's funny do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley. You'll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. I think I can tell the wrong sort for my self thanks. We're ready for you. Follow me. It's not real the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History. Will you wait along here please. Now before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words. I have a few start-of-term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note, that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you that the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to all who do not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you. When I call your name you will come forth, I shall place the Sorting Hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger! Oh, no. OK relax. Mental that one, I'm telling you. Ah, right then. Hum... Right. Okay, Gryffindor! Draco Malfoy! Slytherin! There's no witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. Susan Bones! Ow! Harry what is it? Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine ...where shall I put you? Let's see... I know! Hufflepuff! Ronald Weasley! Ha! Another Weasley! I know just what to do with you... Gryffindor! Harry potter Hmmm... Difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you... Not Slytherin, not Slytherin! Not Slytherin eh? Are you sure? You could be great you know. It's all herein your head. And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, there's no doubt about that. No? (Harry whispering: Please, Please anything but Slytherin, anything but Slytherin.) Well if you're sure, better be... Gryffindor! Your attention please. Let the feast begin! Wow! I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle, mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out! Say Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell? Oh, Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house. What's he teach? Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrell's job for years. Ah! Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor. It's the Bloody Baron! Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer? Dismal. Once again my request to join the Headless Hunt has been denied. I know you. You're Nearly Headless Nick. I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind. "Nearly" headless? How can you be "nearly" headless? Like this. Ah! Gryffindors, follow me, please. Keep up. Thank-you. Ravenclaw follow me. This way. This is the most direct part to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases, they like to change. Keep up please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on. That picture's moving! Look at that one. I think she fancies you. Look, look! Who's that girl? Welcome to Hogwarts! Password? Caput Draconis. Follow me, everyone. Keep up. Quickly, come on! Gather around here. Welcome to the Gryffindor common room. Boys' dormitories is upstairs and down to your left. Girls the same on your right. You'll find all your belonging have already been brought up. Whew! We made it! Can you imagine the look on McGonagall's face if we were late? That was bloody brilliant! Thank-you for that assessment Mr. Weasley. Perhaps it would be more useful if I transfigured Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocket watch. That way one of you might be on time. We got lost. Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats. There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few who possess the predisposition. I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I show you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death. Then again maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to not pay attention. Mr. Potter, our new celebrity. Tell me what would I get if I added root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? You don't know? Well let's try again. Where Mr. Potter would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? I don't know, sir. And what is the difference between monkswood and wolfsbane? I don't know sir. Pity. Clearly fame isn't everything. Is it Mr. Potter? Eye of rabbit, harp sting hum, turn this water into rum... Eye of rabbit harp sting hum, turn this water into rum. What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water? Turn it to rum. Actually he managed to make weak tea yesterday, before--- Ah, mail's here. Can I burrow this? Thanks. Hey look! Neville's got a Remembrall. I've read about those. When the smoke turns red it means you've forgotten something. The only problem is I can't remember what I have forgotten. Hey Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen: "Believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown, Gringotts goblins were acknowledging the breach insist nothing was taken. The vault in question number 713 had been emptied earlier that very same day." That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to. Good afternoon, class. Good afternoon Madame Hooch. Good afternoon Amanda, good afternoon. Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say up. Up! Up! Woah! Up. Up. Up! With feeling! Up. Up! Up. Up! UP! Ow! Shut up Harry. Now once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. Grip it tight. You don't wanna be sliding off the end. When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle. Three, two... Mr. Longbottom. Mr. Mr. Mr. Longbottom! Down! Down! Neville! Help! Help! Come back down this instant! Mr. Longbottom! Everyone out of the way! Is he alright? Ow! Oh oh oh. Oh dear, it's a broken wrist. Poor boy. Come on now, up you get. Everyone is to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say "Quidditch". Did you see his face? If the fat lump had given this a squeeze he would remember to fall on his fat arse. Give it here Malfoy. No, I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. How about on the roof? What's the matter Potter? Bit beyond you reach? Harry! No way! You heard what Madame Hooch said. Besides you don't even know how to fly! What an idiot! Give it here Malfoy or I'll knock you off your broom! Is that so? Have it your way, then! Yeah! Nice going, Harry! That was wicked Harry! Harry Potter! Follow me. You wait here. ... this is an ingredient... Professor Quirrell, excuse me, excuse me could I borrow Wood for a moment, please? Well, yes of course. Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood I have found you a Seeker. Have you heard Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew he'd do well. Seeker? But first years never make the house teams. You must be the youngest Quidditch player in... A century. According to McGonagall. Well dome Harry! Wood's just told us! Fred and George are on the team too. Beaters. Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloody up too bad. Can't make any promises of course. Rough game Quidditch. Brutal! But, nobody's died in years. Someone vanishes occasionally. But they'll turn up in a month or two! Oh go on Harry! Quidditch is great. Best game there is, and you'll be great too! But I've never even played Quidditch! What if I make a fool of myself? You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood. Woah! Harry, you never told me your father was a seeker too! I didn't know. I'm telling you, it's spooky! She knows move about you than you do! Who doesn't? What's happening? The staircases change remember? Let's go this way. Before the staircase moves again. Does anybody feel like we shouldn't be here? We're not supposed to be here. This is the third floor. It's forbidden! Let's go. Flich's cat! Run! Quick, let's hide through that door! It's locked! that's it we're done for! Oh! Move over! Alohomora! Get in! Alohomora? Standard Book Of Spells- Chapter 7! Any one here my sweet? Come on. He thinks this door is locked. He thinks this door is locked. It was locked. And for good reason. AH! What do they think they're doing? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school? You don't use your eyes do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on? I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice... the three! It was standing on a trap door. It wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something. Guarding something? That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get killed or worse... expelled. She needs to sort out her priorities. Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each team has 7 players. Three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper and a Seeker, that's you. There are three kinds of balls. This one's called the Quaffle. The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. The Keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. With me so far? I think so. What are those? You better take this. Careful now, it's coming back. Not bad Potter, you'd make a fair Beater. Uh-oh. What was that? Bludgers. Nasty little buggers. But you are a Seeker. The only thing I want you to worry about is this, the Golden Snitch. I like this ball. Eh, you like it now. But it's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see. What do I do with it? You catch it. Before the other team's Seeker. You catch this the game's over. You catch this, Potter, and we win. Woah! One of a wizard's most rudimental skill is levitation or the ability to make objects fly. Do you all have your feathers? Good. Now don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing. Hum! The "Swish and Flick". Everyone, the "Swish and Flick". Good! Oh and annunciate! Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then! Wingardium Leviosa; Wingardium Leviosa! Wingardium Leviosa! No, stop stop stop! You're going to take someone's eye out! Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-o-sa, not Leviosar. You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on! Wingardium Leviosa. Oh oh! Well done! See here everyone, Miss Granger's done it! Ho ho! Splendid! Wingard-Leviosa; Wingard-- Leviosa Well done dear. OH! I think we're going to need another feather over here professor. "It's Levi-o-sa not Leviosar." She's a nightmare honestly! It's no wonder she hasn't got any friends! I think she heard you. Where's Hermione? Parvati Patil said she's wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said she's been there all afternoon, crying. Troll in the dungeon! Troll in the dungeon! Though you ought to know. Ah! SILENCE! Everyone will please not panic! Now prefects please escort your house to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons. Gryffindors, keep up, please, and stay alert! How could a troll get in? Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. What? Hermione! She doesn't know! I think the troll's left the dungeon! It's going into the girl's bathroom. Hermione move! Help! Help! Hey, pea brain! Ah! Help! Woah! Ugh! Do something! What? Anything! Hurry up! "Swish & Flick!" Wingardium Leviosa! Cool. Is it dead? No just knocked out. Ugh. Troll boogies. Oh my goodness! Explain yourselves both of you! Well what it is- It's my fault Professor Mc Gonagall Miss. Granger? I went looking for the troll I've read about them and I though I could handle it. But I was wrong.If Harry and Ron hadn’t come and found me... I’d probably be dead. Be that as it may, it was an extremely foolish thing to do. I would have expected more rational behavior on your part and am very disappointed in you Miss. Granger. Five points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgement. As for you two gentle I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many first year students could take on a fully grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. Five points will be awarded to each of you, for sheer dumb luck. Perhaps you ought to go. It might wake up. Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on. Ron's right Harry, you're going to need your strength today. I'm not hungry. Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you. Even if it is against Slytherin. That explains the blood. Blood? Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as diversion so he could get past that three headed dog. But, he got bit, that's why he's limping. But why would anyone go near that dog? The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. Said it was Hogwarts business, very secret. So you're saying- That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants. A bit early for mail isn't it? But, I never get mail. Let's open it. It's a broomstick. It's not just a broomstick, Harry. It's a Nimbus 2000! But who--? Scared, Harry? A little. It's alright. I felt the same way before my first game. What happened? I.. uh...I don't really remember... Took a Bludger to the head two minutes in. Woke in the hospital a week later. Hello! Welcome to Hogwart's first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game: Slytherin vs. Gryffindor! The player take their positions as Madam Hooch steps onto the field to begin the game! Now, I want a nice clean game... from all of you. The Bludgers are up. Followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember the Snitch is worth 150 points. The Seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game. The Quaffle is released and the game begins! Anjelina Johnson scores! Ten points for Gryffindor! Well done! Slytherin takes the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint. Another ten points to Gryffindor! Give me that! Take that side! What's going on with Harry's broomstick? It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom! Jinxing the broom?! What do we do? Leave it to me! Come on Hermione! Lacarnum Inflamarae. Fire! You're on fire! Go, go, go, go! Looks like he's gonna be sick! He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch! Gryffindor wins! Yes! Harry Potter Gyffindor! Harry Potter Gyffindor! Harry Potter Gyffindor! Harry Potter Gyffindor! Harry Potter Gyffindor! Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom? Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween? Who told you about Fluffy? Fluffy? That thing has a name? Well, of course, he's got a name! He's mine! I brought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the--- Yes? I shouldn't have said that. No more questions! Don't ask anymore question! That's top- secret that is. But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding Snape's trying to steal it! Codswallop! Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher! Hogwarts teacher or not I know a spell when I see one! I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact and Snape wasn't blinking! Exactly. Now listen to me, all three of you, you're meddling in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous! What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel. Nicholas Flamel? I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that. Nicholas Flamel. Who's Nicholas Flamel? I don't know. Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas. Ring the Hogwart bell. Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas. Cast a Christmas spell. Knight to E-5. Queen to E-5. That's totally barbaric! That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed. See you haven't. Change of plans. My parents have decided to go to Romania to visit my brother Charlie. He's studying dragons there. Good. You can help Harry then. He's going to look in the library for information on Nicholas Flamel. We've looked a hundred times! Not in the Restricted Section. Happy Christmas. I think we've had a bad influence on her. Harry wake up! Come on Harry! Wake up! Happy Christmas Harry! Happy Christmas Ron! What are you wearing? Oh, my mum made it. Looks like you've got one too. I've got presents? Yeah! There they are. "Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well."? What is it? Some kind of cloak. Well let's see then! Put it on! Woah! My body is gone! I know what that is! That's an Invisibility Cloak! I'm invisible? They're really rare. I wonder who gave it to you. There was no name. It just said, "Use it well." Famous Fire Eaters. Fifteenth Century Fiends. Flamel. Nicholas Flamel. Where are you? I know you're in there. You can't hide. Who is it? Show yourself! Severus I-I-I You don't want me as your enemy Quirrell. I don't know what you mean. You know perfectly well what I mean. We'll have another little chat soon. When you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie. Professors. I found this in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed. Mum, Dad? Ron! You've really gotta see this! Ron! You've gotta see this! Ron! Come on, get out of bed! Why? There's something you've got to see! Now, come on! Come on! Come! Come look! It's my parents! I only see us. Look in properly. Go on, stand there. There. You see them don't you? That's--- That's me! Only, I'm Head Boy. And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup. And bloody hell! I'm Quidditch captain too! I look good! Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future? How can it? Both my parents are dead. Back again Harry? I see that you, like many others before you have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust now, you realize what it what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look in the mirror and only see himself exactly as he is. So then, it shows us what we want... Whatever we want? Yes, and no. It shows us nothing more or less then the deepest and most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you Harry, who have never known your family you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it. Even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home. And I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out weeks ago for a bit of light reading! This is light? Of course! Here it is! "Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone The what? Honestly don't you two read? "The Sorcerer's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will transform any metal into pure gold and produce the Elixir of Life which will make the drinker immortal." Immortal! It means you'll never die. I know what it means! The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist who last year celebrated his 665th birthday." That's what Fluffy's guarding on the third floor. That's what's under the trap door. The Sorcerer's Stone. Hagrid! Oh, hello. I don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today. We know about the Sorcerer's Stone! We think Snape's trying to steal it. Snape? Blimey, you're still on about him, are you? Hagrid! We know he's after the Stone we just don't know why! Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it. What? You heard. Right, now, come on, I'm a bit preoccupied today. Wait a minute! "One of the teachers"? Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments? Right. Waste of bloody time if you ask me. Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Ain't a soul knows how, except me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I should not have told you that. Hagrid, what exactly is that? Oh, That? It's a...it's um... I know what that is! But Hagrid how did you get one? I won it! Off a stranger I met at the pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid of it, as a matter of fact. Is that...a dragon? That's not just a dragon! That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania. Isn't he beautiful? Oh bless him look, he knows his mummy! Hello Norbert! Norbert? Well he's gotta have a name don't he? Don't you Norbert? Te de de de de! Oh! Woah! He'll have to be trained up a bit of course. Who's that? Malfoy. Oh, dear. Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I ever met him. It's crazy! And worse Malfoy knows. I don't understand. Is that bad? It's bad. Good evening. Nothing I repeat nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken. 50! Each. And to ensure that it doesn't happen again all four of you will receive detention. Excuse me professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said the four of us. No you heard me correctly Mr. Malfoy. You see, honorable as your intentions were you too were out of bed after hours. You will join you classmates in detention. A pity they let the old punishments die. Was a time detention found you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I'll miss the screaming. You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the Dark Forest. A sorry lot, this, Hagrid. Oh good God you're not still on about that bloody dragon now are you? Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony. Well, that's good isn't it? He'll be with his own kind. Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby after all. Oh, for God's sake pull yourself together man. You're going into the Forest after all. Got to have your wits about you. The Forest? I thought that was a joke. We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are... werewolves! Ah, there's more that werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that. Nighty- night. Right, let's go. Hagrid, what is that? What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been hurt bad by something. So, it's our job to go and find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me. Okay... And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. Okay, then I get Fang! Fine. Just so you know he's bloody coward. Wait till my father hears about this! This is servant stuff. If I didn't know better Draco, I'd say you were scared. Scared Potter. Did you hear that? Come on Fang! Scared! What is it Fang? AH! Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The Forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you. But what was that thing you saved me from? A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. For you have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips you have a half-life, a cursed life. But who would choose such a life? Can you think of no one? You mean to say that thing that killed the unicorn, that was drinking its blood, that was Voldemort? Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment, Mr. Potter? The Sorcerer's Stone! Harry! Hello there Firenze. See you've met our young Mr. Potter. All right there Harry? Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You are safe now. Good luck. You mean, that You- Know- Who is out there right now in the Forest? But he's weak. He's living off of unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong! Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself. He wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will become strong again. He, he'll come back. But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you? I think if he had his chance he would have tried to kill me tonight. And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final. Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort is always feared? Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around you can't be touched. I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were frightful, but I found they're rather enjoyable Speak for yourself. All right there Harry? My scar. It keeps burning. It's happened before. Not like this. Perhaps you should see the nurse. I think it's a warning. It means danger's coming. Ah. Oh, Of Course. What is it? Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid want more than anything is a dragon and a stranger turns up and just happens to have one? I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you that dragon egg? What did he look like? I dunno. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up. This stranger though, you and he must have talked. Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. And I told him, after Fluffy a dragon's gonna be no problem. Did he seem interested in Fluffy? Well of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across three headed dogs do you come across even if you're in the trade? But I told him, I said, I said, "The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him." Take Fluffy for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight asleep. I shouldn't have told you that. Where are you going? Where are you---? We have to see professor Dumbledore immediately! We have to see Professor Dumbledore immediately! I’m afraid Professor Dumbledore’s not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London. He’s gone! But this is important! This is about the Sorcerer’s Stone! How did you know--? Someone’s going to try to steal it! I don’t know how you three found out about the Stone but I assure you it is perfectly well protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories quietly. That was no stranger Hagrid met. It was Snape. Which means that he knows how to get past Fluffy. And with Dumbledore gone--- Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors, such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this? We were... we were just--- You’d ought to be careful. People willht think you’re up to something. Now what are we do? We go down the trap door, tonight. Trevor. Trevor, sh, go you shouldn’t be here! Neither should you. You’re sneaking out again aren’t you? Now Neville listen. We were... we were--- No I won’t let you! You’ll get Gryffindor into trouble again! I’ll, I’ll fight you! Neville, I’m really really sorry about this. Petrificus totalus! You’re a little scary sometimes, you know that. Brilliant, but scary. Let’s go. Sorry. Sorry. It’s for your own good you know. Ow! You stood on my foot! Sorry. Alohomora. Wait a minute. He’s snoring. Snape’s already been here. He’s put a spell on the harp. Ugh! It’s got horrible breath. We have to move its paw. What? Come on! Okay, push! I’ll go first. Don’t follow me until I give you a sign. If something bad happens get yourselves out! Does it seem a bit quiet to you? The harp, it stopped playing. Ugh! Yuck! Ugh! Jump! Woah! Lucky this plant thing’s here really! Woah! Stop moving, both of you! This is Devil’s Snare. You have to relax! If you don’t it’ll only kill you faster! Kill us faster? Oh now I can relax! Hermione! Oh now what are we going to do? Just relax! Hermione where are you? Do what I say! Trust me! Ah! Harry! Harry! Are you okay? Yeah, yeah I’m fine. (Ron Weasley: Help!) He’s not relaxing is he? (Ron Weasley: Help!) Apparently not. (Ron Weasley: Help me!) We’ve got to do something! (Ron Weasley: Help!) What? (Ron Weasley: Help!) I remember reading something in Herbology. (Ron Weasley: Help!) “Devil’s Snare Devil’s Snare it’s deadly fun; but will sulk in the sun.” That’s it! Devil’s Snare hates sunlight! Lumus Solem! Ron, are you okay? Yeah. Lucky we didn’t panic! Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology. What is that? I don’t know Sounds like wings. Curious, I’ve never seen birds like these. They’re not birds they’re keys. And I’ll bet one of then fits that door. What’s this all about? I don’t know. Strange. Alohomora! Well, it was worth a try. What are we going to do? There must be a thousand keys up there! We’re looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle. There! I see it! The one with the broken wing! What’s wrong Harry? It is too simple. Oh, go on Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You’re the youngest Seeker in a century! This complicates things a bit! Catch the key! Hurry up! I don’t like this. I don’t like this at all. Where are we? A graveyard? This is no graveyard, it’s a chessboard. There’s the door! Now what do we do? Its obvious isn’t it? We’ve got to play our way across the room. All right, Harry, you take the empty bishop’s square. Hermione you’ll be the queen-side castle. As for me, I’ll be a knight. What happens now? Well, white moves first, and then we play. Ron you don’t suppose this’ll be like real wizard’s chess do you? You there D-5. Yes Hermione I think this is gonna be exactly like wizard’s chess. Castle to E-4! Pawn to C-3! Wait a minute. You understand right Harry. Once I make my move the queen will take me. Then you’re free to check the king. No. Ron no! What is it? He is going to sacrifice himself! No you can’t! There must be another way! Do you wanna stop Snape from getting that Stone or not? Harry, it’s you that has to go on. I know it! Not me! Not Hermione! You! Knight to H-3. Check. Ah! Ron! No don’t move! Don’t forget we’re still playing! Checkmate! Take care of Ron then go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron’s right. I have to go on. You’ll be okay Harry. You’re a great wizard. You really are. Not as good as you. Me? Books, cleverness. There are more important things. Friendship and bravery. And Harry, just be careful. You? No it can’t be; Snape he was he was the one--- Yes he does seem the type doesn’t he? Next to him who would suspect p-p-poor st-st-stuttering Professor Quirrell? But that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me. Oh no dear boy, I tried to kill you! And trust me if Snape’s cloak hadn’t caught on fire and broken my eye contact I would have succeeded. Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse. Snape was trying to save me? I knew you were a danger to me right from the off. Especially after Halloween. Then then you let the troll in! Very good Potter yes. Snape unfortunately wasn’t fooled, when every one else was running about the dungeon Snape went to the third floor to head me of. He of course never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone. But he doesn’t understand, I’m never alone. Never. Now does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the Stone. But how do I get it? Use the boy. Come here Potter! Now! Tell me what do you see? What is it what do you see? I’m shaking hands with Dumbledore. I’ve won the House Cup. He lies. Tell the truth! What do you see? Let me speak to him. Master you are not strong enough. have strength enough for this. Harry Potter, we meet again. Voldemort? Yes, you see what I have become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something that conveniently enough lies in your pocket. Stop him! Don’t be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join with me and live? Never! Bravery, your parents had it too. Tell me Harry would you like to see your mother and father again? Together we can bring them back. All I ask is for something in return. That’s it Harry. There is no good and evil, there is only power and those too weak to seek it. Together we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the Stone! You liar! Kill him! What is this magic? Fool get the Stone! Good afternoon Harry. Tokens from your admirers. Admirers? What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret. So naturally the whole school knows. Ah, I see that your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs. Ron was here? Is he alright? What about Hermione? Fine. They're both just fine. Bu, what happened to the Stone? Relax dear boy. The Stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I have had a little chat and agreed it was best all around. But then Flamel, he'll die won't he? He has enough Elixir of Life to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die. How is it I got the Stone sir? One minute I was there staring in the mirror and then the next--- Ah, you see only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me that is saying something. Does that mean with the Stone gone that is, that Voldemort can never come back? Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you. And that kind of act leaves a mark. No, no this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin. What is it? Love Harry. Love. Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavor one. Since then I'm afraid I've lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee. Alas! Earwax! Alright there Ron? Alright. You? Alright. Hermione? Never better. Another year gone. And now as I understand it, the House Cup needs awarding. And the points stand as thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. Third place, Hufflepuff with 352 points. In second place Ravenclaw with 426 points. And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House. Nice one mate. Yes, yes. Well-done Slytherin. Well-done Slytherin. However recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last-minute points to award. To Miss. Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect when others were in grave peril. 50 points. Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen these many years. 50 points. And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage. I award Gryffindor House 60 points. We're tied with Slytherin! And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies. But a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom. Assuming my calculations are correct I believe that a change of decoration is in order. Gryffindor wins the House Cup! Yes! Come on now. Hurry up, you'll be late! Train's leaving. Go on. Come on, hurry up. Come on Harry. One minute. Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye did you? This is for you. Thanks Hagrid. Oh. Go on. On with you. On with you now. On with you. Oh, listen, Harry. If that dolt of a cousin of yours Dudley gives you any grief you can always um... threaten him, with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his. But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that. I know that. But your cousin don't do he? Feels strange to be going home doesn't it? I'm not going home. Not really.
