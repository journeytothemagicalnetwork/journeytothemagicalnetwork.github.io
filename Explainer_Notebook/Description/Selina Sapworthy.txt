She was also a loyal servant to the [[International Quidditch Team]],<ref name=\"HPLE\"/> sometime after her graduation.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nSelina Sapworthy was born somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]] and, in her youth, attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], where she was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]].<ref name=\"portrait\">See [[:File:SelinaSapworthy.jpg|this image]]</ref> During this time, she presumably excelled in the studies of [[Herbology]] and [[Divination]], as she later wrote books on both subjects.\n\n===Later life===\nOnce she graduated from Hogwarts, Sapworthy became a loyal servant to the [[International Quidditch Team]].<ref name=\"HPLE\"/>\n\nShe went on to write a [[Herbology]] [[Book]], ''[[Winogrand's Wondrous Water Plants]]'', focusing specifically on the [[water]] plants among [[Winogrand|Sir Winogrand's]] collection in the [[African Lakes]]. It was part of the required reading at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] for at least a quarter of a century.<ref name=\"book\">{{HPLE|G}} (see [[:File:Winogrand'sFrontAndBackCover.png|this image]]).</ref> She also published ''[[Xylomancy (book)|Xylomancy]]'', a book exploring the eponymous (and often overlooked) art of [[Xylomancy|Divination by twigs]].<ref name=\"Pottermore\">{{PM}}</ref>\n\nA [[portrait]] of her was hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]] by the [[1990s]], near the sixth-floor landing of the [[Grand Staircase]].\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Herbology]]''': Selina Sapworthy was an accomplished [[Herbologist]] with much knowledge of different [[magic]]al plants and fungi, having written the Herbology textbook ''[[Winogrand's Wondrous Water Plants]]'', a guide which specifically focuses on aquatic plant life, showing she was very knowledgeable and experienced in this field.\n*'''[[Divination]]''': Sapworthy was also very skilful and experienced in this rather esoteric and mysterious branch of magic, having authored the book ''[[Xylomancy (book)|Xylomancy]]'', which covers the art of [[Xylomancy]], the form of divination which involves the usage of twigs, showing she had much knowledge of this subject.\n\n==Etymology==\n*Selina is the English variant of the name Celine. Celine is a French feminine name that either descends from the Roman name ''Caelinus, ''which is derived from the Latin word ''caelum'', meaning \"heaven,\" or serves a nickname for ''Marceline, ''which is also Latin in origin and is related to the name of the Roman god Mars.\n\n*Selina is also an alternate spelling of the name Selena. \"Selena\" is the Latinized form of \"Selene\", a Greek name meaning \"moon.\" Selene was the Greek goddess of the moon, later conflated with the goddess Artemis.<ref name=\"BTN\">[http://www.behindthename.com/name/selena \"Selena\"] on [http://www.behindthename.com/ Behind the Name]</ref>\n*\"Sapworthy\" may be a variation of the [[England|English]] surname \"Sapworth\" and a pun on the word \"sap,\" the fluid that circulates in the vascular system of a plant. Both Sapworthy's known published works involve plants in some way.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*The portrait of Selina Sapworthy featured in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]] seems to have been based on a [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/RothwellMaryShelley.jpg 1840 portrait of Mary Shelley], author of the Gothic novel ''[[Wikipedia:Frankenstein|Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus]]'', by artist [[Wikipedia:Richard Rothwell|Richard Rothwell]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|F}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{DH|F2}} {{Comment|Name on book cover}}\n*{{PM}} {{Mention}}\n*''[[The Art of Harry Potter Mini Book of Graphic Design]]''\n*{{HM}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sapworthy, Selina}}\n\n{{Herbology}}\n{{Hogwarts sixth floor}}\n\n[[es:Selina Sapworthy]]\n[[it:Selina Sapworthy]]\n[[pl:Selina Sapworthy]]\n[[fr:Selina Sapworthy]]\n[[ru:\u0421\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u044d\u043f\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0444\u0438]]\n[[Category:Authors]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Herbologists]]\n[[Category:Portraits]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
