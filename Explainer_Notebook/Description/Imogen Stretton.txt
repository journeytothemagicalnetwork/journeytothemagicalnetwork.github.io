He based her on a legendary character named Innogen, but the name was printed incorrectly and never corrected. The name Innogen is probably derived from Gaelic inghean meaning \"maiden\".\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{PS2 only}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stretton, Imogen}}\n\n[[pl:Imogen Stretton]]\n[[ru:\u0418\u043c\u043e\u0434\u0436\u0435\u043d \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0442\u043e\u043d]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Stretton family]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
