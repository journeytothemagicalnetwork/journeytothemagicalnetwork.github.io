In {{HM}}, he was attending Hogwarts in a timed side quest set in Year 2 (the [[1985\u20131986 school year]]), causing an anachronism, as Orsino was only be around nine years old at the time. Similar issues have been present in other timed side quests as well, meaning it is possible the side quest actually takes place in a later year.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Orsino\" is the Italian form of the Roman name Ursinus, itself derived from Ursus. This is the name of a character in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] comedic play 'Twelfth Night' ([[1602]]).\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Orsino Thruston}}\n*{{PS|G}} {{FWC}}\n*{{COS|G}} {{FWC}}\n*{{GOF}} {{Comment|unnamed}}\n*{{GOF|F}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}} {{Comment|Appears as \"Drummer\"}}\n*{{HM}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Weird Sisters}}\n{{Chocolate Frog Cards}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thruston, Orsino}}\n\n[[de:Orsino Thruston]]\n[[es:Orsino Thruston]]\n[[fr:Orsino Thruston]]\n[[fi:Orsino Thruston]]\n[[it:Orsino Thruston]]\n[[pl:Orsino Thruston]]\n[[ru:\u041e\u0440\u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d\u043e \u0424\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043d]]\n[[Category:1976 births]]\n[[Category:Bronze Chocolate Frog Cards]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1987]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Weird Sisters]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
