[[22 November]],<ref name=\"shortstories\"/> pre-[[1927]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who, after graduating from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], served as [[professor]] of [[Care of Magical Creatures]].<ref name=\"POA5\"/> His recklessness and the nature of his subject resulted in him losing all his limbs but one arm and half of one leg. He retired in [[1993]],<ref name=\"POA5\"/> but still made visits to [[dragon]] sanctuaries.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nSilvanus Kettleburn was born to [[Silvanus Kettleburn's father|a wizard]] and [[Silvanus Kettleburn's mother|a witch]] on [[22 November]]. He received magical instruction at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], in which he was Sorted into [[Hufflepuff]],<ref name=\"Pottermore\" /> and presumably achieved high marks in [[Care of Magical Creatures]], later leading him to become a teacher in that subject.\n\nAt some point in his life, Silvanus owned twelve pet [[niffler]]s. They destroyed his home, his boat and his favourite replacement leg. Instead of being sad or angry, however, he was ecstatic and could hardly wait to get twelve more.<ref name=\"HM411\"/>\n\n===Professor of Care of Magical Creatures===\n====Under Headmaster Armando Dippet====\n{{Quote|...it was several months before the Great Hall lost its pungent aroma of wood smoke, and even longer before Professor Beery's head reassumed its normal proportions, and Professor Kettleburn was taken off probation...|''The Fountain of Fair Fortune'' incident|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}\nAt some point during the early to mid-[[1920s]] or earlier, Silvanus met and befriended the famous [[Magizoologist]] [[Newton Scamander]], whom he helped with his best-selling book {{FB}} by providing some of the information it contained about [[Chimaera]]s.<ref name=\"HM4\"/>\n\nAt some point in his life, Kettleburn became the [[Professor]] of [[Care of Magical Creatures]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]] under [[Headmaster]] [[Armando Dippet]]. During his time as a professor, Kettleburn amassed sixty-two periods of probations.<ref name=\"TBB\">{{TBB|F}}</ref> One of which was when a worm he provided for the play of ''[[The Fountain of Fair Fortune]]'' (which was in fact, an [[Engorgement Charm|Engorged]] [[Ashwinder]]) exploded and started a [[fire]]. This started a [[Duelling|duel]] between the girls playing [[Amata]] and [[Asha]], in which [[Herbert Beery|Professor Herbert Beery]] was caught in the crossfire. Beery's head was reported to have been disfigured. It took him a long time for it to return to normal, which led to his retirement as a [[professor]].<ref name=\"TBB\" />\n\nAt some point in or after the 1969\u20131970 school year, a student by the name of [[Patricia Rakepick]] approached him for information about how to enter the [[Forbidden Forest]] undetected. Seen as how she was his most gifted pupil at the time of her inquiry, he questioned her as to why she wanted to go into the forest, to which she replied she merely wanted to explore it and to study the [[magic]]al [[creature]]s that dwelled within it, and told him she meant to become a [[Magizoologist]] after she left school. Accepting this explanation, he advised her to use a [[broomstick]].\n\n====Under Headmaster Albus Dumbledore====\n{{Quote|By the time I became Headmaster, however, Professor Kettleburn had mellowed considerably, although there were always those who took the cynical view that with only one and a half of his original limbs remaining to him, he was forced to take life at a quieter pace.|Kettleburn mellowing due to his extensive injuries|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}\n[[File:HM y4ch1 Silvanus Kettleburn.png|thumb|Professor Kettleburn teaching Care of Magical Creatures]]\nBy the time [[Albus Dumbledore]], the [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] [[Professor]], had taken over from Professor Dippet as [[Headmaster]], Professor Kettleburn had calmed down a considerable amount, though this was likely because he only had one and a half of his original limbs left:<ref name=\"TBB\" /> one arm and half a leg.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\nBy the [[1980s]], Professor Kettleburn had long become one of the regulars at the [[Hospital Wing]] at the school, where he had been treated by [[Poppy Pomfrey]] for and subsequently recuperated from various creature-induced injuries at the [[Hospital Wing]] no less than nineteen times, to the point where he eventually had a bed reserved just for him. Even so, he apparently took this with a surprising amount of good humour, almost affectionately referring to the Hospital Wing as his 'home away from home' during his twentieth time visiting.\n\nDuring the [[1986\u20131987 school year]], he was invited to visit a [[Magical Creatures Reserve in Ireland|Magical Creatures Reserve]] in [[Ireland]], and he left his baby [[Occamy]], [[Squawk]], in the care of the [[Hogwarts Hippogriff Club]].<ref name=\"ABO\">{{HM|3|A BAD OMEN}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[1987\u20131988 school year]], he taught [[Fourth year|fourth-year]]s, such as [[Jacob's sibling]], classes on several magical creatures including [[bowtruckle]]s,<ref name=\"HM43\">{{HM|4|3|cmc}}</ref> [[niffler]]s,<ref name=\"HM46\">{{HM|4|6|cmc}}</ref> [[streeler]]s,<ref name=\"HM411\">{{HM|4|11|cmc}}</ref> and [[kneazle]]s.<ref name=\"HM413\">{{HM|4|13|cmc}}</ref> He also bragged that he had won [[Hogsmeade's Most Maimed Award]] for ten years running.<ref name=\"HM4 Award\">{{HM|4}} (see [https://youtu.be/PPTXBgJKggQ?t=183 this video])</ref>\n\nIn this school year, he spent a considerable time asking for students' help in locating a [[Silvanus Kettleburn's Chimaera|Chimaera]] loose some where on the grounds of Hogwarts.<ref name=\"HM4\">{{HM|4}}</ref> Professor Kettleburn and [[Rubeus Hagrid]] had also been transporting a large number of magical creatures to the school for teaching purposes for the [[Care of Magical Creatures]], when they accidentally lost control over them and they escaped and overran [[Hogwarts Castle]], and got injured while in the process of rounding them up.<ref name=\"HM4 MCE\">{{HM|4|Magical Creatures Everywhere}}</ref>\n\nHe continued to teach these students until their graduation in [[1991]].\n\nThe Hogwarts student [[Jacob's sibling]] described his scent as the streets of [[Edinburgh]] after a storm.<ref name=\"HM4\"/>\n\n===Retirement===\n{{Quote|As to our second new appointment: well, I am sorry to tell you that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher, retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs. However, I am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties.|Announcement of Kettleburn's retirement|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}\n\nKettleburn remained in his position as Professor of [[Care of Magical Creatures]] until [[1993]], when he retired to spend more time with his remaining limbs. According to [[Rubeus Hagrid]], who succeeded him, Professor Dumbledore came straight to [[Hagrid's Hut|his hut]] after Kettleburn said that he had had enough.<ref name=\"POA5\">{{POA|B|5}}</ref> As a retirement present, Albus Dumbledore presented Kettleburn with a set of enchanted wooden prosthetics, which needed constant replacement due to his habit of visiting dragon sanctuaries.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\nDuring his retirement, Professor Kettleburn moved to [[Hogsmeade]]. During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], his physical infirmities prevented him from fighting directly but, determined to play his part, he clambered into his attic and threw his entire stock of [[Flobberworm]]s out of the skylight at passing [[Death Eaters]]. While this had little to no effect on the outcome of the battle, it was generally felt to show the right spirit.<ref name=\"shortstories\" />\n\nHe never married and had no children,<ref name=\"Pottermore\" /> and died sometime prior to [[22 November]], [[2014]].<ref name=\"PMInsider\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Dialogue a-b|Rita Skeeter|You regularly bring children face to face with creatures that could kill them in the blink of an eye.|Silvanus Kettleburn|And I teach them to understand and respect those creatures so no one gets hurt.|Professor Kettleburn refuting sensationalist reporter Rita Skeeter's claim that he did not take his job seriously.|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n[[File:SilvanusKettleburnHM.png|thumb|Kettleburn's cheerful and eccentric demeanour]]\nSilvanus Kettleburn had an extreme, professorial enthusiasm for the subject of [[Magizoology]] and great fondness for magical creatures of all kinds, especially the dangerous ones. Kettleburn was often cheerful but somewhat eccentric. Like [[Newton Scamander]], he advocated for the protection and preservation of magical creatures, informing his class that he would risk life and limb, and indeed had done so, to protect the magical creatures in his care. He was also quite dutiful in regards to his profession, brushing off [[Rita Skeeter]]'s accusation that he was regularly endangering his students by saying he was more careful with his students than he was with himself.\n\nDespite this, Kettleburn was considered reckless by many people, including his former employer [[Armando Dippet]],<ref name=\"TBB\" /> and not without good reason. Indeed: True though it might be that the numerous injuries he had suffered or the limbs he had lost throughout his life, by, in his eagerness, recklessly neglecting to take the proper safety precautions when dealing with beasts, Silvanus Kettleburn did not mind or regret any of them, as he regarded his mangled body as a testament to his dedication to his work.\n\nIn the lesson about Nifflers (with [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick's]] [[Sickleworth|pet]]), Kettleburn confided in her that he owned twelve of them, and still wanted twelve more, even when they had destroyed his boat, house and his favourite prosthetic leg.<ref name=\"HM411\"/>\n\nOne notable example of Kettleburn's recklessness was the ''[[The Fountain of Fair Fortune]]'' incident in the [[Great Hall]]. This incident resulted in a packed [[Hospital Wing]], a Great Hall smelling of burned wood, and [[Herbert Beery]]'s head growing out of proportion. Kettleburn had mellowed considerably by the time Dumbledore took over,<ref name=\"TBB\" /> although he was regarded as a \"''lovable if eccentric man''\".<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n{{Quote|Feel free to approach [[Hieronymus|him]], but watch out for his posterior, as it shoots flames capable of scorching your skin off.
