During the [[1996-1997 school year]], she could usually be found in the entrance to the [[Clock Tower]], and traded [[Gobstones]] for [[Chocolate Frog Card]]s and [[Wizard's Chess|chess]] pieces.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Maria\" is the Latin form of Greek \u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1, from Hebrew \u05de\u05b4\u05e8\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05dd. Maria is the usual form of the name in many European languages, as well as a secondary form in other languages such as English (where the common spelling is Mary). In some countries, for example Germany, Poland and Italy, Maria is occasionally used as a masculine middle name.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{PS2 only}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Glossop, Maria}}\n[[pl:Maria Glossop]]\n[[fr:Maria Glossop]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
