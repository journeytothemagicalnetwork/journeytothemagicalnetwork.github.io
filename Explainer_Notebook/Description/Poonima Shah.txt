She was seen walking around the school during the [[1993-1994 school year]].\n\n==Etymology==\n\nPoonima means 'full moon' in Sanskrit. The Indian surname \n\"Shah\" is mistakenly thought that it is derived from the Persian \"Shah\" meaning \"King\". It is derived from Sanskrit Sadhu (meaning gentleman) and Prakrit Sahu, while the actual spelling \"Shah\" in Western culture was popularised by the title of the former Persian King. In the Gujarat and Rajasthan region, the surname Shah derives from the varnacular sah (from Sanskrit Sadhu, \"merchant\"). \n\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*This student was only featured in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|PlayStation 2 version]] of {{POA}}.\n*Based on her name, it can be presumed that she is of Indian descent.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{PS2 only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shah, Poonima}}\n[[pl:Poonima Shah]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
