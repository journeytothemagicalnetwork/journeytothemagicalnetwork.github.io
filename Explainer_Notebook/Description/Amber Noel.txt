She once signed up for [[Quidditch]] training at 7pm on Tuesday on a sign-up sheet that was posted on the [[Gryffindor Notice Board|bulletin board]] in the [[Gryffindor Common Room]].<ref>{{See image|File:QuidditchTrainingSignupSheet.jpg}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Amber\" comes from the English word amber that denotes either the gemstone, which is formed from fossil resin, or the orange-yellow colour. The word ultimately derives from Arabic \u0639\u0646\u0628\u0631 ('anbar). It began to be used as a given name in the late 19th century, but it only became popular after the release of Kathleen Winsor's novel 'Forever Amber' (1944).\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WWHP}} {{Mentioned on a poster}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Noel, Amber}}\n[[es:Amber Noel]]\n[[pl:Amber Noel]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Noel family]]\n[[Category:Quidditch players]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
