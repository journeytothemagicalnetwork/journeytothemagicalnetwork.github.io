[[1929]] \u2013 [[1981]]) was a [[wizardkind|wizard]] who was a world-renowned authority on [[Non-being|Non-Human Spirituous Apparitions]]. During the prelude to the [[First Wizarding War]], the [[Ministry of Magic]] called on his expertise of [[Dark Arts|Dark]] creatures to help contain the threat. He eventually joined the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]]. Lyall married [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Hope Howell]] and had one son, [[Remus Lupin|Remus John Lupin]], who was bitten by the [[werewolf]] [[Fenrir Greyback]] in retaliation for a negative comment about lycanthropes that Lyall made.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nLyall attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in his youth.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n\n===Marriage and career===\nBy the age of thirty, Lyall had become a world-renowned expert on Non-Human\u00a0Spiritous Apparition, which included [[poltergeist]]s and [[Boggart]]s.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n\nLyall went on an expedition to a remote [[Wales|Welsh]] woodland to investigate reports of a very fierce Boggart, and heard a woman scream. He rushed to her aid and banished the Boggart, [[Boggart-Banishing Spell|turning]] it into a [[field mushroom]] with a wave of his wand. The woman was [[Hope Howell]], a Muggle who worked for an insurance company in [[Cardiff]]. He tried to explain it was a Boggart, but she didn't understand so he acted like she had been confronted by a big and scary man. Afterward, he escorted her home wishing to ensure her safety.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n\nA few months later, he admitted to Hope that the Boggart had not posed any serious danger to her. This admission did not negatively impact her opinion of him, however \u2014 by this time the pair had fallen in [[love]]. Eventually, Lyall gathered the courage to propose and Hope accepted, enthusiastically committing herself to planning their nuptials. Their wedding took place in early [[1959]] and included a cake featuring a Boggart-shaped [[Wikipedia:wedding cake topper|topper]]. One year later on [[10 March]], [[1960]] the couple's first and only child, [[Remus Lupin|Remus John Lupin]] was born.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n\nBy the mid-[[1960s]], [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort's]] power was growing, and [[Death Eaters|his followers]] were recruiting a wide variety of Dark creatures to further his cause.<ref name=\"PM\" /> The [[Ministry of Magic]] called upon experts on Dark creatures in the hope of better understanding the threat and keeping it in check.<ref name=\"PM\" /> Lyall was asked to join the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]] and did so happily.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n\nAt some point during his career at the Ministry, Lyall got rid of the [[Screaming Bogey of Strathtully|Screaming Bogey]] of [[Strathtully]], a [[Boggart]] that had been feeding on the fears of local [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] to the point that it had become an elephantine black shadow with glowing white eyes, by trapping it in a matchbox.<ref name=\"Pottermore\">{{WW|boggart}}</ref>\n\n===Incurring a werewolf's wrath===\nIn early [[1965]], [[Fenrir Greyback]] was brought in for questioning at the Ministry of Magic following the deaths of two Muggle children. Although he was apparently caught with a [[werewolf]] pack, the Ministry was not aware that Greyback was himself a werewolf because the existing [[Werewolf Registry]] was not well-maintained. Greyback insisted to the questioning committee that he was only a Muggle tramp, which nearly all of the members fell for. Lyall, however, recognised characteristic signs of [[lycanthropy]] in Greyback's appearance and behaviour and voiced his concerns to the committee, recommending that Greyback be detained until the next full moon, which was only twenty-four hours away.\n\nRegardless, the other committee members ridiculed Lyall and he lost his temper, declaring werewolves to be \"soulless, evil, deserving nothing but death.\" Consequently, he was expelled from the room, and Greyback was released. While being seen out by a Ministry wizard, who intended to [[Memory Charm|erase his memory]] of having been brought in for questioning, Greyback escaped with the help of two accomplices.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n\nSoon after, Greyback hatched a plan to get revenge on Lyall for his derogatory remark.<ref name=\"PM\" /> Shortly before his son Remus's fifth birthday, Greyback forced open the boy's bedroom window and attacked him.<ref name=\"PM\" /> Lyall reached his son in time to save his life, repelling Greyback with powerful [[curse]]s, but Remus from then on had become a werewolf.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n\n===Raising a lycanthropic son===\nWith his son Remus becoming a werewolf, Lyall's perception for such individuals changed forever. Lyall and his wife tried all manner of treatments for their son's lycanthropy, but in those days, before [[Damocles Belby|Damocles]]'s invention of the [[Wolfsbane Potion]], there were none that were actually effective.<ref name=\"poa18\">{{POA|B|18}}</ref> Thus, the couple was forced to take drastic measures to conceal Remus's condition, moving to a new village or town whenever their neighbours began to take notice of the boy's strange behaviour.<ref name=\"PM\" /> They forbade Remus from playing with other children, and consequently, despite having the love of both his parents, his early childhood was marked by loneliness.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n\nInitially, Lyall was able to keep Remus under control during the full moon by placing him in a locked room and casting several [[Silencing Charm]]s, but as the child grew, he became more difficult to contain.<ref name=\"PM\" /> By the time he was ten, Remus was capable of knocking down doors and breaking windows during his monthly transformation, requiring Lyall to use ever more powerful spells.<ref name=\"PM\" /> Lyall and his wife grew thin worrying for their son, whom they loved dearly, knowing that the [[wizarding world|wizarding community]] would react severely if they learned of the existence of an uncontrolled werewolf.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n\nThe Lupins feared their son would not be able to attend [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] due to his condition.<ref name=\"PM\" /><ref name=\"poa18\" /> Lyall tried to provide his son with a [[magic]]al education at home as a result.<ref name=\"PM\" /> However, shortly before Remus's eleventh birthday in [[1971]], [[Albus Dumbledore]], the [[Headmaster]] of Hogwarts, showed up unannounced at the Lupins' door. The couple tried frantically to prevent him from entering their home, but their magical defences, although strong enough to keep their werewolf son from getting out of control, were useless in front of the greatest wizard of the time and he easily entered their house without them realising it until five minutes later when Dumbledore played Gobstones with their son.<ref name=\"PM\" /> Dumbledore told the couple that he knew of how their son had been attacked by Fenrir Greyback (Greyback had boasted of his actions to spies that Dumbledore had planted among the Dark creatures).<ref name=\"PM\" /> He assured them that Remus would be able to attend Hogwarts, since he had already seen to it that the boy would have a safe, secure location to spend his monthly transformations.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n===Later life===\nSometime prior to Voldemort's fall on [[31 October]], [[1981]], Hope died, leaving Lyall a widower.<ref name=\"PM\" /> Although Remus was unable to find stable employment to support himself following the end of the [[First Wizarding War]], he refused to move back home with Lyall, fearing that doing so would threaten his father's \"peaceful\" life.<ref name=\"PM\" /> However, he still saw Lyall from time to time, which made his father happy.<ref name=\"PM\" /> Eventually, Remus died in the [[Second Wizarding War]], leaving Lyall with only a [[Edward Lupin|grandson]], though whether Lyall was dead by [[1998]] or whether he ever met his grandson is unknown.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nLyall was described as a shy and clever man.<ref name=\"PM\" /> Though usually mild-mannered, he had a hidden fierce temper which could assert itself when he was sufficiently upset by a situation, and was not afraid to challenge his professional superiors when he knew them to be in the wrong on an important matter.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n\nThough he did not bear any prejudice against [[Non-magic people|Muggles]], he subscribed to the negative view of [[werewolf|werewolves]] that was prevalent in the wizarding community, until his eyes were opened when his own son was left a werewolf as a result of an attack carried out in retaliation for an anti-werewolf remark he made.<ref name=\"PM\" /> Presumably, his beliefs on werewolves changed once his son was infected, given Remus became a caring individual, not evil and soulless like Lyall believed werewolves to be. Lyall proved himself to be a devoted father who loved his son unconditionally and was willing to go to great lengths to protect him despite his condition.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n\nLyall sometimes found it difficult to reveal things to people if he thought it would make them think less of him. He refrained from telling Hope that the [[Boggart]] wasn't a real danger for several months after meeting her, presumably because he didn't want her to think that he had simply been playing the hero to try to win her affections.<ref name=\"PM\" /> He also refrained from telling Remus the true circumstances of his attack and the identity of his attacker for many years out of fear of his son's condemnation.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n{{Quote|Lyall reached the bedroom in time to save his son's life, driving Greyback out of the house with a number of powerful curses.|Lyall's attack on Greyback|Pottermore}}\n*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Lyall was skilled in defensive magic, as he was able to trap the [[Screaming Bogey of Strathtully]] inside a matchbox, something few other wizards would do, with him being proficient with the casting of the [[Boggart-Banishing Spell]]. Lyall also proved himself to be fairly talented with [[martial magic]], as seen when he fended off the savage [[werewolf]] [[Fenrir Greyback]] with multiple powerful [[curse]]s during a full [[moon]].<ref name=\"PM\" />\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Lyall also proved to be acceptable in regard to charms, using [[Unbreakable Charm]]s and [[Silencing Charm]]s to keep his son quiet and safe during the full moon.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n*''\"Lyall\"'' may be from a Scottish surname which was derived from the Old Norse given name \"''Liulfr\"'' (which was derived in part from \"''\u00falfr\"'', meaning \"wolf\"). \"''Lyall\"'' is also a common surname (most common in America).\n*\"''Lupin''\" is derived from \"''lupus (/lupa)''\", Latin for \"wolf\". ''Lupin'' thus means \"wolf-like\" in Latin, and is also the name of a flower. \"''Canis lupus\"'' is the scientific name for wolf. To be described as \"lupine\" means to \"resemble a wolf\". This alludes to\u00a0[[werewolf|lycanthropy]]. The surname may also be derived from the character of Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, a fictional\u00a0gentleman thief\u00a0and master of disguise, who was created by French writer\u00a0Maurice Leblanc in 1905. In Leblanc's novels, Ars\u00e8ne Lupin is often a force for good, while operating on the wrong side of the law. Leblanc's Lupin was said to have later inspired the character of \"the Lone Wolf\",\u00a0a jewel thief-turned-private detective in a series of novels written by Louis Joseph Vance, beginning in 1914.\n*Though more difficult to confirm, a character named Lawrence 'Larry' Talbot was the title character in Universal Films' 'The Wolf Man' series, afflicted in much the same way as Remus and in his case (initially) reluctantly killed by the father who once sought to protect him. 'Larry' to 'Lyall' could be the author filtering this name through the naming conventions of the Wizarding World. In addition, a prominent actor of the same bygone era was named Lyle Talbot.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*It is possible that Lyall worked in the [[Spirit Division]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA}} {{1st Mention}}\n*{{HBP}} {{Mention}}\n*{{PM}} {{1st ID}} {{Mention}}\n*{{WW}} {{Mention}}\n*{{WU}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lupin, Lyall}}\n[[de:Lyall Lupin]]\n[[fr:Lyall Lupin]]\n[[pl:Lyall Lupin]]\n[[ru:\u041b\u0430\u0439\u0435\u043b\u043b \u041b\u044e\u043f\u0438\u043d]]\n[[pt-br:Lyall Lupin]]\n[[Category:Articles related to werewolves]]\n[[Category:British individuals]]\n[[Category:Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures personnel]]\n[[Category:Howell family]]\n[[Category:Lupin family|Lyall]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Widowed individuals]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
