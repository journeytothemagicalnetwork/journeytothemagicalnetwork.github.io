Sage Bragnam, magical historian, at your service.|Sage Bragnam|Fantastic Beasts: Cases from the Wizarding World}}\n'''Sage Bragnam''' was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[wizardkind|wizard]] and a [[magic]]al historian specialising in examining artefacts and [[rune]]s; he worked in the capacity of Head Curator of the [[Department of Magical Artefacts]] at the [[British Ministry of Magic]].<ref name=\"WU\">{{WU}} (see [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-1-foundables-spell this])</ref>\n\nHe assisted the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]] with expert opinion during their investigations related to [[magic]]al [[beast]]s.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiIdj3X6w1E Youtube - FANTASTIC BEASTS Cases From The Wizarding World iOS / Android Gameplay HD]</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n=== Early life ===\nBorn into a family of unverified magical pedigree, Sage Bragham was born in [[Scotland]] and attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] during his formative years where he was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw|Ravenclaw House]].<ref name=\":0\">{{FBC|8}}</ref> He was a good student, and took a particular interest in more theoretical studies, such as [[History of Magic]] and the [[Study of Ancient Runes]], both of which he would later specialise in as an adult. He was also known to have studied [[Arithmancy]].\n\n=== Career ===\nIn adulthood, Sage became an accomplished magical historian, specialising in examining magical artefacts and the interpretation of [[rune]]s. Eventually, he found employment at the [[British Ministry of Magic]], where he was hired by the Ministry's [[Ministry of Magic research wing|research wing]] and assigned to the [[Department of Magical Artefacts]], where he would eventually rise to the position of [[Head Curator]]. Due to his knowledge on magical creatures, he would also occasionally be called on to assist with the investigations into creature-related incidents by the [[Beast Division]] in the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Having held onto his old house tie, at some point, he placed it in his office.<ref name=\":0\" /> An avid [[Quidditch]] fan, he was a strong supporter of the [[England|English]] team [[Tutshill Tornados]], owning a souvenir programme signed by no less a person than the famed [[seeker]] [[Roderick Plumpton]] himself.<ref name=\":1\">{{FBC|5}}</ref> He eventually also found himself becoming a slightly reclusive activist in the [[Witches' Holistic Institute for Friends of Fairies]], of which only he and [[Winifred Whittle]] were members.\n\nSometime later, a [[research assistant]] at the [[Auror Office]] by the name of [[Grim Fawley]] greatly ran through and successfully transcribed an ancient tome that had, until that moment, proven too difficult to translate. Greatly impressed by the man's skill in rune translation and ancient languages, Mr. Bragnam, who decided that he were being wasted with the [[Aurors]], tried to have him transferred to his own department; only to learn, to his dismay, that [[Penelope Fawley|his wife]] had already persuaded him to pursue a career as an [[Unspeakable]] in the [[Department of Mysteries]].<ref name=\":3\">{{WU}} (Registry: Exploration - Chapter 2: Grim Fawley - Ministry Record)</ref> \n\nAfter five prominent members of the magical community in [[Great Britain]] went mysteriously missing in [[2015]], Mr. Bragnam lent his expertise to the efforts being made to find them by joining the council that oversaw the search lead by the Head of the [[Auror Office]], [[Harry Potter|Harry Potter.]].<ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{WU}} (Registry: Exploration - Chapter 1: Grim Fawley - Motives)</ref> After several months without any results, even after the lead Auror on the case had even borrowed creatures from the [[Magizoologist]] [[Mathilda Grimblehawk]] in the [[Beast Division]], the Ministry came under a lot of pressure to find them. Still and all, it would take at least a couple of years before the Ministry decided to hold a Public Hearing to discuss a motion to terminate the [[London Five]] investigation; during which [[Grim Fawley]], the husband of one of the missing individuals; made a stirring speech where he urged the Ministry to keep the investigation open. By then, however, the whole investigation became a very involved and political affair, and after the Aurors failed to come up with any evidence regarding their whereabouts, the council finally determined that it was time to close the investigation, with Sage himself later noting that there was numerous unseen reason behind the decision.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Physical appearance==\nSage had short reddish-brown hair with a fairly large bushy beard, with brown eyes and white skin. He often wore a brightly coloured striped scarf with a beige coat.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nSage was a fairly sociable individual, and was friendly with many of his colleagues and co-workers, such as [[Mathilda Grimblehawk]] and [[Mathilda Grimblehawk's partner|her partner]], and was always happy to help them if called upon to do so, having more than once been called in for consultation by the [[Beast Division]] during investigations into creature-related incidents, once even agreeing to go through the entire accounts ledger from [[Slug & Jiggers Apothecary]] in [[Diagon Alley]] for them.<ref name=\":1\" /> He had a very dry sense of humour, being amused by bad puns relating to the objects he was called in to examine and proved himself to be open-minded, as seen by how, rather than being prejudiced against non-wizards, on the contrary was rather fascinated by the creative ingenuity of [[Non-magic people|Muggles]].<ref name=\":2\" /> A compassionate man, he proved himself to have a vested interest in the well-being of his peers, telling Grimblehawk to be careful while she was looking for dangerous creatures.<ref name=\":2\">{{FBC}}</ref> He was also a man of action, at least to the extent where he was wiling to go to great lengths to help bring a resolution to catastrophe, as shown when he joined the council tasked with overseeing the investigation into the [[London Five]].\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[History of Magic]]''': An authority in [[History of Magic]], Sage was often called upon to use his expertise to help shred light on obscure findings during the investigations during his time in working with [[Mathilda Grimblehawk]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n*'''[[Study of Ancient Runes]]''': Specialising on the study and examination of [[rune]]s, Sage was very well versed and knowledgeable in the study of Runology, and hence often called upon to able to interpret or translate complex runic scriptures, alphabets and symbols found in the field during investigations.<ref name=\":2\" />\n*'''[[Magizoology]]''': According to [[Magizoologist]] [[Mathilda Grimblehawk]], Sage possessed a \"profound\" knowledge on magical creatures, and was often called upon to examine everything from claw marks to bits and bobs of magical creatures found during the course of the investigations of the [[Beast Division]], and once successfully identified a feather retrieved from such a scene as that of a Golden Eagle rather than a magical creature.<ref name=\":2\" />\n*'''[[Healing magic]]''': Sage was also proficient with medical spells and brews, as he was sometimes set to not only examine the creatures brought back to the Ministry in the wake of [[Beast Division|beast]]-related investigations, but also treated their injuries and saw to it that they were relocated somewhere on a safe distance from [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] afterwards.\n*'''[[Arithmancy]]''': A former student of the [[Arithmancy (class)|subject]] at Hogwarts and a professional [[Arithmancer]] in his adult life, he was known to have utilise his knowledge and expertise in the field to figure out number-related conundrums, such as the accounts ledger from [[Slug & Jiggers Apothecary]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n*'''Knowledge of [[Magical Law]]''': Sage was able to ascertain that nothing [[Bilius Finbok]] had purchased from [[Slug & Jiggers Apothecary]] was illegal or could be used to make something illegal, showing he had a strong understanding of Magical Law and the various applications it cut across the [[Wizarding world]] and with [[Wizardkind]].\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Sage Bragnam}}\n*{{FBC}} {{1st}}\n*{{WU}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Arithmancy}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bragnam, Sage}}\n[[es:Sage Bragnam]]\n[[fr:Sage Bragnam]]\n[[pl:Sage Bragnam]]\n[[ru:\u0421\u044d\u0439\u0434\u0436 \u0411\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043d\u0430\u043c]]\n[[Category:Activists]]\n[[Category:Arithmancers]]\n[[Category:Brown-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Historians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ministry of Magic employees]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Scottish individuals]]\n[[Category:Tutshill Tornados supporters]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
