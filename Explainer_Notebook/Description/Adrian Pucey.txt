[[1977]]\u2013[[1979]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who likely began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1989]] or [[1990]]. He was a member of [[Slytherin]] house, and was a [[Chaser]] on the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]].<ref name=\"PS11\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Adrian.jpg|thumb|left|Marcus, Adrian and Draco before a Quidditch Match]]\nAdrian Pucey likely began attending Hogwarts School in 1989 or 1990. He was sorted into the house of [[Slytherin]] and made it onto the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] and he played the role of Chaser.<ref name=\"PS11\">{{PS|B|11}}</ref>\n\nAdrian was on the [[Slytherin]] team in [[Harry Potter]]'s first year up to and including his fifth year (except for the third year, when [[Marcus Flint]], [[Cassius Warrington]] and [[Graham Montague]] are said to be the three chasers); hence, he was no more than two years ahead of Harry, assuming that he did not need to repeat a year, like Marcus Flint. He was notable for being one of the few Slytherin Quidditch players who was not seen to commit a foul or otherwise cheat, despite being on the Quidditch team for at least three years.<ref name=\"PS11\"/>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Adrian Pucey was played by [[Scot Fearn]] in the first two films, but due to a series of errors in the closing credits of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Philosopher's Stone]],'' he was listed as having played [[Terence Higgs]] (his name was additionally misspelled as \"Scott Fern\" therein), while [[David Holmes]] was wrongly credited as Pucey and [[Will Theakston]] (Higgs) as Marcus Flint.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241527/fullcredits#cast IMDb: ''Philosopher's Stone'' Credits]</ref> These errors were corrected in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Chamber of Secrets]]'', though both Fearn's and Jamie Yeates' names contained spelling errors.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0295297/fullcredits#cast IMDb: ''Chamber of Secrets'' Credits]</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n*The name {{W|Adrian}} is derived from the Roman name ''Hadrian'', who was an emperor of Rome who gave his name to Hadrian's Wall in England. Adrian means \"from Adria\", a port on the Adriatic Sea, and was the regnal name of the first and only English pope, Adrian IV.\n*Pucey may be from puce, a deep red to dark greyish purple, and from the French word for \"flea\".\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Adrian Pucey}}\n*{{PS}} {{1st}}\n*{{PS|F}}\n*{{COS}}\n*{{COS|F}}\n*{{COS|G}}<ref>Although Adrian is never identified, the complete Slytherin Quidditch team appeared in the game adaptation.</ref>\n*{{POA}}\n*{{OOTP}}\n*{{PM}} {{Mention}}\n*{{QWC}}\n*{{HPV|CH}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pucey, Adrian}}\n{{Character-stub}}\n[[de:Adrian Pucey]]\n[[es:Adrian Pucey]]\n[[fr:Adrian Pucey]]\n[[it:Adrian Pucey]]\n[[ru:\u042d\u0434\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043d \u041f\u044c\u044e\u0441\u0438]]\n[[pl:Adrian Pucey]]\n[[pt-br:Adrian Pucey]]\n[[de2:Adrian Pucey]]\n[[Category:1970s births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Chasers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1989]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
