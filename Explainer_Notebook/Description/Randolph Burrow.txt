He was a [[Chaser]] on the [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team]] during the [[1993\u20131994 school year]].<ref name=\"QWC\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n*From the Germanic elements ''rand'' meaning \"rim (of a shield)\" and ''wulf'' meaning \"wolf\". The Normans brought this name to England, where there existed already an Old Norse cognate ''Rand\u00falfr'', which had been introduced by Scandinavian settlers. Randolf became rare after the Middle Ages, though it was revived in the 18th century (usually in the spelling ''Randolph'').\n*A burrow is a hole or tunnel dug in the ground by a small animal, such as a rabbit or mole, for habitation or refuge.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{QWC}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burrow, Randolph}}\n[[de:Randolph Burrow]]\n[[es:Randolph Burrow]]\n[[fr:Randolph Burrow]]\n[[pl:Randolph Burrow]]\n[[ru:\u0420\u044d\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0444 \u0411\u0430\u0440\u0440\u043e\u0443]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Chasers]]\n[[Category:Green-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
