He was described by [[Ginevra Weasley]] as ''\"an idiot\"''. During the [[1996\u20131997 school year]], he was the reserve [[Seeker]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]], and played against [[Gryffindor]] when [[Draco Malfoy]] pulled out of the squad.<ref name=\"HBP14\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nHarper was born in the early [[1980s]].\n\nIn the early [[1990s]], Harper began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Slytherin]] by the [[Sorting Hat]], and was shown to share the beliefs of his peers.<ref name=\"HBP14\"/>\n\nIn [[1996]], he became a [[Seeker]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]]. He was a dirty player, deliberately ramming the opposing Seeker [[Harry Potter]] during the first [[Quidditch]] match of [[1996]] and making snide comments about [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. He quickly spotted the [[Golden Snitch]] before Harry did, possibly because Harry was furious about [[Zacharias Smith]] and he was distracted. However, when it seemed that he was about to catch it, he was put off by Harry's desperate taunt, implying that [[Draco Malfoy]] had paid Harper to play instead. Harper, in his distraction, fumbled the Snitch, costing his team the game.<ref name=\"HBP14\">{{HBP|B|14}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nHarper appeared to share the [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood supremacist]] beliefs of fellow [[Slytherin]]s, as shown by his snide comments about [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] being a [[blood traitor]]. He also lacked good sportsmanship and took part in foul play, deliberately ramming Harry Potter during the first [[Quidditch]] match of [[1996]].<ref name=\"HBP14\"/>\n\n==Magical skills and abilities==\n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': As a [[Quidditch]] player, Harper was a reasonably proficient [[broomstick]] flyer. Harper appeared to have a keen eyesight, spotting the Snitch before even [[Harry Potter]] did, but being unable to catch it first.<ref name=\"HBP14\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{HBP}} {{1st}}\n*{{HBP|F}} {{C|Cut from the final edit}}\n*{{HBP|G}}<ref>The Slytherin Seeker which Harry plays against is unnamed, but can be assumed to be Harper.</ref>\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=[[Draco Malfoy]]\n|position=[[Seeker]] of the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]]\n|years=[[1996]]\n|successor=Unknown\n}}\n{{End box}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n[[de:Harper]]\n[[es:Harper]]\n[[fr:Harper]] \n[[pl:Harper]]\n[[ru:\u0425\u0430\u0440\u043f\u0435\u0440]]\n[[Category:1980s births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pure-blood supremacists]]\n[[Category:Seekers]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1992]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
