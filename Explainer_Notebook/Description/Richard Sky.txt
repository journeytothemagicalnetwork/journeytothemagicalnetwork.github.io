He once signed up for [[Quidditch]] training at 7pm on Thursday on a sign-up sheet that was posted on the [[Gryffindor Notice Board|bulletin board]] in the [[Gryffindor Common Room]].<ref>{{See image|File:QuidditchTrainingSignupSheet.jpg}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Richard\" means \"brave power\", derived from the Germanic elements ric \"power, rule\" and hard \"brave, hardy\". The Normans introduced this name to Britain, and it has been very common there since that time. It was borne by three kings of England including Richard I the Lionheart, leader of the Third Crusade in the [[12th century]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WWHP}} {{Mentioned on a poster}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sky, Richard}}\n[[es:Richard Sky]]\n[[pl:Richard Sky]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Quidditch players]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
