[[1979]]-[[1980]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]], though she may not have stayed for her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] year.<ref>During a practical examination of their O.W.L.s, Sally-Anne was not called to take her test. In alphabetical order, she would have appeared after the Patil twins but before Harry Potter.</ref> She was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] right before [[Harry Potter]] and was either sorted into [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]], or [[Slytherin]] house.<ref name=\"PS7\"/>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Although Sally-Anne Perks was in the same year as Harry in {{PS}}, there is no other mention of her in the [[Harry Potter (book series)|series]].\n**However, she may be the [[Bespectacled Slytherin girl|unidentified bespectacled girl]] or one of the unnamed Gryffindor girls in Harry's year, in {{PS|F}}. It is also possible that she was one of the two un-named Hufflepuff girls in Harry's year, since only [[Susan Bones]], [[Hannah Abbott]] and [[Megan Jones]] were mentioned to be sorted into Hufflepuff.\n*Sally-Anne Perks was not called to take her test for a practical examination in the [[1996]] [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]]. Her turn should have come after the [[Padma and Parvati Patil|Patil twins]] but before [[Harry Potter]]. This could just be a mistake of [[J. K. Rowling]], or Sally-Anne may have been unable to attend her test. She could also have repeated one or more years, which would make her a fourth or younger year while Harry was in his fifth year.\n*The option for Perks as a family name for the protagonist of {{FBC}} suggests Sally-Anne may have been a [[half-blood]] or a [[pure-blood]].\n===Translations===\n*Afrikaans: ''Wolfgang Petzel''\n*Dutch: ''Sally Pekel''\n*Hebrew: ''\u05e1\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9-\u05d0\u05df \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7\u05e1''\n*Italian: ''Sally Anne Gaius''\n*Japanese: ''\u30b5\u30ea\u30fc-\u30a2\u30f3\u30fb\u30d1\u30fc\u30af\u30b9 {{c|Sar\u012ban P\u0101kusu}}''\n*Lithuanian: ''Seli Ana Perks''\n*Norwegian: ''Anna-Klara Pomp''\n*Portuguese (Brazil): ''Sara Perks''\n*Russian: ''\u0421\u0430\u043b\u043b\u0438-\u042d\u043d\u043d \u041f\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0441 {{c|Salli-Enn Perks}}''\n*Serbian: ''\u0421\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0415\u043d \u041f\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0441 {{c|Sali En Perks}}''\n*Slovak: ''Sally-Anne Perksov\u00e1''\n*Welsh: ''Siriol Pennant''\n\nThe following languages are the same as the original:\n{|\n|\n*Danish\n*Faroese\n|\n*French\n*German\n|\n*Latin\n*Portuguese\n|\n*Swedish\n|}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{PS}} {{1st Mention}}\n*{{HPM}} {{Mention}}\n*{{PM}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Perks, Sally-Anne}}\n[[de:Sally-Anne Perks]]\n[[fr:Sally-Anne Perks]]\n[[it:Sally-Anne Perks]]\n[[pl:Sally\u2212Anne Perks]]\n[[ru:\u0421\u0430\u043b\u043b\u0438-\u042d\u043d\u043d \u041f\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0441]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1991]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
