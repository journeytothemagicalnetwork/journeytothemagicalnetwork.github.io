[[1978]]/[[1979]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and a [[Gryffindor]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1990]] to [[1997]]. She was a [[Chaser]] for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. During her Hogwarts years, she became incredibly close friends with [[Angelina Johnson]] and [[Alicia Spinnet]], who were Gryffindors from the year above her. \n\nIn her [[sixth year]], she joined [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation taught and led by [[Harry Potter]]. During her seventh year, she was tortured by a cursed [[Opal Necklace]] and recovered at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]].\n\nKatie left Hogwarts in 1997, but returned in [[1998]], in order to fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]. Katie survived the [[Second Wizarding War]] and her later life is currently unknown.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n\nKatie was born in [[1978]] or [[1979]] in [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]]. She lived with her parents in an unknown place.<ref>{{HBP|B|24}} - \"I had a couple of days at home with Mum and Dad\"</ref>\n\n===Hogwarts years {{C|1990-1997}}===\n====First year====\nKatie Bell started her [[magic]]al education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1990]].

Before any practise actually took place, the team was removed from the pitch by the [[Slytherin]] team, whom stated that they needed the pitch in order to train their new Seeker. Katie was then witness to [[Draco Malfoy]] calling [[Hermione Granger]] a [[Mudblood]], a term which shocked and angered her.<ref name=\"COS7\">{{COS|B|7}}</ref>\n\nShe also was a member of the [[Duelling Club]] and she attended the first gathering with Alicia and Angelina.

During practise, Wood commented on his chasers playing \"superbly\". Gryffindor had originally planned to play Slytherin first, but due to Draco Malfoy's injury, they faced the [[Hufflepuff Quidditch team|Hufflepuff team]] instead, captained by [[Cedric Diggory]]. When Wood spoke of the Hufflepuff Captain Cedric, Katie, Angelina and Alicia started giggling and commented on Cedric's good looks. The game itself did not go too well, as the players struggled against the terrible weather, and Harry, Gryffindor's Seeker, had passed out in the presence of a [[Dementor]] and fell from his broom, leaving Cedric to catch the Snitch and Gryffindor to lose the match.<ref name=\"POA9\">{{POA|B|9}}</ref> Katie was also present the night that [[Sirius Black]] successfully [[Sirius Black's break-in of Hogwarts Castle (1993)|broke into]] [[Gryffindor Tower]] ([[31 October]], [[Hallowe'en]]), she was most likely very much shocked by the incident, along with her fellow Gryffindors.<ref name=\"POA8\">{{POA|B|8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Harry Potter Pottermore Harry Holding Quidditch Cup In A Crowd Moment.jpg|250px|thumb|Gryffindor wins the Quidditch Cup in 1994]]\n{{Quote|Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession \u2014 no! \u2014 [[Gryffindor]] back in possession and it\u2019s Katie Bell, Katie Bell for Gryffindor with the Quaffle, she\u2019s streaking up the pitch \u2014 ''THAT WAS DELIBERATE''!|Slytherin deliberately fouls Katie| Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}\nKatie and her team later played [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team|Ravenclaw]], and she scored the first goal and soon after Gryffindor were up by eighty points. Ravenclaw started to make a comeback but Harry caught the Snitch, and Katie kissed Harry on the cheek afterwards. The final match of the season, against Slytherin, was loaded with brutal play, and when Gryffindor was up by twenty points, [[Graham Montague]] had gripped Katie's hair and made her do a cartwheel in the air; she managed to stay on her broom but lost possession of the [[Quaffle]]. As a result, [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] awarded Katie a penalty and she scored. Gryffindor won the match and the Quidditch Cup.<ref name=\"POA15\">{{POA|B|15}}</ref> At the end of Katie's fourth year, she and her fellow players would bid farewell to Wood as he graduated from Hogwarts.\n\n====Fifth year====\n{{Quote|You'll be able to pay back Diggory for that last Quidditch match, Harry!|Katie's enthusiasm over Harry as Triwizard champion|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\n\nIn Katie's [[fifth year]], all Quidditch games had been cancelled due to the school hosting the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. When Harry was selected as the fourth champion, alongside Cedric Diggory, [[Fleur Delacour]] of the [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]], and [[Viktor Krum]] of the [[Durmstrang Institute]], Katie, like all the Gryffindors, was ecstatic. She was thrilled that Harry could pay Hufflepuff back for losing against them in their previous year by beating Cedric.<ref name=\"GOF17\">{{GOF|B|17}}</ref> Harry won the Triwizard Cup, but no one expressed happiness, as the school was in mourning over the death of Cedric Diggory.

We can take off his name and put yours on instead....|Katie angrily to Ron Weasley|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\nIn Katie's [[sixth year]], Angelina was named the new Gryffindor Quidditch captain and was no less demanding than Wood had been. During the term, Hogwarts was under inspection from [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor|High Inquisitor]] [[Dolores Umbridge]], who had a disliking for Harry and put him in detention several times, disrupting the Gryffindors' Quidditch practice schedule. During one training session, Keeper [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] passed the Quaffle to Katie rather quickly, causing it to hit her square in the face. [[Fred Weasley]] passed her a small purple something from his pocket to staunch the resulting nosebleed, but it actually increased the blood loss to the point that the practice session was cancelled and Katie was taken to the hospital wing by the twins.<ref name=\"OOTP13\">{{OOTP|B|13}}</ref> Later on in the year, Hogwarts was under rebellion from both students and staff alike.\n\n[[File:Dumbledore's Army in circle.JPG|250x250px|thumb|left|A Dumbledore's Army meeting]] \n\nIn an attempt to defy Dolores Umbridge, Harry, with the help of Hermione, set up an organisation called [[Dumbledore's Army]], where students could practise how to defend themselves in a practical manner.

However, she missed out on the position of Gryffindor [[Quidditch]] Captain, which instead went to Harry instead. When Harry held try-outs, Katie told Harry that she did not wish him to favour her because she was an old player, but to hold a fair trial and not put friendship first. Which made Ron very uncomfortable, as he was Harry's best friend. Katie managed to keep the position of Chaser, working alongside newcomers [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] and [[Demelza Robins]].<ref name=\"HBP11\">{{HBP|B|11}}</ref>\n\n[[File:B6C12M1 Cursed Katie Bell.jpg|251x251px|thumb|Katie being subjected to the curse on the opal necklace in Hogsmeade]]\n\nOn the [[12 October]],<ref>Hogsmeade visits only happen on weekends. According to {{HBP|B|12}}, the first trip in 1996 was \"in the middle of October\".

Hogsmeade trips are only known to take place on Saturdays meaning it has to be the 12th.</ref> while on a trip to [[Hogsmeade]], Katie was put under the [[Imperius Curse]] by the [[Three Broomsticks Inn|Three Broomsticks]] innkeeper, [[Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]] (herself under the Imperius Curse by [[Draco Malfoy]]). Katie was made to take a [[curse]]d [[Opal Necklace]], which she found inside the girls' bathroom, to Dumbledore in an assassination attempt. However, as she argued with her friend [[Leanne]], the package ripped and Katie came in contact with the necklace. Fortunately, as she had only touched it through a small hole in her glove, it only caused her terrible pain and not [[death]]. She was sent to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] and spent six months recovering.<ref name=\"HBP12\">{{HBP|B|12}}</ref> After being discharged from [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]], she spent a couple of days at her [[Bell family home|home]] with her parents before returning back to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].<ref name=\"HBP24\">{{HBP|B|24}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alicia_&_harry_hbp.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry talking to Katie after her return from [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]]]]\n\n[[Dean Thomas]] temporarily replaced her as Chaser but she was healthy enough to return for the final against Ravenclaw and helped Gryffindor win the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]] for the third time since she was on the team. Harry questioned Katie on whether she had any recollection of who had given her the necklace, which she did not. However, Malfoy, who was responsible for the incident, overheard their conversation and believed she had actually implicated him, and therefore fled into the girls' bathroom to hide from Harry, who eventually cast ''[[Sectumsempra]]'' on Malfoy in the washroom in self-defence from Draco's attempted [[Cruciatus Curse]].<ref name=\"HBP24\">{{HBP|B|24}}</ref>\n\n====Repeat year====\n{{Quote|Your efforts are futile.

On the way back to school, she witnessed the [[Death Eaters]] [[Raid on the Hogwarts Express|raid]] the [[Hogwarts Express]], [[Plot to kill Harry Potter|seeking]] Harry Potter.<ref>{{DH|F1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, at the height of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Katie, being of age, fought in the Battle of Hogwarts against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his army of [[Death Eaters]]. Katie reunited with Oliver, Alicia, and Angelina at Hogwarts. During the first stage of the battle, she was seen fighting alongside [[Aberforth Dumbledore]], [[Seamus Finnigan]], and [[Leanne]].<ref name=\"DH31\">{{DH|B|31}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Padma_Leanne_Katie_Cho.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Katie, [[Padma Patil]], [[Cho Chang]], and [[Leanne]] in the Great Hall after the battle]]\n\nThe battle was called to a halt when Voldemort asked that Harry Potter surrender and come to him in the [[Forbidden Forest]], or else he would enter the battle and destroy all the defenders of Hogwarts.

She was also kind and gentle. [[Harry Potter]] once noted, that off the [[Quidditch]] pitch she wouldn't hurt a fly. She had a good sense of fairness, acknowledging that Harry deserved the title of [[Quidditch Captain]] over herself with no resentment. She also encouraged him not to automatically give her a spot on the team without first trying out, as their could be better candidates than her. Furthermore, she disliked those who had a [[pure-blood]] obsession. Katie believed that there were no differences between [[pure-blood]]s and [[Muggle-born]]s, as she became particularly angry when Malfoy called [[Hermione Granger]] a \"[[Mudblood]]\", showing her to be very tolerant of individuals of different [[blood status]]es.  \n\nKatie was also brave and determined, since she was sorted into Gryffindor house and was a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], in order to oppose [[Dolores Umbridge]]. She also courageously fought alongside fellow D.A. members during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], opposing various [[Death Eaters]] and even ended up surviving the battle, showing her immense loyalty and dedication to defending her school.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n{{Quote|We've got three superb [[Chaser]]s.|[[Angelina Johnson]], Katie, and [[Alicia Spinnet]] Quidditch skills|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban }}\n\n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Katie played the position of Chaser on the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], indicating that she was a very skilled [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player. She also understood that good Quidditch teams could been ruined due to Captains letting in their friends or playing the old faces, and wanted Harry to not fall into that, showing her very strong dedication to success in this field. Despite this she was able to secure her spot on the team, proving that she was indeed a highly skilled flyer and Chaser.\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': Katie learned how to duel at the [[Duelling Club]] in her third year.<ref name=\"COSF\"/> She was also taught various offensive and defensive spells while attending the meetings of [[Dumbledore's Army]], under Harry Potter's excellent teaching.<ref name=\"OOTP18\"/> Katie along with many other Hogwarts students fought bravely in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against Voldemort's army and survived,<ref name=\"DHF2\"/> showing her to be a very skilled duellist indeed with a talent for [[martial magic]].  \n*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Katie was proficient with transfiguration, a very difficult and complex branch of [[magic]], as she took the [[Transfiguration (class)|subject]] at [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level,<ref name=\"HBP24\"/> meaning she must have achieved either an \"[[Outstanding]]\" or \"[[Exceeds Expectations]]\" in her transfiguration [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]]. \n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Katie was able to conjure a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]],<ref name=\"LEGOY2\"/> which is a mark of superior [[magic]]al ability, given the immense difficulty of casting such an advanced and powerful protective charm.

There, she became best friends with fellow members [[Angelina Johnson]] and [[Alicia Spinnet]], who were both a year older than her. Katie, Alicia and Angelina were also the only girls on the team and the three were rarely seen out of one another's company; in 1992, they attended the first meeting of the Duelling Club together and were often seen chatting to one another in the common room. Upon Angelina and Alicia's leaving school, Katie befriended a girl named Leanne.\n\nShe was also a good friend of the twins [[Fred and George Weasley]]. Fred and George liked doing pranks and teasing the others, but defended their friends. When Fred and George were kicked off from the team by [[Dolores Umbridge]], Katie was angry with them, as their loss at the team would cost them the Quidditch Cup.\n\nAnother friend of hers was Lee Jordan. Although he wasn't a member of the team, he was the Quidditch match commentator, and strongly supported the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Lee liked doing pranks, too.\n\nKatie was also a close friend of Oliver Wood, the captain of the team. However, they argued several times, and Katie thought Oliver wanted to win the Quidditch cup \"too much\".\n\nOther members of the team were [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. Harry, the [[Seeker]], was extremely good, but Ron had a lack of confidence, due to the [[Slytherin]]s making fun of him. Eventually, Ron was proved to be very good, as the members of the team supported him and advised him not to be bothered by the Slytherins. She was also a good friend of Harry, and was happy for him when he became Captain. Katie also became a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], in order to be taught [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] by Harry, and she later fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], alongside Harry and the other members of the team. Furthermore, when Katie was tortured by the [[Opal Necklace]], Harry helped save her, by calling [[Rubeus Hagrid]]. He also wanted to learn who gave the necklace to Katie, but she wasn't able to recall it.\n\n===Dumbledore's Army===\n[[File:Dumbledore's_Army.jpg|234x234px|thumb|[[Dumbledore's Army]]]] \nKatie became a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]] in her sixth year. It was an organisation founded by [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]], and led by Harry, in order to teach students [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] and oppose [[Dolores Umbridge]].\n\nKatie was a friend of [[Hermione Granger]], a [[Gryffindor]] girl who was a year younger than her. Katie and the other girls from the Gryffindor Quidditch team were angered when [[Draco Malfoy]] called Hermione a \"[[Mudblood]].\" When Katie was tortured by the [[Opal Necklace]], Hermione helped save her, showing that she cared about Katie. The two girls fought together during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].\n\nOne of Katie's closest friends was [[Leanne]], a Hufflepuff girl in the year below her. Following Alicia and Angelina's graduation, Katie spent a lot of time with Leanne. After Katie was cursed by the opal necklace, Leanne was devastated and cried when Katie was hospitalised.\n\nKatie seemed to get on well with [[Padma Patil]] and [[Cho Chang]] as they were seen together on the Hogwarts Express in [[1997]] and again after the final battle in the following year. Additionally, Cho and Katie were in the same year and played on their respective House Quidditch teams.\n\nKatie may have been friendly with fellow Gryffindors: [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Seamus Finnigan]], [[Dean Thomas]], [[Lavender Brown]], [[Parvati Patil]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], [[Colin and Dennis Creevey]]. Other members of the army were [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], [[Susan Bones]], [[Terry Boot]], [[Anthony Goldstein]], [[Michael Corner]], [[Zacharias Smith]], [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], [[Hannah Abbott]], [[Marietta Edgecombe]], and [[Luna Lovegood]]. Katie possibly disliked Marietta Edgecombe, who betrayed the army to Umbridge, and [[Zacharias Smith]], who abandoned the army during the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\n==Etymology==\n*Katie is derived from ''Katherine'', which itself is derived from the Greek name \u0391\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b7, from the name of the goddess Hecate (who is, perhaps coincidentally, the goddess of magic). It could be related to Greek \u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03af\u03b1 (aikia), meaning \"torture\", which is relative as Katie was tortured during her seventh year.\n*Bell is an English name with various meanings: (1) a person who lived by a town or church bell; (2) a bell-ringer, as in a church; (3) beautiful or handsome (alluding to her attractiveness).\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Katie pm.jpg|200x200px|thumb|Katie Bell as depicted on {{PM}}]]\n[[File:LEGO Katie Bell Y1.png|thumb|Katie Bell in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]\n*Katie Bell was portrayed by [[Emily Dale]] for both {{PS}} and {{COS}} films. An uncredited actress portrayed her in the third film. For {{HBP}}, Dale was replaced by new actress [[Georgina Leonidas]], who retained the role in [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' Parts 1]] and [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|2]].\n*Katie can be seen briefly in the {{POA|FA}}. Her broom is struck by lightning and set on fire during a Quidditch match, and she is lying on a bed in the Hospital wing afterwards.<ref name=\"GQT_refPoA\">[[:File:GQT refPoA.PNG]]</ref> However, her face cannot be seen and the role is uncredited.\n*In the sixth film, Katie and her sixth year friend Leanne are seen in a Potions class with Harry, but in the books, she's one year above him. However, this could be due to [[Horace Slughorn]] becoming the [[Potions Master]] and requiring a lower grade than [[Severus Snape]] to take the [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] Potions class. This would have allowed Katie to take it in her seventh year, when she might not have had the required \"[[Outstanding]]\" [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] to take Snape's classes in their sixth year. However, it is not canon that Katie shared a class with the sixth years, as Harry, Ron and Hermione were mentioned to be the only Gryffindors in their NEWT level class.\n*Katie Bell can be seen sitting with [[Cho Chang]] and [[Padma Patil]] on the [[Hogwarts Express]] in {{DH|F1}} despite both Katie and Cho having been [[seventh year]]s in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]]''. This error is repeated the second part of Deathly Hallows where Katie is seen as a student. However, due to the fact that she spent six months in hospital recovering from her curse, it is possible that Katie returned to Hogwarts in [[1997\u20131998 school year|1997-1998 school year]] to repeat her seventh year. As a result, she would have been in the same year as Harry if this was the case.\n*In {{LEGO|Y2}}, Katie's cursing is omitted despite her being a playable character. This is probably due to the scene being considered too morbid and disturbing for a children's game.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Katie Bell}}\n[[File:KatieBellLEGOY2.png|thumb|Katie Bell in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]\n*{{PS}} {{1st}}\n*{{PS|F}}\n*{{COS}}\n*{{COS|F}}\n*{{COS|G}}\n*{{POA}}\n*{{POA|F}} {{Possible}}<ref name=\"GQT_refPoA\" />\n*{{GOF}}\n*{{OOTP}}\n*{{OOTP|F}} {{C|Appears on Parchment}}\n*{{OOTP|G}} {{C|GBA version only}} {{C|Mentioned only in all other versions}}\n*{{HBP}}\n*{{HBP|F}}\n*{{HBP|G}}\n*{{DH}}\n*{{DH|F1}}\n*{{DH|F2}}\n*{{QWC}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}}\n*{{TCG}}\n*{{PM}}\n*{{WW}}\n*{{HPV|CH}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Start box}} \n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=Unknown, eventually [[James Potter I|James Potter]]\n|position=[[Chaser]] of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]\n|years=?-[[1997]]\n|successor=[[Dean Thomas]]\n}} \n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=[[Dean Thomas]]\n|position=[[Chaser]] of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]\n|years=[[1997]]\n|successor=Unknown\n}} \n{{End box}} \n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}} \n{{Dumbledore's Army}} \n{{St Mungo's}} \n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bell, Katie}}\n\n[[de:Katie Bell]] \n[[es:Katie Bell]] \n[[fr:Katie Bell]]\n[[it:Katie Bell]] \n[[ru:\u041a\u044d\u0442\u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043b]] \n[[fi:Katie Bell]] \n[[nl:Katja Bell]]\n[[pl:Katie Bell]]\n[[pt-br:C\u00e1tia Bell]]\n[[ja:\u30b1\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb]]\n[[Category:1970s births]]\n[[Category:Battle of Hogwarts participants]]\n[[Category:Bell family|Katie]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Chasers]]\n[[Category:Dumbledore's Army]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Imperius Curse victims]]\n[[Category:Plot to assassinate Albus Dumbledore participants]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1990]]\n[[Category:St Mungo's patients]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
