The Gwenog Jones? Captain of the Holyhead Harpies?|Hermione Granger|That's right. Personally, I thought she was a bit full of herself....|[[Hermione Granger]] regarding Gwenog's high opinion of herself|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\n'''Gwenog Jones''' (b. [[1968]]<ref name=\"DOB\" />) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. When Gwenog graduated from Hogwarts, she became a professional [[Quidditch]] player and later achieved fame as the captain and [[Beater]] of the [[Wales|Welsh]] all-female [[Quidditch team]], the [[Holyhead Harpies]].\n\n==Biography==\nGwenog Jones was born into the presumably wizarding [[Jones family]] in 1968. Her family possibly came from [[Wales]] as Jones is a Welsh surname and she later become the manager of the [[Welsh National Quidditch team]].\n\nShe began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1979]].<ref name=\"Age\"/> It's unknown what house she was sorted into. During her time at the school she was became a favourite student of [[Horace Slughorn]], and was consequently inducted into his [[Slug Club]] throughout her time at the school, one of the last before his retirement.<ref name=\"HBP4\">{{HBP|B|4}}</ref>\n\nWhile at Hogwarts, Jones was a member of the school's [[Dragon Club]]. At some time during her school years, she attempted to charm one of the school [[Bludger|bludgers]] to only attack the other teams and accidentally cursed it. Being weak in [[Charms (class)|charms]], she was unable to uncurse it and, ashamed of her poor sportsmanship, she hid it in [[Gwenog Jones's gift statue|a statue]] that she subsequently donated to the Dragon Club.<ref name=\"ADQ\"/>\n\n[[File:Halfblood-00282.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Horace Slughorn]]'s picture of Gwenog on his shelf of favourites]] \n\nSometime after graduating in [[1986]],<ref name=\"Age\"/> Jones became a [[Beater]] for the all-female [[Holyhead Harpies]] [[Quidditch team]], and eventually became the Captain of said team. Remembering her former [[Potions (class)|Potions]] teacher, she gave Slughorn free tickets to her Quidditch matches whenever he so desired.<ref name=\"HBP4\" /> Amongst Jones's biggest fans was [[Ginevra Weasley]], who had a poster of the prestigious Quidditch player on the wall of her small [[Ginevra Weasley's bedroom|bedroom]] at [[the Burrow]].<ref name=\"DH7\">{{DH|B|7}}</ref> In later years Ginny would go on to play for the Harpies, though it is unknown whether Jones was still on the team at that point.\n\nShe paid for the statue hiding [[Gwenog Jones's cursed Bludger|her bludger]] to be bewitched with various protective [[Protective enchantment|enchantments]] in hopes that the bludger would never be seen again. However, it was subsequently released during the [[1986\u20131987 school year]] when [[Diego Caplan]] accidentally destroyed the statue during a friendly [[Duelling|duel]] with [[Jacob's sibling]]. It wreaked havoc on the [[Dragon Clubhouse|clubhouse]], destroying it before being caught and secured.\n\nThis enraged [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] who threatened to revoke everyone\u2019s club privileges. Trying to defuse the situation, Diego and Jacob's sibling cleaned and repaired the mess but were unable to fix the statue due to its enchantments making it resistant to being repaired by [[Repairing charms|normal means]].\n\nWhile seeking a replacement, Jacob's sibling discovered Jones' connection and managed to contact her through their mutual acquaintance, [[Erika Rath]]. Jones returned to the school and she and Jacob's sibling brought the bludger to [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]]. With Flitwick's guidance, Jacob's sibling uncursed the bludger, after which Jones privately confessed the truth of its creation to the student.\n\nLater she gave an inspiring speech to encourage the club members who were despondent after learning that a replacement state would cost 300 [[Galleon|galleons]]. In a brainstorming session with Diego and Jacob\u2019s sibling, they decided to raise the money with a [[Dragon Relay|fundraiser event]] with activities showcasing the classes the Dragon Club focused on. Gwenog herself supervised the event\u2019s broom race.\n\nAs a gift to the club for their hard work in creating the event, she donated a replacement statue to allow the students to put the money towards the club. This gift turned out to be especially important when the fundraiser\u2019s donations came up 48 galleons short. She also donated a [[beater's bat]] signed by the current members of the [[Holyhead Harpies|Holyhead harpies]], herself included <ref name=\"ADQ\"/>\n[[File:It Should Have Been Haiti.png|150px|thumb|right|Gwenog Jones's \"It Should Have Been Haiti\" t-shirt]]\nBy [[2014]], Gwenog Jones had retired from the [[Holyhead Harpies]], and had become the manager of the Welsh National Quidditch Team. Shortly before the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]], Gwenog Jones threatened to \"''[[curse]] the face off''\" rival [[Brazilian National Quidditch team|Brazilian]] manager [[Jos\u00e9 Barboza]], when he called her Chasers \"''talentless [[hag]]s''\" (a comment that he later insisted had been taken out of context). During the [[Brazil]]-[[Wales]] quarter-final match, she showed up to the game in an 'It Should Have Been [[Haiti]]' T-shirt and was prevented from entering the stadium, therefore missing the first ten minutes of the game. She later ended up in custody when, after Brazilian Seeker [[Tony Silva]] caught the [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]] and won the game, she attempted to curse off Barboza's face in the packed stadium and was dragged away by her own Beaters.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n\n==Physical appearance==\n[[File:HM Gwenog Jones.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Gwenog Jones's physical appearance]]\nGwenog was described as being a tall, dark-skinned witch. Due to the fact she was a beater it can be presumed that she was fairly burly or at least had a 'beater's build'. She had dark brown hair and brown eyes.<ref name=\"JKRS\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nJones had said on a number of occasions that [[Wizardkind|witches]] made better [[Quidditch]] players than [[Wizardkind|wizards]], and no one was likely to disagree with her. This was because \"''people who disagreed with [Jones] had a nasty habit of turning into woodlice.''\" After a game she enjoyed relaxing with friends, drinking [[butterbeer]], and listening to the [[Weird Sisters]]. [[Hermione Granger]] considered Gwenog to be \"a bit full of herself\" after meeting her at one of Slughorn's [[Slug Club]] meetings in 1996.<ref name=\"HBP14\">{{HBP|B|14}}</ref> It is thought that the [[International Confederation of Wizards Quidditch Committee|ICWQC]]'s ban on 'managerial trash talk' was made with her in mind.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Jones was evidently a highly accomplished and talented [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player, given how she became both the [[Captain]] and [[Beater]] for the [[Holyhead Harpies]] Quidditch team, a very impressive achievement in the [[magic]]al sport which gained much fame and recognition in the world of Quidditch. She was so experienced in playing the sport that she eventually became the Manager of the [[Welsh National Quidditch team]]. \n*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': It was said that \"''people who disagreed with [Jones] had a nasty habit of turning into [[Wood louse|woodlice]]''\", this meant that Jones was capable of casting a transfiguration [[spell]] which turned [[human]]s into [[Wood louse|woodlice]]. \n*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Jones appeared to a level of skill with the casting of [[dark charm]]s, given how she threatened to [[curse]] [[Jos\u00e9 Barboza]] during a Quidditch match and had to be pulled away by her own players to prevent her from cursing him.<ref name=\"PM\" /> Jones also accidentally [[curse]]d a [[Gwenog Jones's cursed Bludger|Bludger]] in her youth, which she also found herself unable to [[Counter-curse|reverse]].<ref name=\"ADQ\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Gwenog ''is the name of an obscure Welsh saint, most notable for her [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Gwenog%27s_Church,_Llanwenog namesake church] in Llanwenog. The name is presumably derived from the Welsh ''Gwen'', which means \"fair, blessed.\"\n\n''Jones ''is a very common Welsh surname derived from the name ''John'', which means \"God is gracious.\"\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Gwenog may be related to [[Hestia Jones]], a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], [[Peter Jones]], a [[Gryffindor]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], and/or [[Megan Jones]], a [[Hufflepuff]] student at Hogwarts in [[Harry Potter]]'s year.\n*The illustration on Gwenog's [[Wizard of the Month]] profile shows her to have dark skin and purple Quidditch robes. However, in the signed photo of Gwenog owned by [[Horace Slughorn]] in {{HBP|FA}}, she has light skin and is wearing yellow Quidditch robes.\n*Although she definitely attended a party earlier in the year, it is unknown, being a former member of the Slug Club, whether or not she attended the [[Slug Club Christmas party]] in [[1996]].\n*In {{HM}} Quidditch Season 2 (set in the [[1986\u20131987 school year]]), the [[unidentified Beater]] mentions Gwenog Jones being her hero. As this mention happens when [[Ethan Parkin]] is talking about a match against the Holyhead Harpies, this likely indicates Gwenog Jones had already graduated in [[1986]] and joined the Holyhead Harpies immediately after graduation.<ref>{{HM|3|Q2|12}}</ref> This is confirmed in the [[A Dragon's Quest]] adventure, which is set in the same school year and sees Gwenog having graduated.<ref name=\"Age\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Gwenog Jones}}\n*{{PS|G}} {{FWC}}\n*{{COS|G}} {{1st}} {{FWC}}\n*{{POA|G}} {{FWC}}\n*{{HBP}} {{Mention}}\n*{{HBP|F}} {{Photograph}}\n*{{DH}} {{Mention}}\n*{{PM}} {{Mention}}\n*{{WW}} {{Mention}}\n*{{JKRS}}\n*{{HM}}\n*{{WU}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=[[Felix Summerbee]]\n|position=[[Wizard of the Month]]\n|years=[[June]] [[2004]]\n|successor=[[Donaghan Tremlett]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n{{Quidditch positions}}\n{{Chocolate Frog Cards}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jones, Gwenog}}\n[[de2:Gwenog Jones]]\n[[de:Gwenog Jones]]\n[[es:Gwenog Jones]]\n[[fr:Gwenog Jones]]\n[[fi:Gwenog Jones]]\n[[it:Gwenog Jones]]\n[[nl:Griet Jansen]]\n[[no:Gwenog Hansen]]\n[[pl:Gwenog Jones]]\n[[ru:\u0413\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0433 \u0414\u0436\u043e\u043d\u0441]]\n[[sv:Gwenog Jones]]\n[[zh:\u683c\u97e6\u8bfa\u683c\u00b7\u743c\u65af]]\n[[Category:1968 births]]\n[[Category:Beaters]]\n[[Category:Brown-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Dragon Club]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Jones family]]\n[[Category:Quidditch Captains]]\n[[Category:Quidditch managers]]\n[[Category:Silver Chocolate Frog Cards]]\n[[Category:Slug Club]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1979]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Welsh individuals]]\n[[Category:Wizard of the Month]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
