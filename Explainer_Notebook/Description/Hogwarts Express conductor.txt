The conductor of the Hogwarts Express knows anything and everything about the village of Hogsmeade. He maintains a keen knowledge of what can be purchased where throughout the area, as well as knowing the history of the village and all the locations within. Visitors to the town may stop by the station to ask him any number of questions, as he enjoys answering any query delivered his way. The conductor carries with him at all times a [[Hogwarts Express conductor's pocket watch|gold enchanted pocket watch]] that he uses to be sure everything in his charge is always on time. The Hogwarts Express engine head plaque is engraved on the top of the watch cover along with the engine number of the Hogwarts Express, 5972. On the reverse side is the Hogwarts school crest and motto. The face of the watch is enchanted but may appear to show the words \"Hogsmeade Station\" on the top of the face, \"King's Cross\" on the bottom, with the left hand side reading: \"Late\" and the right hand side reading: \"On time\".\n*Through the film series a lot of people can be seen with clothes identical to his own, so it is possible that he appears in the films too, despite never identified.\n\n==Appearances==\n[[File:Hogwarts_Express_conductor_WU.png|thumb|200px|The Hogwarts Express conductor as seen in {{WU}}\n]]\n*{{PS}} {{1st mention}}\n*{{PS|F}} {{Possible}}\n*{{PS|G}} {{1st}} {{C|GBC version only}}\n*{{POA|F}} {{Mention}} {{Possible}}\n*{{POA|G}} {{C|GBA version only}}\n*{{DH|F2}} {{Possible}}\n*{{WWHP}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}}\n*{{WU}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[es:Conductor del Expreso de Hogwarts]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Foundables]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts Express crew|Conductor]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Unidentified Hogwarts Students]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
