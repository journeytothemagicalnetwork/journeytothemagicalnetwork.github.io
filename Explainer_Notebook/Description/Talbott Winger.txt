He was also an [[Animagus]] and took the form of an [[Eagle]]. At some point in the [[1970s]] or early [[1980s]], his parents were murdered by [[Death Eaters]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life {{C|1970s\u20131983}}===\nTalbott was born at some point in [[1972]] or [[1973]].<ref name=\"age\"/> He did not have any siblings.<ref name=\"HM5PP\">{{HM|5|PORTRAIT PANIC}}</ref> His mother taught him how to become an [[Animagus]], taking the form of an [[eagle]]. During the [[First Wizarding War]], his parents helped in the war efforts against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]].<ref name=\"backstory\">{{HM|3|Become an Animagus|3}}</ref>\n\nIn response, the Dark Lord's Death Eaters attacked their home, a conflict during which both of his parents were murdered while Talbott himself successfully escaped with his life thanks to his Animagus ability.<ref name=\"Animagus\"/>\n\n===Hogwarts years {{C|1984\u2013}}===\n====Early years====\nTalbott started attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] on [[1 September]] [[1984]]<ref name=\"age\"/> and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw]] and excelled in [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]]. He also helped [[Care of Magical Creatures]] Professor [[Silvanus Kettleburn]] tame a [[Hippogriff]] once, a feat also achieved by [[Jacob's sibling]] in their [[fourth year]].<ref name=\"Animagus\">{{HM|3|Become an Animagus}}</ref>\n\nIn or prior to the [[1986\u20131987 school year]], he admitted the truth to [[Minerva McGonagall]]. While she understood his initial reasons for keeping it secret perfectly (namely the fear that if he registered, the Death Eaters might learn of it and come after him), she nevertheless sternly instructed him to abide by the law that all Animagi had to register with the [[British Ministry of Magic]], to which he half-heartedly agreed.<ref name=\"backstory\"/>\n\n====Third year====\nDuring his [[third year]], Talbott took [[Divination (class)|Divination]] as an elective.<ref name=\"Y6ch2\">{{HM|6|2}}</ref>\n\nHe helped [[Jacob's sibling]] become an [[Animagus]] at the beginning of this year.<ref name=\"Animagus\"></ref><ref>[https://jamcity.helpshift.com/a/harry-potter-hogwarts-mystery/?l=en&s=events&f=become-an-animagus Become an Animagus! | Jam City Support]</ref> During Jacob's sibling's and Talbott's talk with McGonagall, she proclaimed that if he did not agree, she \"will take it as a personal offence and drag him to the Ministry myself\". He later told Jacob's sibling about his parents' murder after they beat him at Gobstones. After wishing them luck on becoming an Animagus, he changed into his Animagus form and flew away.\n\nAround the anniversary of his parents' murder, he lost [[Talbott Winger's swan necklace|his necklace]], whose feather had been extracted from [[Talbott Winger's mother|his mother]]'s Animagus form, a [[White Swan]]. This made him extremely upset and he became more isolated than ever. Upon learning about this from [[Penny Haywood]], Jacob's sibling helped him find the necklace. They made use of their advantage of transforming into animals and eventually decided it was in [[Argus Filch|Filch]]'s office or being played with by [[Mrs Norris]]. They saw Mrs Norris with the necklace, and Jacob's sibling transformed into their Animagus form to distract her while Talbott retrieved the necklace. Talbott befriended Jacob's sibling after this experience.<ref>{{HM|3|Birds Of A Feather}}</ref><ref>[https://jamcity.helpshift.com/a/harry-potter-hogwarts-mystery/?l=en&s=adventures&f=talbott-friendship-adventure Talbott Friendship Adventure | Jam City Support]</ref>\n\n====Fourth year====\nAt some point, someone told him [[Garrick Ollivander]] owned a [[Garrick Ollivander's peacock|peacock]]. He later told [[Jacob's sibling]] about this in the [[Hogwarts Library]].<ref>{{HM|4|Become a Prefect|1}}</ref>\n\nAround [[Valentine's Day]], Talbott was one of the six students chosen by [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] as a part of the ''[[Voyages, Vampires, and Valentines!]]'' event, seemingly at random. Talbott was given the task to find doves. As he was searching for them in the [[Clock Tower Courtyard]], Jacob's sibling came to see how he was doing. The two searched for doves together but were unable to find any. After giving up on the search, Talbott told them that he was suspicious of Lockhart's true intentions, and that he suspected Lockhart knew he was an Animagus. Talbott also confessed to Jacob's sibling that he wanted them to be his Valentine. He later attended the event with the other students, wearing a pink outfit with a tie, designed by [[Andre Egwu]]. During the event, Lockhart cast a [[Memory Charm]] in hesitation, causing him and the other students to lose some of their recent memories.<ref>{{HM|4|Valentine's Day}}</ref> \n\nLater during the same school year, when Jacob's sibling went into the [[Great Hall]] to discuss [[Potions (class)|Potions]] with their friend [[Penny Haywood]], the best in their year at that subject, he was seated at his house table, where he cryptically warned them that he thought \"''there'' [was] ''a storm coming''...\", suggesting he might have known something more about the events going on at the school than the average student.<ref>{{HM|4|Become a Prefect|3}}</ref>\n\n====Fifth year====\nIn his [[fifth year]], Talbott came to talk to the [[Helena Ravenclaw|Grey Lady]] alongside Jacob's sibling and their other Ravenclaw friends [[Tulip Karasu]] and [[Andre Egwu]].<ref>{{HM|5|6}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Equinox Enchanted school play, he was sad as he didn't get to perform the scene of love with Jacob's sibling. However, he sat in the front row during Jacob's sibling's performance and cheered them on. \n\nNear the end of the school year, Talbott was in the [[Great Hall]] when it was almost time for him and the other fifth years to take their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]], at which time he admitted to being anxious about getting a good score on his exams, as he harboured aspirations of becoming an [[Auror]].<ref>\"Taking the O.W.L.s\" side quest. Seen [https://youtu.be/kpVV_S84s6U?t=340 here].</ref>\n\n====Sixth year====\nTalbott Winger continued taking Divination classes in his sixth year.<ref name=\"Y6ch2\"/>\n\nFollowing the murder of [[Rowan Khanna]] at the hands of [[Patricia Rakepick]] in the [[Forbidden Forest]], Talbott became a member of the student organisation the [[Circle of Khanna]], in memory of the deceased student.<ref name=\"HM620\"/> He also helped Jacob's sibling various times (which, granted, still took some convincing) in his [[Animagus]] form.\n\n==Physical appearance==\n[[File:Talbott_Winger_-_HM.png|thumb|Talbott's appearance]]\nIn his [[human]] form, Talbott had dark brown and blond straight hair, dark skin and striking hazel eyes, with pouty lips, thick eyebrows and an angular face. <ref name=\"appearance\"/> In his [[Animagus]] form, he took the form of a brown [[Eagle]], sometimes with a cream chest.<ref name=\"Animagus\"/>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nTalbott was a remarkably skilled and intelligent young wizard, who possessed many traits of [[Ravenclaw]]s, in particular intelligence and individuality. He was known to be an extreme introvert and a loner, and before befriending [[Jacob's sibling]], his only friends were [[Penny Haywood|Penny]], [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], and despite being the Head of [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]: [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], due to her being a fellow [[Animagus]] ([[cat]]) and her previous work in the [[Ministry of Magic]]. Talbott Winger was academically minded, and was very passionate about his schoolwork, as he wished to become an [[Auror]], showing him to have been very ambitious in his life goals. He was also rather perceptive and intuitive, as shown when he warned Jacob's sibling about bad things that were going on, implying he knew much more about the dark happenings that were going on during his school time than the average student did. Due to his reserved personality, Talbott often talked to himself, and also possessed a rather unique gift for forging handwriting. He was also shown to be sarcastic and witty, as seen in his interactions with Jacob's sibling.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n[[File:Talbott Winger Animagus.jpg|thumb|Talbott Winger in his [[Animagus]] form]]\n*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Talbott was remarkably skilful in [[Human Transfiguration]] that he was able to become an Animagus. He was also a high academic achiever in [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration class]], showing his proficiency in this highly complex, [[Science|scientific]] and even dangerous branch of [[magic]].<ref name=\"Animagus\"/>\n*'''[[Herbology]]''': He was also known to be talented in this subject at school, given he worked in the family garden helping his mother, handling both magical and mundane plants, who was a [[Healer]].\n*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': Talbott was shown to be interested and skilled in [[Magizoology]], as he, like [[Jacob's sibling]], had both successfully tamed a [[Hippogriff]], which Hagrid told Jacob's sibling about during their process in becoming an [[Animagus]]. This was an impressive feat indeed, given how Hippogriffs are rather difficult [[beast]]s to handle and tame.\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Talbott appeared to be gifted with charm-work, as he was capable of casting the rather advanced [[Human-presence-revealing Spell]].\n*'''[[Divination]]''': Talbott was skilled in the field of divination, having earned an [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] in the [[Divination (class)|subject]] at Hogwarts, and also studied it [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] level.\n*'''Poetry''': Talbott was known to very much enjoy writing and reading poetry in his spare time, often due to his very solemn, mournful and solitary personality. He was evidently a talented poet, as he commented that several of his poems were published in the [[Daily Prophet]], a newspaper which his [[Talbott Winger's father|father]] was once a writer for. However, he did remark that his poems were not so good at the age of six.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Talbott Winger is an aloof Ravenclaw who prefers to fly solo rather than stick with the flock. Though slow to trust and sarcastic, Talbott knows how to keep a secret and can help you out of tricky situations.|Talbott's character description|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n*If Talbott succeeded in obtaining the results necessary to qualify for the [[Auror training]] programme and subsequently passed it, he, alongside [[Nymphadora Tonks]], would have become two of the last Aurors taken on in two years by the time of the [[1995\u20131996 school year]].\n*As of Year 3 Chapter 9, Talbott and Jacob's sibling are both unregistered Animagi when they finally became friends (if Jacob's sibling decides not to register, even when they could decide to do so). \n*He often makes [[bird]] puns in reference to his Animagus form and solitary personality.\n*He is also not very adept at Duelling or Flying, seeing as he wasn't chosen for the Dragon Club.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Talbott Winger}}\n*{{HM}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Animagi}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Winger, Talbott}}\n\n[[fr:Talbott Winger]]\n[[ru:\u0422\u0430\u043b\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0442 \u0423\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0435\u0440]]\n[[Category:1970s births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Brown-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Circle of Khanna]]\n[[Category:Hippogriff Club]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Only children]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Poets]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws Sorted in 1984]]\n[[Category:Sphinx Club]]\n[[Category:Unregistered Animagi]]\n[[Category:Winger family]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
