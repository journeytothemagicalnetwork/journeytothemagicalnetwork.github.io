An irrelevance.

He really isn\u2019t like his father at all, is he?|Polly mocking Albus Potter's poor flying ability|Harry Potter and the Cursed Child}}\nPolly began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] on 1 September [[2017]] and was sorted into [[Gryffindor]].<ref name=\"act1scene4\" /><ref name=\"act2scene11\">{{CC|B|2|11}}</ref> During the [[sorting ceremony]], she remarked that it was not surprising that [[Scorpius Malfoy]] was sorted into [[Slytherin]], but expressed shock when [[Albus Potter]] was placed in the same house.<ref name=\"act1scene4\" />\n\nWhen Albus Potter proved unable to get his [[broomstick]] to rise off the ground during their first [[flying (class)|flying]] lesson with [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]], Polly disparaged him, stating that he wasn't \"like his father at all.\"<ref name=\"act1scene4\" />\n\n===Second year===\nDuring a [[Potions (class)|Potions]] lesson in their second year, Polly once again teased Albus, calling him an \"irrelevance\" and suggesting that even the school's [[portrait]]s tried to avoid him when he walked past.<ref name=\"act1scene4\" />\n\n===Fourth year===\nPolly's life was briefly changed in [[2020]] when Albus and Scorpius [[Time-Turner|altered the past.]] In an alternate reality, Albus was in Gryffindor as well. However, in their [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] lesson taught by [[Hermione Granger]], Albus questioned Hermione about the changed circumstances which prompted her to deduct points from Gryffindor.<ref name=\"act2scene11\" /> Polly angrily accused Albus of losing points on purpose because he \"hate[d] Gryffindor and everyone [knew] it.\"<ref name=\"act2scene11\" /> Professor Granger told Polly to sit down before she was forced to dock even more points.<ref name=\"act2scene11\" /> Later, when Albus and Scorpius were discussing how their actions had changed history in the [[Hogwarts Library]], Polly shushed them.<ref name=\"act2scene16\">{{CC|B|2|16}}</ref>\n\nHer life was changed again when Albus and Scorpius meddled with the past a second time. Polly still attended Hogwarts in a world where Voldemort won and Albus was never born. Polly asked Scorpius whether he intended to invite her to the [[Blood Ball]].<ref name=\"act3scene2\">{{CC|B|3|2}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nPolly Chapman was a very confident and opinionated young witch. She tended to speak her mind and was unafraid of asking for something she wanted - such as asking Scorpius to the [[Blood Ball]] in an alternate universe. Her wit was as sharp as her tongue, but could sometimes be harsh and cruel, particularly towards the shy and unsure Albus Potter, whom she often spitefully disparaged and mocked due to his perceived lack of abilities.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*In {{CC|P1}}, Polly is played by [[Claudia Grant]].\n*In an alternative universe, Polly used Harry Potter's name as a form of insult or slang similar to \"Oh Merlin\". It is possible that it was considered normal to insult Potter from the grave.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{CC}} {{1st}}\n*{{CC|P}}\n*{{WW}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chapman, Polly}}\n[[de:Polly Chapman]]\n[[es:Polly Chapman]]\n[[pl:Polly Chapman]]\n[[fr:Polly Chapman]]\n[[Category:2000s births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 2017]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
