Nott did not search for Voldemort after his downfall, but this was forgiven after Voldemort's [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return]] in [[1995]]. Nott fought at several battles of the [[Second Wizarding War]], including the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], in which he was injured. After the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] and Voldemort's final defeat, he was presumably killed or imprisoned in [[Azkaban]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nNott was born into the [[pure-blood]] [[Nott family]], which placed much interest in purity of blood, and was listed as one of the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]].<ref name=\"PM\">{{WW|pure-blood}}</ref> He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and may have been a classmate of [[Tom Riddle]], as well as a member of his [[Tom Riddle's gang|gang]]. While part of the student body, he seems to have become a friend of [[Horace Slughorn]], and as such was likely part of the [[Slug Club]], although the [[professor]] denied this connection in later years, after Nott was revealed to have become one of the first [[Death Eaters]].<ref name=\"HBP7\">{{HBP|B|7}}</ref>\n\n===First Wizarding War===\n{{Quote|...-Nott, [[Rosier]], [[Mulciber (Riddle-era)|Mulciber]], [[Antonin Dolohov|Dolohov]]- waiting for [[Tom Riddle|your]] return...

An elderly widower, Nott raised his son, [[Theodore Nott|Theodore]], after the death of [[Theodore Nott's mother|his wife]] sometime before [[1991]].<ref name=\"rowling\" /> Nott was also one of the [[Death Eaters]] who did not search for Voldemort after his downfall.<ref name=\"GOF33\">{{GOF|B|33}}</ref>\n\n===Second Wizarding War===\nWhen Voldemort [[Return of Lord Voldemort|returned]]  to power in [[1995]], Nott [[Apparition|Apparated]] to his side in the [[Little Hangleton graveyard]] when summoned and professed to be Voldemort's most faithful servant.<ref name=\"GOF33\">{{GOF|B|33}}</ref>\n\n====Battle of the Department of Mysteries====\nThe [[1996|following year]], Nott participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]. He grabbed hold of [[Harry Potter]] as he and his friends fled the [[Hall of Prophecy]], but was [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] by [[Hermione Granger]], leaving him incapacitated as shelves filled with [[prophecy|prophecies]] collapsed around him. The group leader, [[Lucius Malfoy]], ordered the other Death Eaters to leave Nott behind, stating that his injuries would be considered nothing by Voldemort compared to the loss of the particular prophecy which Voldemort sought.<ref name=\"OOTP35\">{{OOTP|B|35}}</ref> It's possible (though unlikely) that Nott recovered to fight against the [[Order of the Phoenix]] later on in the battle, though it's more likely that he was one of the two who were too incapacitated to take part. After the battle, Nott was exposed as a Death Eater and imprisoned in [[Azkaban]].\n\nNott's exposure lead to a loss of status. This prevented his son Theodore from being invited by Horace Slughorn into the Slug Club, even though Nott himself was an old friend and favourite of his. He most likely [[Azkaban escapes#1997|escaped from Azkaban]] along with many other Death Eaters in the summer of [[1997]] and served Voldemort during the height of the [[Second Wizarding War]]. He possibly fought in several battles, including the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].\n\n===Post-war===\nIf Nott survived the [[Second Wizarding War]], it is likely he was re-imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for his crimes. \n\n==Physical appearance==\nHe was described as a stooped man, although it is unknown if his stooped appearance was due to old age, injury, or because he often bowed down to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. He was said to be a relatively small [[Wizardkind|wizard]], especially compared to the likes of [[Crabbe]] and [[Goyle]].<ref name=\"GOF33\">{{GOF|B|33}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nNott was shown to be incredibly sycophantic towards Voldemort, as he desperately and disingenuously claimed that he was his most faithful servant, before being silenced by his master for his dishonesty.<ref name=\"GOF33\">{{GOF|B|33}}</ref> Despite this he is not known to have searched for his master, suggesting that he was not as faithful as he claimed to be though it was equally likely that he merely believed his master was [[Death|dead]] and gone forever. As a longtime and devoted Death Eater it can be assumed that he held [[Non-magic people|Muggles]], [[blood traitor]]s and anyone not considered a [[pure-blood]] in hatred and that he was a [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood supremacist]]. It is likely that he was a skilled, important, or otherwise influential [[Wizardkind|wizard]] as he was deemed a valuable connection by [[Horace Slughorn]]. \n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Being a longtime [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], Nott would have been highly accomplished with dark magic and with the casting of [[Dark charm]]s, most likely including the [[Unforgivable Curses]].\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': Being a Death Eater, Nott would have been competent with [[Martial magic]] and a fairly talented duellist, given how he participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]<ref name=\"OOTP35\">{{OOTP|B|35}}</ref> though he was injured early on. He likely participated in many other battles with his fellow Death Eaters in both the [[First Wizarding War|First]] and the [[Second Wizarding War]]s.\n*'''[[Apparition]]''': Nott was capable of Apparition, as he was able to apparate successfully to his master's side in the [[Little Hangleton graveyard]].<ref name=\"GOF33\">{{GOF|B|33}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Rowling originally created a subplot that was to be featured in either [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|the second]] or [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|fourth book]] in which he and his [[Theodore Nott|son]] visited the [[Malfoy Manor]]. He and [[Lucius Malfoy]] were to discuss their shady business in private while their sons conversed in the gardens. Rowling also claimed that the [[Nott family|Notts]] were just as pure-blooded as the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]].\n*While [[Paschal Friel]] is credited as playing Knott [sic], he may also have been played by [[Philip Rham]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''<ref name=\"role\">Although an [http://web.archive.org/web/20070805075108/http://uk.castingcallpro.com/view.php?uid=78550 old CV at CastingCall Pro] lists his role as Knott [sic] he is the only of the six actors credited as Death Eaters that resembles [[Crabbe]] when he is unmasked (see [[:File:Crabbe unmasked-GOF.jpg| this image]])</ref>.\n*In the film he is shown carrying a walking stick not unlike the [[Lucius Malfoy's walking stick|one]] owned by [[Lucius Malfoy]]. It is possible that it possesses [[magic]]al properties like Malfoy's.\n*It is possible that he is a descendant of [[Cantankerus Nott]].\n*It's possible that he was one of the boys with Tom Riddle seen in [[Horace Slughorn]]'s memory. Given that we know that Nott was an old favourite of Slughorn's adds to this possibility.\n*In the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], one of the ten Death Eaters who corner Harry in the Death Room is described as \"bleeding badly\". It's possible that this was either him, as he had been injured by the collapsing shelves earlier, or the Death Eater who had been hit in the face when [[Luna Lovegood]] used the [[Reductor Curse]] on the replica of [[Pluto]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{GOF}} {{1st}}\n*{{GOF|F}}\n*{{GOF|G}}\n*{{OOTP}}\n*{{HBP}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Death Eaters}}\n\n[[es:Nott]]\n[[de:Nott sr.]]\n[[fr:Nott]]\n[[ru:\u041d\u043e\u0442\u0442-\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0438\u0439]]\n[[pl:Nott Sr]]\n[[pt-br:Nott]]\n[[Category:Azkaban escapees]]\n[[Category:Battle of the Department of Mysteries participants]]\n[[Category:British individuals]]\n[[Category:Death Eaters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nott family]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Tom Riddle's gang]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Widowed individuals]]"
