[[1576]] \u2013 [[1634]]) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[pure-blood]] [[Dark Wizard|Dark witch]]. She was the aunt of [[Isolt Sayre]], the founder of [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Gormlaith had attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where she was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]].\n\nGormlaith believed strongly in [[pure-blood supremacy]] and had an intense hatred for anyone that went against these extreme views. Her hatred went so deep that she murdered her own [[Rionach Sayre|sister]] and [[William Sayre|brother-in-law]] for showing sympathy towards her [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] neighbours. Gormlaith died in 1634, while trying to enact revenge against [[Isolt Sayre|Isolt]] and her family.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Family lineage===\nGormlaith was a descendant of [[Salazar Slytherin]], one of the founders of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. She was born into the [[Ireland|Irish]] branch of the family. She believed in the same [[pure-blood]] supremacy Slytherin did and owned his [[Salazar Slytherin's wand|wand]].<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\n===Early life===\nGormlaith was born in [[Ireland]]. She had one sister named [[Rionach Sayre|Rionach]]. At some point, Gormlaith attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where she was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin]] house.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\n===Raising Isolt Sayre===\n[[File:Gormlaith Gaunt burns down Ilvermorny Cottage.png|200px|thumb|left|Gormlaith sets the Sayre cottage on fire]]\nGormlaith became estranged from Rionach by the time her niece [[Isolt Sayre]] was born around 1603; this was most likely due to their differing beliefs. [[Rionach Sayre|Rionach]] was helpful to her [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] neighbours by producing cures for them and their livestock and did not seem to share her family's beliefs in their pure blood superiority. One day, Gormlaith started a fire at Rionach's house of [[Ilvermorny Cottage]] which killed her and her husband [[William Sayre]]. Gormlaith \"saved\" Isolt because she hoped to put her on the \"right path\". She believed Rionach's idea of helping Muggles would lead Isolt to marry one, of which the very idea was something Gormlaith found completely unacceptable. She then moved her niece to the neighbouring valley of [[Coomcallee]].\n[[File:Gormlaith Gaunt takes in Isolt Sayre.png|200px|thumb|Gormlaith \"saving\" her young niece [[Isolt Sayre]]]]\nGormlaith kept [[Isolt Sayre|Isolt]] in isolation for twelve years and was very wicked to her niece by making her watch when she [[jinx]]ed or [[curse]]d any [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] or animal which strayed too close to their cottage. She would not let Isolt attend [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] because she said it was an establishment which taught [[Mudblood]]s. She would say it was a shame [[Slytherin]] had been unable to stop them attending and wouldn't even let [[Isolt Sayre|Isolt]] have her own [[wand]]. Gormlaith left Isolt feeling very alone while also thinking her aunt was insane. At some point, Gormlaith began teaching Isolt the [[Dark Arts]], until Isolt had learned enough to be able to escape along with Gormlaith's wand. However, Gormlaith was very good at hunting people down, and so she eventually found Isolt living in [[England]]. But when Isolt escaped a second time and took the [[Mayflower]] to the [[United States of America|New World]], Gormlaith would not find Isolt again for some time.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\n===Travelling to Ilvermony School===\n\n====Seeking her \"daughter\"====\nSome time later, around 1634, Gormlaith found out a headmistress at a new [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|school of magic]] in the New World was nicknamed \"Morrigan\". She remembered her niece was named this by her father because of their lineage to [[Morrigan]] herself. When she also heard the school was named Ilvermorny, she knew it was [[Isolt Sayre|Isolt]] because it was the name of the same cottage Isolt was born in and Gormlaith set fire to. She was also upset to hear Isolt had married a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] and opened the school up to anyone with [[Magic genes|magic]] and not a select few of pure-bloods.\n\nGormlaith went to [[Ollivanders]], a [[wand]] shop she did not want to buy from. She was given a [[Gormlaith Gaunt's second wand|new wand]] with a [[dragon heartstring]] [[Wand core|core]] before she went on the ship [[Bonaventure]] under the guise of a man with the name of William Sayre \u2014 the same name of both Isolt's father and someone she killed. The Bonaventure landed in Virginia before Gormlaith made her way in the winter to [[Mount Greylock]], Massachusetts where [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Ilvermorny School]] was placed. She wanted to kill Isolt and her husband [[James Steward]] and steal their young daughters, [[Martha (disambiguation)|Martha]] and [[Rionach Steward]], in which Gormlaith planned to set them on the same path she had hoped Isolt herself should have done.\n[[File:Gormlaith Gaunt casts a curse.png|241x241px|thumb|left|Gormlaith arrives at Ilvermorny to exact her revenge against Isolt and her family]]\nGormlaith then said a spell with the name of Isolt and James which put them in a deep sleep before she spoke [[Parseltongue]] to make Isolt's wand \u2014 which had originally belonged to Gormlaith \u2014 become inactive. But when Gormlaith went into Ilvermorny, she had not known Isolt had two adopted sons aged sixteen and fourteen who were skilled with a wand made of Horned Serpent horn. When she spoke Parseltongue, she had awoken their wands instead which warned [[Chadwick Boot|Chadwick]] and [[Webster Boot]] of Gormlaith. Chadwick had dreamed of such a Dark witch coming to [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Ilvermorny]] and went out to meet and stop her.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\n====Showdown and death====\nGormlaith underestimated [[Chadwick Boot|Chadwick]] when they began to duel because even though she was more powerful than him, he had been well taught by Isolt. Gormlaith didn't want to kill Chadwick because she thought he was very talented and wanted to know whether he was a pure-blood. She told him she would not want to kill him if he was because he had so much potential. However, Chadwick would not reply and when [[Webster Boot|Webster]] eventually joined them, the [[Horned Serpent]] [[Horned Serpent horn|horn]] core the brothers' wands shared increased their power. The duel woke up young [[Martha Steward|Martha]] and [[Rionach Steward|Rionach]] Steward who were scared and cried for their parents. Gormlaith did not understand love and, as a result, the cries of their children woke [[Isolt Sayre|Isolt]] and [[James Steward|James]] by breaking through the enchantment Gormlaith had placed upon them.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\nGormlaith, Chadwick, and Webster were then joined by Isolt, but the wand she took with her was still inactive and proved to be unhelpful. Gormlaith then drove them back inside the castle and upstairs to the room where she could hear her great-nieces crying. When Gormlaith managed to break down the door to the room, she found James standing in front of his daughters in order to protect them. But when Gormlaith went to kill him, Isolt said the name of her father William which instead called upon the [[William (Pukwudgie)|pukwudgie]] she had befriended several years earlier. The pukwudgie pierced Gormlaith's heart with one of its [[poison]]ous [[Pukwudgie arrow|arrows]] tipped with pukwudgie venom which-due to interaction with Gormlaith's own protective magic-reduced her to nothing except dust and a broken wand of which nothing but some of its core remained.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nGormlaith died unmourned by her immediate family. Her grand-niece [[Rionach Steward]] was the only one of her descendants who inherited the [[House of Gaunt|Gaunt family]]'s ability to speak [[Parseltongue]], but Rionach abhorred her great-aunt's memory. Indeed, it was rumoured (though never confirmed) that Rionach never married because she was afraid of producing offspring with the same ability, and hoped that, if she died childless, then the last of the Gaunt family line would die with her. In this she was mistaken, since the Gaunt family survived in England, eventually ending with [[Marvolo Gaunt]], his children [[Morfin Gaunt|Morfin]] and [[Merope Riddle|Merope]], his grandson, [[Tom Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]], and great-granddaughter, [[Delphini]].<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\n==Physical appearance==\nGormlaith was a pale woman who had dark hair and dark eyes. Like [[Tom Riddle]], her distant relative, her appearance was negatively altered by her immersion in the [[Dark Arts]].<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nGormlaith was a [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood supremacist]] and [[Dark Wizard|dark witch]] with an unstable and violent temper. She was obsessive, controlling, and homicidal, to the point where she was willing to murder her own sister and brother-in-law due to them not sharing traditional [[House of Gaunt|Gaunt family]] beliefs. She was so consumed by her pure-blood fanaticism that she was willing to kill at the slightest provocation and would be willing to spare only pure-bloods but more than willing to murder or torture anyone else. She was also incredibly cruel and sadistic, as she isolated and abused her niece [[Isolt Sayre|Isolt]] whilst she was in her care, refusing her to attend Hogwarts, forbidding her any contact with the outside world and subjecting her to psychological torture, showing her cruelty to be unrelenting and fanatical.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\nShe was the portrait of a psychopath: possessed of delusions of grandeur, believing that pure-bloods were inherently greater and more powerful entities; enjoying the basic nuances of human torture and murder, taking great pleasure in ending human life; having no sense of remorse for her murders, and actually taking pleasure and pride in the ones she committed.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Gormlaith was incredibly talented in the Dark Arts, having immersed herself into magic aimed largely at bringing pain and death to others, to the extent of it altering her physical appearance. She was noted to have forced her niece, Isolt, to watch as she [[curse]]d and [[jinx]]ed any Muggle or animal that strayed too near their cottage, and was even capable of casting a powerful [[Gormlaith Gaunt's curse|sleeping curse]] that placed Isolt and [[James Steward]] in a bewitched slumber, showing her proficiency in the casting of [[dark charm]]s.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" /> It was also possible that she had used [[Fiendfyre]] to burn down her sister's and brother-in-law's cottage.\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': She was a highly gifted duellist, capable of overcoming the combined efforts of both [[Chadwick Boot|Chadwick]] and [[Webster Boot]] during her attack on [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Ilvermorny]] and drove the brothers back inside the castle, despite the [[Twin Wand Cores|twin cores]] of their wands increasing their power tenfold, which spoke for her considerable capability in [[martial magic]].\n*'''[[Parseltongue]]''': Gormlaith was a Parselmouth, a trait she inherited from her ancestor, [[Salazar Slytherin]]. She used Parseltongue to disable [[Salazar Slytherin's wand|Isolt Sayre's wand]].<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n*'''Tracking skills''': Gormlaith was noted for her prodigious talent of tracking people down. She very easily managed to locate her niece in England when she fled from Gormlaith, only for Gormlaith to eventually find her not long after.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\n==Possessions==\n*'''[[Salazar Slytherin's wand|Wand]]''': Gormlaith owned the wand of Salazar Slytherin, until it was stolen by her niece.\n*'''[[Gormlaith Gaunt's second wand|Second wand]]''': Gormlaith purchased a replacement wand from Ollivander's, which she used until her dying day.\n\n==Etymology==\n*Gormlaith is a spelling derived from the name [[Wikipedia:Gormflaith|Gormflaith]] which is an Irish name meaning \"blue or illustrious princess\". It was one of the most popular Gaelic-Irish female forenames between the 8th and 16th century.<ref name=\"Gormflaith\">{{Wikilink|Gormflaith}}</ref>\n*'Gorm' is also the Irish for 'blue' 'green' or 'grey' depending on the dialect.\n*Gaunt is a way of describing the physical appearance of someone, meaning lean, haggard or grim.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*The merchant ship ''[[Bonaventure]]'' did list a William Sayre on the passenger manifest for its 1634 voyage to Virginia.<ref name=\"Bonaventure\">[http://www.packrat-pro.com/ships/bonaventure.htm ''Bonaventure'' passenger manifest (Secundo Januarii 1634)] at [http://www.packrat-pro.com/ships/shiplist.htm Pilgrim Ship Lists Early 1600's]</ref> The listed Sayre was 58 years old at the time.\n*When she burned down [[Isolt Sayre|Isolt]]'s [[Ilvermorny Cottage|childhood home]], it is very possible she accomplished this by the means of [[Fiendfyre]], seeing as how both her sister and her brother-in-law were also possessing wands and magical ability but were unable to save themselves, yet Gormlaith could enter the burning building to 'rescue' her niece without endangering either of them, which would make sense if she controlled the [[Fire|flames]] and they could not be extinguished by the [[Water-Making Spell]].\n*Gormlaith's manner of [[death]] is described similarly to various deaths in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter film series]], particularly those of [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] and [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] in {{DH|F2}}, who like Gormlaith in the [[canon]], are physically disintegrated in the film, with their bodies reduced to mere dust and ash.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Gormlaith Gaunt}}\n*{{PM}} {{1st}}\n*{{WW}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Gaunt, Gormlaith}}\n\n[[de:Gormlaith Gaunt]]\n[[es:Gormlaith Gaunt]]\n[[fr:Gormlaith Gaunt]]\n[[uk:\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043c\u043b\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u0490\u043e\u043d\u0442]]\n[[ru:\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043c\u043b\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u041c\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0441]]\n[[pl:Gormlaith Gaunt]]\n\n[[Category:1634 deaths]]\n[[Category:16th century births]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Dark wizards]]\n[[Category:Deaths by creature]]\n[[Category:Deaths by poisoning]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Gaunt family]]\n[[Category:Historical figures]]\n[[Category:Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Murderers]]\n[[Category:Parselmouths]]\n[[Category:Pure-blood supremacists]]\n[[Category:Pure-bloods]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]"
