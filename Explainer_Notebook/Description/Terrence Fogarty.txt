Famous bearers include Publius Terentius Afer, a Roman playwright, and Marcus Terentius Varro, a Roman scholar. It was also borne by several early saints. The name was used in Ireland as an anglicised form of ''Toirdhealbhack'', but it was not in use as an English name until the late 19th century.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*This particular student was only featured in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|console versions]] of {{POA}} and the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|Nintendo DS version]] of {{HBP}}.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{Comment|Console versions}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Fogarty, Terrence}}\n[[pl:Terrence Fogarty]]\n[[fr:Terrence Fogarty]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
