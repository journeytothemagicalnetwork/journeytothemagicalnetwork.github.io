He was in at least his [[third year]] of education by the [[1996-1997 school year]], referring on occasion to [[First year|first]] and [[second year]]s as younger students. Angus became captain for [[Gryffindor]] when the [[Duelling Club]] was revived by [[Albus Dumbledore]]. Angus convinced [[Harry Potter]] to join the duelling club, and requested that he and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] show a group of watching [[first year]]s how to cast the [[Stunning Spell]] and [[Disarming Charm]], along with how to dodge [[spell]]s.<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>\n\nAngus had a rather controlling and loud personality, shouting at first years for not paying attention and demanding Ron and Harry duel; however he also was rather impressed by Harry Potter for being able to fight [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. Ron Weasley did not seem too happy to find out that Angus was the leader of the duelling club for Gryffindor when he and Harry first arrived.<ref name=\"HBPG\">{{HBP|G}}</ref>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': As the head of the [[Gryffindor]] [[Duelling Club (1990s)|Duelling Club]], Angus was a very proficient duellist, who was skilled with both the [[Stunning Spell]] and the [[Disarming Charm]], as well with the dodging of [[spell]]s in combat.<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Alannis]]\n*[[Hufflepuff Duelling Club Captain]]\n*[[Slytherin Duelling Club Captain]]\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Angus Matlock has only ever appeared in the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|video game adaptation]] of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]]'', never in any of the [[Harry Potter (book series)|novels]].\n*Angus is like other [[Wizardkind|students]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] as [[Bem]], [[Kellah]], [[Michael]] and [[Nigel Wolpert|Nigel]], purely made up for film/video game adaptations of the books.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Angus\" possibly meaning \"one strength\" derived from Irish \u00f3en \"one\" and gus \"force, strength, energy\".
