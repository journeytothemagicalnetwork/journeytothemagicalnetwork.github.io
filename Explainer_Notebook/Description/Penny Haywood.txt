[[1973]]) was an [[England|English]] [[half-blood]]<ref name=\"PennySQ\" /> [[Wizardkind|witch]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1984]]. She was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff]] house and was noted as being the most popular girl in her year.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nPenny was born in [[London]], [[Great Britain|United Kingdom]] in [[1972]] or [[1973]], to a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Penny Haywood's father|father]]<ref>{{HM|5}} onward, History of Magic Lessons in general</ref> and a [[Muggle-born]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] [[Penny Haywood's mother|mother]].<ref>{{HM|5}} onward, Defence Against the Dark Arts Lessons in general</ref> She had a younger sister named [[Beatrice Haywood|Beatrice]],<ref name=\"PennySQ\">{{HM|3|Penny for Your Thoughts}}</ref> born four years after her.<ref>{{HM|5|1}}</ref>\n\nPenny's family spent every summer in the countryside, where she also had a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] friend called [[Scarlett]].<ref name=\"PennySQ\" />\n\nAt some point in her childhood, her family lived in [[Wigtown]], which lead to Penny becoming a lover of the [[Quidditch team]] [[Wigtown Wanderers]]. She owned posters of the team before she started attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Her favourite player was [[Ethan Parkin]]. \n\nHer family also owned a garden with red roses, which she tried to [[Colour Change Charm|change to yellow]].<ref name=\"fan\">{{HM|2|Q1|1}}</ref>\n\n===Hogwarts years {{C|1984\u20131991}}===\n====First year====\nIn [[1984]], she began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff]]. She became popular during her [[first year]] at school.\n\nShe was known for her impressive academic performance in [[Potions (class)|Potions]] and her talent in [[Potion|Potion-making]].<ref>{{HM|1|6}}</ref> She later befriended [[Jacob's sibling]] and helped them create the [[Sleeping Draught]] they needed to break into the locked room, where they were looking for the [[Cursed Vaults]].<ref name=\"Ch8\">{{HM|1|8}}</ref> \n\nDuring the Hallowe'en Feast<ref>{{HM|1|Howling Hallowe'en}}</ref>, she offered to help Jacob's sibling look for Dumbledore. If they accept, they would run into [[Fenrir Greyback]] and two other werewolves. Although obviously terrified, she refused to leave Jacob's sibling's side until they begged her to run. Jacob's sibling was saved by Dumbledore's arrival. Afterwards, with some convincing from Jacob's sibling, Penny agreed to brew a [[Wolfsbane Potion]] for [[Chiara Lobosca]] despite her intense fears, and eventually even became close friends with the fellow Hufflepuff, being the only student other than Jacob's sibling to whom Chiara revealed her secret of being a werewolf.\n\n====Second year====\nPenny would help Jacob's sibling many times in their search for the Cursed Vaults, including potentially joining them and [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] in breaking into one at the end of their second year.<ref>{{HM|2|10}}</ref>\n\nPenny met Jacob's sibling in the courtyard and helped coming up with the [[Artefact Room]] for a haunt of [[Erling the Great|Erling]] during his stay in Hogwarts. When Erling went on a tour of the castle with the [[Fat Friar]], they met Penny and Jacob's sibling in the [[Charms Classroom]]. After the ghosts left, Penny worried about how Erling and Sir [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] planned to have their Deathday parties on the same night. Penny and Jacob's sibling met Nick at the [[Great Hall]] to work on the invitations, and discussed how being a ghost would be like. The pair went on to deliver the invitations, one of which was for [[Myrtle Warren]].<ref>{{HM|2|DUELLING DEATHDAY PARTIES}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Teacher Appreciation Celebration]] Penny was tasked with getting to know [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] and helped Jacob's sibling brainstorm ways for them to get to know [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] better.<ref>{{HM|2|A SPECIAL CELEBRATION OF HOGWARTS TEACHERS!}}</ref>\n\n====Third year====\n[[File:Penny Haywood facing her Boggart HM31h.png|thumb|left|250px|Penny encountering a boggart in the [[Hogwarts greenhouses]], in the shape of a werewolf]]\nIn the summer of [[1985]]<ref>The \"Penny for Your Thoughts\" side quest triggers in year 3, in which Penny says Scarlett was killed \"last year\", which can be interpreted as the summer of 1985 or 1986 (between year 1 and year 2, or between year 2 and year 3). However, in \"The Hallowe'en Feast\" side quest, which can be triggered as early as year 1, Penny mentions her friend has already been killed by a werewolf. However, as in Penny's account in \"Penny for Your Thoughts\" Penny already had a wand and was capable of doing magic with it at the time of Scarlett's death, it is unlikely it occurred in the summer prior to attending Hogwarts. On the other hand, as \"Penny for Your Thoughts\" has been removed, it can be considered that Scarlett's death may have been retconned to occur before Penny's time in Hogwarts.</ref>, a tragedy happened that would change Penny's life. Penny's family were spending their usual summer in the countryside. One night, at a full-moon, Penny and her friend [[Scarlett]] went exploring outside the house and found a [[werewolf]].\n\nIgnorant of what the [[beast]] was, Scarlett was fascinated by it and wanted to follow it to see where it might go. Penny had her wand ready, but when the werewolf finally saw them, she was at first unable to react, and when she finally did, it was too late already. The werewolf killed Scarlett, resulting in Penny blaming herself for the death of her friend.\n\nFrom then on, Penny's [[boggart]] would change into a werewolf and she even went that far as to brew a [[Forgetfulness Potion]] in her third year, intending to clear her mind of the guilt and pain she felt over her lost friend.<ref name=\"PennySQ\" />\n\nPenny helped [[Jacob's sibling]] train their [[crup]] puppy; she did not get one herself because she could not bring it home, as her father was a Muggle.<ref>{{HM|3|Puppy-Dog Tales}}</ref>\n\nDuring that year, she was especially excited to learn that [[Ethan Parkin]] was coming to visit [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] to watch his daughter [[Skye Parkin|Skye]] play in the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup]] final. She met him briefly when he came to the pre-match party to tell Skye and [[Jacob's sibling]] that the match was about to start. She got him to sign her copy of ''[[The Wonder of Wigtown Wanderers]]''.\n\n====Fourth year====\nPenny helped to teach Jacob's sibling [[Beautification Potion]] to distract a [[Red Cap]] in the [[Forbidden Forest]].\n\nShe was also attacked by a [[Dementor]]. [[Minerva McGonagall]] found her unconscious; [[Poppy Pomfrey]] speculates she may not have survived if not found just in time. At the [[Hospital Wing]], she was visited by [[Nymphadora Tonks]] and Jacob's sibling. If the latter asked what she heard, she would reveal she heard a wolf's howl and a girl's scream from her worst memory: Scarlett's death. Jacob's sibling connected the attack with the plan \"[[R]]\" has to unleash \"it\" on Hogwarts.\n\n====Fifth year====\nPenny excitedly introduced Jacob's sibling to her younger sister, [[Beatrice Haywood]], who has just started her first year, at the [[Start-of-Term Feast]]. Penny voiced her concern about young Beatrice being eager to join Jacob's sibling on their adventures, and distracted her by asking her to give them the toy [[Puffskein]] she made for them. The Haywoods then left to tour the [[Hufflepuff Common Room]] to let Jacob's sibling catch up with their other friends.<ref name=\"HM51\">{{HM|5|1}}</ref>\n\nThe sisters' happiness together was short-lived, however. When Jacob's sibling was meeting with [[William Weasley]] and [[Merula Snyde]] to discuss the [[Cursed Vaults]] in the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]], Penny burst in in a panic; Beatrice had gone missing. Penny feared she may have went into the [[Forbidden Forest]] because of the stories of curse-breaking she told her. The staff was already searching the castle, so the four of them searched the forest in pairs. Jacob's sibling could choose Penny to go with them to search [[Red Cap]]'s hole, and the [[Acromantula]] lair, where she threatened to burn down the whole lair if the spiders harmed her sister.\n\nFruitless in their search, they returned to the castle; Bill and Jacob's sibling watched in concern as Penny attempted to invent [[Legilimency potion|a potion]] - which even seventh-year Bill found more complex than anything he knew - that would grant her powerful [[Legilimency]] to locate Beatrice wherever she was. However, to her disappointment, it did not work. Jacob's sibling promised her that they would not give up.<ref name=\"HM52\">{{HM|5|2}}</ref>\n\n[[Merula Snyde]] arrived saying she found Beatrice and led them to her - trapped in a painting in the [[Grand Staircase]], leaving Penny devastated. [[Patricia Rakepick]] noted that [[Minerva McGonagall]], [[Filius Flitwick]] and herself already tried every spell they knew to no effect, and that Beatrice's perception of reality was becoming increasingly distorted. In her last moments of full coherence, Beatrice asked Jacob's sibling to take care of Penny.\n\nPenny spent part of [[History of Magic]] class brewing a potion at the back of the classroom, although the subject was considered so dull half the students decided to watch her and chat instead. She may ask Jacob's sibling to pass a note via paper plane to a fast-asleep [[Nymphadora Tonks]]. She revealed that her parents were so worried they considered sending her home, and that they were furious that Hogwarts were not doing more to save Beatrice.\n\nPenny's life began to fall apart. [[Severus Snape]], who considered her his best student, noted she was failing academically and had became resigned to being consumed by grief. Alarmed, Jacob's sibling resolved to help her stop becoming self-destructive. Even [[Merula Snyde]] reluctantly admitted to being concerned about her.\n\nJacob's sibling found her next to the portrait where Beatrice is trapped. Penny told them that Beatrice was scared, could not hear her and could only see her sometimes, and regretted letting her out of her sight and messing with the [[Cursed Vaults]]. Jacob's sibling reaffirmed their commitment to saving her, despite Penny expressing hopelessness. Penny was grateful for their support and asked them to meet her in the forest.\n\nThey found a [[unicorn horn]] as Penny believed it would be an ingredient in a potion she needed. They then found a pin cushion in the [[Transfiguration]] classroom; Jacob's sibling uses [[Reparifarge]] to transfigure it back to a porcupine so Penny could pluck its quills while they obtained [[Moonstone]] from [[Jae Kim]] as a favour, and the latter wondered why they are helping Penny. Despite only knowing him for a short time, if Jacob's sibling had a very close friendship with Penny, they may confess that they fancy Penny and that they had never told anyone. Jae advised them to tell her about their feelings.\n\nIn [[Herbology]] class, when they were preparing to gather [[Syrup of Hellebore]], Penny asked Jacob's sibling why they were always so nice to her, prompting them to blurt out that they are attracted to her. Penny was shocked and speechless; she was too occupied with her sister's plight. Jacob's sibling understood and said it could wait until she was safe, and Penny promised they would talk after that. She also thanked them profusely for their help.\n\nPenny revealed she planned on brewing a [[Draught of Peace]] to calm herself down. Jacob's sibling may choose to allow her to drink it, unwilling to see her in so much pain, or stop her, worried it may sicken her if brewed incorrectly. They may also refer to the incident with the [[Forgetfulness Potion]] in their third year.\n\nPenny thought the [[Fat Friar]] might be of help, although he directed them to [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] instead for their search on [[Marauder's Map]].\n\nPenny was present in the meeting called to discuss the vault portrait. However, when the conversation descended into a chaotic argument, the normally sociable Penny was uncharacteristically the only person out of the group of eleven to remain completely silent throughout.<ref name=\"HM512\">{{HM|5|12}}</ref> She was absent in a later meeting of Jacob's sibling's friends to catch up, where Rowan attacked the others under the control of the [[Imperius Curse]].<ref name=\"HM519\">{{HM|5|19}}</ref>\n\nPenny asked Jacob's sibling to meet her at the Grand Staircase and informed them another student was pulled into a portrait, a Third-Year that they did not know, and that Beatrice could not hear her any more. She stressed the importance of breaking the curse and asked them what to do if she were to find the vault before they did.<ref name=\"HM520\">{{HM|5|20}}</ref>\n\nAfter more other students are trapped in paintings, Penny may tell Jacob's sibling that Beatrice is getting weaker. If Jacob's sibling used [[Legilimency]] on Penny, they would find that she was reliving the moment of her finding Beatrice trapped over and over.<ref name=\"HM528\">{{HM|5|28}}</ref>\n\nWhen the time came to enter the Cursed Vault, Jacob's sibling must choose either [[Charles Weasley]] or Penny Haywood to join the team. If Charlie was chosen, Merula would complain they should have asked Penny instead. If Penny was chosen, she must be convinced at [[Hog's Head Inn]] to join; she then went to see Beatrice one more time before going with the others. Jacob's sibling may express discontent with recruiting their friends who were less prepared for the dangers.<ref name=\"HM529\">{{HM|5|29}}</ref>\n\nPenny possibly joined [[Jacob's sibling]] and his friends into the [[Buried Vault]].<ref name=\"HM530\">{{HM|5|30}}</ref>\n\nWhile Jacob's sibling was upset that their brother left them again, they were glad Penny and Beatrice were reunited. Penny asked them to meet up at the Courtyard. The sisters were very happy to be together again, and Penny said they spent much time outside after Beatrice was trapped for so long and thanked them. If Penny was at the vault, Jacob's sibling also praised her courage. They discussed Beatrice's ordeal, with Penny and Jacob's sibling reassuring her. Penny expressed her pain in being torn apart from her sister, before catching herself and apologising, remembering what happened with Jacob. When Beatrice expressed fear over a professor turning out to be evil and Penny tried to reassure her, Jacob's sibling was reminded of Merula, prompting them to leave to visit her.<ref name=\"HM531\">{{HM|5|31}}</ref>\n\nPenny attended the party at the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]] for Bill's graduation, and appeared concerned when [[Alastor Moody]] took Jacob's sibling away with Side-Along [[Apparition]], although she, along with everyone else except Rowan and Rosmerta, had already left when Jacob's sibling returned.<ref name=\"HM533\">{{HM|5|33}}</ref>\n\nPenny was with Jacob's sibling when they found a crowd in the courtyard; [[Emily Tyler]] had stolen [[Ismelda Murk]]'s diary and reading out loud all about her crush on [[Barnaby Lee]] and mocking her. Penny became upset at the scene and asked Jacob's sibling what they should do. Later, she would mention that she told [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] about Emily's behaviour.\n\nJacob's sibling may ask Penny to help Ismelda confess to Barnaby. Penny gave Ismelda various advice, and finished with telling her to be herself, although she hastily added \"minus the death threats\" after Ismelda's response.\n\nWhen Ismelda's confession did not go well on the oblivious Barnaby, she stormed off. Penny and Jacob's sibling found Ismelda and [[Jae Kim]] at the [[Grand Staircase]], and realised she planned to use a [[love potion]] on Barnaby and Penny speculates whether she should brew an antidote.\n\nPenny and Jacob's sibling confronted Ismelda and Penny pleaded her not to use it as Jae excused himself. However, she would not stop them if Jacob's sibling encouraged her to use the love potion; Penny would watch in shock as the scheme went wrong and Barnaby became infatuated with Jacob's sibling instead, and lead Barnaby away to get an antidote. If Jacob's sibling convinced Ismelda not to use the love potion, Penny would say she made the right choice, and leave to dispose of the love potion-infused sandwich.\n\nIn a [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class, Jae wondered if Penny would tell a professor about what he did. After class, Ismelda talked Jacob's sibling and accepted her rejection fairly evenly; if Penny helped Ismelda, Jacob's sibling would express gratitude for her help.<ref name=\"crushed\">{{HM|5|Crushed}}</ref>\n\nPenny studied for her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]]s this year. Due to Beatrice's situation, Penny found it very difficult to focus on her revision and considered buying cheating equipment from [[Jae Kim]] out of desperation. However, Jae had previously mentioned to Jacob's sibling that most cheaters are caught and disqualified, but he did not care; when Penny arrived to meet him, Jacob's sibling firmly told them to not make any transaction, and later helped Penny with her revision instead.\n\n====Sixth year====\nAt the [[Start-of-Term Feast]], Penny wondered where Beatrice was.<ref name=\"HM61\">{{HM|6|1}}</ref>\n\nPenny found Jacob's sibling and Merula blasting dummies after Merula swore revenge on Rakepick, and wondered why they are doing that in the dark. Merula lashed out at Penny for \"judging\" her and said she hated Penny and everyone. Penny was taken aback, but Jacob's sibling assured Penny that Merula was in a bad mood. Penny wanted to talk about Beatrice; she met with Jacob's sibling at the Three Broomsticks, clearly saddened. While hesitant, with some coaxing, she told Jacob's sibling that Beatrice spent the summer sulking, trying to act older than she was, and becoming distant from her. Beatrice had been avoiding Penny and hanging out with a new crowd. Jacob's sibling promised to talk to Beatrice.\n\nThey found Beatrice with [[Ismelda Murk]] at the courtyard. When Jacob's sibling approached, Beatrice immediately rolled her eyes and said that Penny has got to them. They argued, and Beatrice was not swayed and told them to let her be.\n\nJacob's sibling received a message that \"Miss Haywood\" needed them, incorrectly assuming it was Penny, but it was actually Beatrice who wanted them to witness the first victim of the [[Statue curse]].<ref name=\"HM62\">{{HM|6|2}}</ref>\n\nBeatrice asked Jacob's sibling to meet them at the Artefact room, where she told them to tell Penny to back off, saying she did not want to talk to her. However, Penny found them and confronted Beatrice about skipping the classes she had to retake due to being trapped for much of her first year, leading to a heated argument. Jacob's sibling attempted to excuse themself, but was stopped by both sisters. They continued to bicker with Jacob's sibling trapped between the saddened and worried Penny and the angry and rebellious Beatrice. Despite Jacob's sibling asking them not to, they are forced to take a side. Regardless of their choice, they could not stop the argument from escalating until Beatrice yelled at Penny that she wished she was not her sister and that she would \"disappear\", before storming out of the room, leaving Penny and Jacob's sibling shocked. Realising that it reminded them of Jacob, Penny apologised and attempted to console them, but they were distracted by a missing skull which they deduced may be stolen by Ben.<ref name=\"HM64\">{{HM|6|4}}</ref>\n\nWhen Bill Weasley returned to help the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class, Penny said it was great to see him again, but expressed reservations about Ben's new daredevil attitude. Penny was the first to voice support for his extra lessons, to help protect her sister and friends. During the lesson, she wondered how Bill had been since the last vault.<ref name=\"HM65\">{{HM|6|5}}</ref>\n\nWhen Jacob's sibling followed a trail to track down Jacob, Penny in the library commented she saw someone looking like him in there.<ref name=\"HM66\">{{HM|6|6}}</ref>\n\nPenny met Jacob's sibling at the courtyard, where she was eager to introduce them to [[Cedric Diggory]], but she noticed they were upset. Jacob's sibling explained they saw Jacob but he left them again, and his warning that an assassin is after them, to Penny's sympathy and shock. Jacob's sibling changed the subject back; they met Cedric and Penny said he was \"cool\", talked about among Hufflepuffs, and modest. If Jacob's sibling chose to welcome Cedric, Penny would say she knew they would get along; if they chose to challenge him, they would insult his 'perfect but humble' image as an attention-seeking act, which would start a brief argument with Penny, but in both cases they were interrupted by Sickleworth running by. Regardless of choice, Penny apologetically declined helping with the investigation as she was to introduce Cedric to the [[Potions Club]].\n\nOn the way of their hunt for Sickleworth, Jacob's sibling and [[Diego Caplan]] came across Beatrice and Ismelda tossing Puffskeins, and Beatrice accused them of spying on her for Penny, although they denied doing so. While searching, Jacob's sibling complained about Penny not helping them and Diego echoed with his disbelief that Penny would hold such a high opinion of Cedric. When Diego left to practice his duelling, Beatrice volunteered to help to prove to Penny that Hogwarts was unsafe; when they had a hard time finding Sickleworth, Beatrice mentioned how hard it was for her to hide from Penny. They then discussed Jacob and compared their relationships with their older siblings.<ref name=\"HM67\">{{HM|6|7}}</ref>\n\nWhen Jacob's sibling was meeting with [[Jae Kim]] and [[Andre Egwu]] to discuss a gift for a special client, Penny could be heard in the background worried that Beatrice was considering a nose ring.<ref name=\"HM610\">{{HM|6|10}}</ref> When Tonks jokingly suggested to put Rowan on trial for being too depressing in a History of Magic lecture on the [[Salem Witch Trials]], Penny said it was not Rowan's fault it is so sad.<ref name=\"HM610hm\">{{HM|6|10|hm}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling met Penny at the Three Broomsticks. Penny told them that Beatrice was still ignoring her, while Beatrice could be seen hanging out with Merula and Ismelda on the other side of the pub. Jacob's sibling told her of the death threat on one of their friends. Contrary to some others reactions, Penny was firm that the threat would not scare her from being their friend. Jacob's sibling had to convince her to brew a love potion for a deal they made in order to obtain an [[Invisibility cloak]] for their plan to sneak into the [[Ministry of Magic]] to retrieve [[Patricia Rakepick]]'s dark artefacts before the latter could. Penny was very apprehensive about the potion, and may bring up Ismelda's fiasco with attempting to use a love potion on Barnaby last year; she became even more agitated when Jacob's sibling mentioned sneaking into the Ministry, as she feared they would be thrown into [[Azkaban]] for the infraction. After finally being convinced, she requested Jacob's sibling to gather the ingredients.\n\nShe apparently told [[Barnaby Lee]] that Muggle parents put up good grades of their children on fridges, although the latter said his parents were in Azkaban and they did not have a fridge. When Jacob's sibling and [[Rowan Khanna]] got reacquainted and reconciled at the [[Hogsmeade station]], the latter mentioned that they knew Jacob's sibling would become popular when Penny befriended them.\n\nJacob's sibling went to the [[Artefact Room]] with the ingredients for a [[Love potion]], but was surprised by Penny's uncharacteristically flat, stony attitude and asked her what was wrong. Penny told them that due to their request, she had been thinking about the matter of [[love]]; contrary to what she previously thought, she had come to the decision that the best way to show Beatrice that she loved her was to give her space. However, during the conversation, Jacob's sibling let slip about resenting their brother for leaving them again. When [[Andre Egwu]] came in saying [[Alistair Fidgen]] was impatient, Penny bottled up the love potion quickly for the trade.<ref name=\"HM611\">{{HM|6|11}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling updated Penny and Charlie on the situation of a dark wizard escaping and likely coming after them. Charlie pointed out all their friends and their siblings may also be in danger. Penny, who was busy being worried about Jacob's sibling, did not think of that and started to reconsider her stance on Beatrice and her safety. When Charlie blamed Jacob's sibling for bringing danger to them, an angry Ben used ''[[Langlock]]'' on him. Penny was shocked and concerned; after Jacob's sibling used the [[General Counter-Spell]] to stop it, Charlie and Ben started yelling at each other and Penny begged them not to fight. However, Ben refused her attempts at reconciliation and told them to leave while he wanted to prove himself.<ref name=\"HM613\">{{HM|6|13}}</ref>\n\nAt [[Poppy Pomfrey]]'s request, Jacob's sibling asked Penny to help brew some [[Pepperup Potion]]. They thought Penny looked anxious and offered to do it themselves. While brewing, Penny revealed that she checked on Beatrice because of the threat of the escaped dark wizard, which led to another argument and their relationship becoming even worse than before. They also talked about Jacob, and Jacob's sibling responded with a more positive attitude, which also cheered Penny up.\n\nSnape found the two and told them to go to the Hospital Wing for an emergency. When they rushed in, they found that Pomfrey has been petrified. Cedric was at the scene, but was too shaken to recount his story, until Penny emphasised with him, saying her sister was trapped in a portrait and that Jacob's sibling helped her cope. After his account, Penny said how this curse was the worst of all.<ref name=\"HM614\">{{HM|6|14}}</ref>\n\nAfter a DADA tutoring session, Bill asked Jacob's sibling, Ben, Merula, and either Penny or Charlie to stay behind to discuss the Cursed Vaults (depending on who was picked to enter the Buried Vault). If Penny did not visit the Buried Vault, she would still want to stay but relented when Bill said it is best only talked about between those who had been there. If Penny stayed, she would be told along with the others about Bill thinking the last vault is underwater and they should research where exactly it could be, and also stop Ben and Merula fighting. When Jacob's sibling and Beatrice snuck out to the [[Great Lake]], Beatrice asked them whether they would tell Penny. She would be angry or relieved, but either way, she did not want to talk about Penny further.<ref name=\"HM615\">{{HM|6|15}}</ref>\n\nWhen Beatrice and Jacob's sibling met Jae at detention, Jae was surprised at how \"Penny's little sister\" looked so different. During detention, Beatrice said Penny would never get into detention. After they finished working, Penny came into the kitchens to give Jacob's sibling a message, and was shocked to see Beatrice there. Depending on their previous choice, either Jae let slip what Jacob's sibling and Beatrice were up to and their encounter with the [[Wizard in white robes]], or Jacob's sibling explained themself. Penny became incredibly worried and upset hearing the story, but Beatrice stormed off and Penny told Jacob's sibling to leave because [[Talbott Winger]] needed to see them urgently.<ref name=\"HM616\">{{HM|6|16}}</ref>\n\nWith the students confined in the castle as the Wizard in white robes is spotted nearby with [[Dementor]]s hunting for him, Penny asked [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] to teach her the [[Patronus Charm]], but he refused.<ref>{{HM|6|18}}</ref>\n\nWhen students and staff gathered to mourn the death of [[Rowan Khanna]], Penny could be seen weeping openly next to Jacob's sibling. If Penny did not go to the Buried Vault, she would say she knew why Rowan was in the forest. After Dumbledore's eulogy, they would meet at the corridor, where Penny may say she could burst into tears any moment. Penny revealed she told what she knew about 'R' and their threat to Rowan, which made the latter resolve to protect Jacob's sibling and thus followed them into the forest, and Penny blamed herself for Rowan's death. However, Jacob's sibling would blame themself or Rakepick.\n\nPenny seemed to have a particularly hard time deal with her grief, not helped by Beatrice still refusing to talk to her. When the rest of their friends decided to go to Hogsmeade, Penny wanted to stay back with Beatrice but the latter told her to go. Beatrice said she wanted to help at the Hospital Wing and Penny should be with her friends; Penny was surprised at and appreciative of her empathy and maturity. Beatrice said she did not need Penny and asked Penny to take care of herself, expressed sympathy to Penny over her friend's death, and then burst into sobs; Penny pulled her into a big hug.\n\nPenny was at Three Broomsticks when Jacob's sibling got everyone's attention and they began to reminiscence over Rowan. Afterwards, Penny and Charlie caught up with Jacob's sibling alone next to the fireplace, and the latter admitted they did not remember the last time they hung out with Rowan. Jae approached them and reminded them of the time they spent at the Hogsmeade Station, which cheered them up a little.<ref name=\"HM619\">{{HM|6|19|hm}}</ref>\n\nPenny became a founding member of the [[Circle of Khanna]], a group devoted to avenging [[Rowan Khanna]] and locating the final [[Cursed Vaults|cursed vault]]. It was at the groups first meeting in the [[Hog's Head Inn]] that she learned more of the malevolent organisation \"[[R]]\" and its [[Plot to find the Cursed Vaults|motives]] to locate the final Cursed Vault before them. Penny and Charlie already knew some of it and convinced others of its threat. Upon Ben revealing the name of the society, Penny began to cry again, saying that she thought she was done crying; Charlie told her it would only be done when 'R' was dealt with.\n\nBeatrice, who was not in the group, was found with Ismelda and Merula talking about the issue. Jacob's sibling may choose to tell Penny of her involvement, or not. Ismelda and Merula were against letting Penny know, but Penny walked in, having learned where Beatrice was from Cedric. Penny said losing Rowan made her realise how easily she could lose someone. She apologised to Beatrice for not understanding her and pleaded her not to push her away this time.

Penny was not comfortable about the others stealing ingredients, but conceded it was the only way. She was surprised that Alanza recognised they were making [[Felix Felicis]].

They gathered [[knotgrass]] in the greenhouse together.\n\nPenny met Jacob's sibling in the library and told them Snape prevented her from gathering the powdered [[Horn of Bicorn]], although Jacob's sibling was confident they could get around him. They also needed [[Moste Potente Potions]] and Penny mentioned hearing someone tricking Madam Pince to get into the [[Restricted Section]] not long ago. When asked, Jacob's sibling may tell the truth, or lie which would be immediately exposed by a nearby student, at which Penny would ask them to be honest with her in the future.

She often styled her hair differently for special occasions, including a crown braid for [[Celestial Ball]], a French braid for her potential first date with [[Jacob's sibling]], and a side French braid for Valentine's Day and the Romance Festival. She would sometimes use magic to braid her hair when in a hurry. \n\nPenny adorned different garments to special occasions (including her white and yellow [[dress robes]] at the Celestial Ball). True to her house's colours, those outfits always featured yellow prominently (with the sole exception of the [[Valentine's Day Ball]])<ref>{{HM|5|Valentine's Day Ball}}</ref>, which was also her favourite colour. However, she otherwise almost never wore anything other than her plain robes, as the standard [[Hogwarts uniform]] that is not modified or accessorised in any way, even outside class. This was in contrast to many of her schoolmates, including her dormitory mates [[Nymphadora Tonks]] and [[Chiara Lobosca]], who almost never wore the school robes outside of school. Similarly, although she would eventually gift Jacob's sibling with a potion belt when they became very close friends, she was never seen wearing it, unlike Chiara's necklace or [[Rowan Khanna]]'s glasses. In her [[seventh year]] she began wearing a casual outfit with a white shirt, blue denim jacket, yellow skirt and boots.\n\nPenny was often considered attractive, whether by a friend like [[Jacob's sibling]] or the usually mean-spirited [[Ismelda Murk]]. [[Nymphadora Tonks]] claimed that Penny was pretty enough to repel a [[Red Cap]] without the need of a [[Beautification Potion]].\n\nPenny had a somewhat shrill voice, and was prone to shrieks when startled or very excited. Multiple people mistook her screaming as that from a [[banshee]].<ref name=\"TLSQ2\">{{HM|3|Q2}}, Time-Limited Side Quest \"The Second Quidditch Cup\"</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:PennyHaywoodHM.png|250px|thumb|Penny's cheerful demeanour]]\n{{Quote|Penny is like Snape if Snape is nothing like Snape.|[[Nymphadora Tonks]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\nPenny was sociable, approachable, and pleasant; regarded as the most popular girl in her year while attending Hogwarts. As a result of her social standing and vast network of friends, she was also very well-informed about the happenings at Hogwarts. Penny was often excitable, eager to hang out and help friends, and sometimes easily distracted.\n\nShe was known to value bravery and compassion greatly, thanking [[Jacob's sibling]] for having the courage to stand up to the school bully [[Merula Snyde]]. She even befriended Jacob's sibling shortly thereafter due to, in part, their kindness towards [[Ben Copper]] and their shared love for [[potion]]s. She was very empathetic and often expressed sympathy at the plight of others, even to shunned and bullied students, and often attempted to mediate arguments. She was also good friends with [[Liz Tuttle]] and [[Talbott Winger]], who were both considered outcasts, showing that despite her popularity, she was still humble, decent and treated others very respectfully. She also befriended [[Chiara Lobosca]] and helped her manage her condition, despite Penny's crippling fear of werewolves. She was empathetic even to the frequently antagonistic [[Merula Snyde]] and [[Ismelda Murk]], willing to help them out of serious trouble.<ref name=\"Sphinx\">{{HM|3|Welcome to the Sphinx Club}}</ref><ref name=\"Crushed\">{{HM|5|Crushed}}</ref> This stood in direct contrast to [[Gryffindor]] [[Emily Tyler]], who called Penny \"too nice\"; Emily's popularity depended largely on her bullying and teasing of students she didn't like, and others only hung out with her so she wouldn't bully them. Other Hufflepuffs in her year liked Penny a lot and even said that if someone was Penny's friend, they are their friend. Some of them pretended to do poorly at [[Herbology]] just so that Penny would help them.\n\nApart from her incredible popularity and kindness, Penny was also very intelligent and [[magic]]ally gifted, as proven by her talents in potion-making, which was rivalled by very few of her fellow students, and was also competent with charm-work. While sweet-natured, she could also be a fierce and fearless protector of her friends and especially her younger sister she dearly [[love]]d.\n\nShe was an avid fan of Quidditch, especially [[Wigtown Wanderers]], her adopted hometown team, to the point that she would paint her face to the same house colour as [[Skye Parkin]], the new Quidditch Chaser from the fabled Parkin Family. Although she would never use [[Felix Felicis]] to cheat, she liked to recite the potion's ingredients as her way of wishing for luck, and ate [[horseradish]] for a week before a big Quidditch match because it was one of them.<ref>{{HM}}, Quidditch Season 1, Chapter 12</ref> In sharp contrast to her usually pacifistic demeanour, Penny was an advocate of rough play in Quidditch, to the point Jacob's sibling described her as \"bloodthirsty\".<ref name=\"TLSQ2\"></ref>\n\n{{Quote|What I'm trying to say is... I'm sorry. I should've been more understanding, [[Beatrice Haywood|Bea]]. You can yell at me, accuse me of smothering you, or even hate me if you want. But, for now, at least, please let me stay by your side. Please don't push me away. I lost Rowan. I can't lose you too.|Penny Haywood, before bursting into tears|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n\nA classic Hufflepuff, Penny was dedicated, loyal, and hardworking; however, she did exhibit darker aspects of her personality. She reacted very poorly to [[Merula Snyde]] stealing her credit, was sometimes prone to reckless potion-taking in stress or grief, and she could be stubborn and resistant to change. Her strong attachment to those close to her could cause her to be overprotective, excessively dedicated to the detriment of herself, or becoming an emotional wreck from loss. Penny could be talkative and gossipy, occasionally saying things she did not mean to. She let slip about [[Andre Egwu|Andre's]] grandmother being ill, and told Jacob's sibling they don't understand how she felt about Beatrice being trapped in a painting, despite their brother having been missing for years. However, she almost immediately realised that it was insensitive and apologised. While usually one to revel in the spotlight, she did occasionally feel the social pressure of her popularity and could be insecure about how she looked.\n\nIn her earlier years, she found it exciting that Jacob's sibling would invite her to dangerous adventures while others only invite her to parties; the tragic murders of two of her close friends and her sister's imprisonment and subsequent falling out affected her deeply. She suffered from chronic nightmares, and dipped into depression and occasional fearfulness (possibly exhibiting symptoms of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder post-traumatic stress disorder]). Despite all this, with the help of her friends, her good nature always ultimately pulled through.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n[[File:Penny Haywood making a potion HM52.png|thumb|250px|Penny making an [[Legilimency potion|experimental potion]] in the [[Potions Classroom]]]]\n*'''[[Potion]]s''': Penny had proven herself to be very skilful in this branch of [[magic]], as she achieved impressive results in [[Potions (class)|Potions class]] and often enjoyed brewing experimental mixtures in her free time. She successfully brewed the [[Sleeping Draught]] in her first year and the [[Forgetfulness Potion]] in her [[third year]], as early examples of her talent in potion-making. She was also capable of brewing the advanced [[Draught of Peace]] in her [[fifth year]] with the help of [[Jacob's sibling]], which she did with success, showing her considerable proficiency in this subtle magical art and [[science]]. Other potions she made or claimed to make included [[Wolfsbane Potion]], [[Polyjuice Potion]] and the [[Animagus potion]], all of which were highly advanced and further testament to her skill in this field. Indeed, [[Severus Snape]] himself openly acknowledged Penny to be his most gifted student in the subject, and deemed her the only one eligible to receive a private lesson from him on the highly advanced field of [[Alchemy (class)|Alchemy]].\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Penny was rather good with charm-work, as she was capable of successfully casting the [[Fire-Making Spell]],<ref name=\"HMy2ch8\">{{HM|2|8}}</ref> [[Colour Change Charm]] along with the [[Knockback Jinx]], showing she was skilled with the casting of such charms.\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': Penny was a proficient duellist and would sometimes duel Jacob's sibling.\n*'''[[Healing magic]]''': Penny had some skill in the field of healing, as she was able to successfully cast the ''[[Episkey]]'' [[healing spell]].\n*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Penny was shown to be possess a degree of skill in the Dark Arts, being able to successfully cast [[dark charm]]s such as the [[Knockback Jinx]], the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] and the [[Ear-Shrivelling Curse]].\n*'''[[Herbology]]''': Penny was skilled in Herbology, as she was able to achieve an O.W.L. in the subject and study it further at N.E.W.T.-level, thus showing aptitude in the subject.<ref name=\"HM62h\">{{HM|6|2|h}}</ref>\n*'''[[Astronomy (class)|Astronomy]]''': Penny was skilled in Astronomy, as she was able to achieve an O.W.L. in the subject and study it further at N.E.W.T.-level, thus showing aptitude in the subject.<ref name=\"HM625a\"/>\n*'''[[History of Magic]]''': Penny was skilled in History of Magic, as she was able to achieve an O.W.L. in the subject and study it further at N.E.W.T.-level, thus showing aptitude in the subject.\n*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Penny eventually learned how to ably cast the [[Lovebird to Love Note]] spell in her fifth year, and was also able to cast both the [[Transforming Spells|transforming spell]] ''[[Vera Verto]]'' and the Feather Duster to Ferret [[switching spell]] successfully in her O.W.L exam.\n*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Penny was skilled in Defence Against the Dark Arts, as she was to achieve an O.W.L. in the subject and study it further at N.E.W.T.-level, thus showing aptitude in the subject.\n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Penny had some skill in flying as she constantly took flying lessons with Jacob's sibling, although she had a fear of heights.\n*'''Social Networking''': Due to her remarkably pleasant and affable nature, Penny was able to easily befriend most people at Hogwarts and swiftly establish a rapport with them, which quickly earned her a long-standing reputation for being the most popular girl in her year, to the point that she is known for knowing all the gossip travelling at Hogwarts. This was notable through her awareness of the reason behind [[Merula Snyde]]'s antics, [[Ben Copper]]'s cowardice, [[Jacob's sibling]]'s public scrutiny, and [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s school departures. Despite being frequently well-informed and thus being renowned for knowing everybody at Hogwarts, however, Penny's network and social contacts were not always a perfect source of information, as she was unfamiliar with abrasive [[Portrait of a Quidditch player|Quidditch player]] [[Erika Rath]], and had never heard of famed [[Curse-Breaker]] [[Patricia Rakepick]] up until the latter's arrival at Hogwarts.\n\n==Possessions==\n*'''[[Penny Haywood's wand|Wand]]''': Penny owned a [[wand]], which had a [[Unicorn hair]] [[Wand core|core]], but was of an unknown length and [[Wand wood|wood]]. She likely purchased her wand from [[Ollivanders]] in [[Diagon Alley]], prior to starting her [[first year]] at Hogwarts in [[1984]], and wielded her wand throughout her school life.\n*'''''[[Advanced Potion-Making]]''''': Penny owned a copy of Advanced Potion-Making that [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Aur\u00e9lie Dumont]] borrowed to learn more about [[Alchemy]] and to help them in their search for [[Nicolas Flamel]]'s artefact in the [[1985\u20131986 school year]].\n*'''''[[The Wonder of Wigtown Wanderers]]''''': Penny owned a copy that is signed by [[Ethan Parkin]].<ref name=\"TLSQ2\"></ref>\n*'''[[Dress robes]]''': Penny wore a set of dress robes to the [[Celestial Ball]]. They were a two piece with a white sleeveless top, trimmed with silver and yellow layered tulle with a black beaded necklace.\n*'''[[Wizard's Chess]] set''': Penny owned a set which she allowed [[Jacob's sibling]] to borrow.\n\n==Etymology==\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_(given_name) Penny] is an an English diminutive of the Greek name Penelope, which is derived from \"p\u0113n\u0113\" meaning woven cloth and \"lep\u014d\" meaning \"to peel\", so basically Penny means \"unraveling cloth\".\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haywood_(surname) Haywood] is a habitational name from any of various places, for example in Herefordshire.

While all romance options gain unique outfits and occasionally other appearance changes, Penny is the only one whose hairstyle changes noticeably in every dating side quest (except An Enchanted Kiss where none have unique outfits). In 2021 she was remodelled with a casual outfit which composed of a shirt with a denim jacket and a skirt.\n*Penny's Celestial Ball appearance varied prior to release, with concept art showing her dress to be entirely yellow, and leaked model showing her wearing what appears to be a golden laurel wreath.\n*In her fifth year, Snape's criticism of her handling of Beatrice's situation echoed his remarks towards then-fifth year [[Harry Potter]] on the principles of [[Occlumency]], considering them weak for being openly emotional and wallowing in their grief. However, given that Snape's loyalties ultimately lay with the protagonists, this could be seen as having been for their own good; after hearing that, Harry did understand the importance of and eventually succeeded in blocking his connection with Voldemort, and Jacob's sibling was spurred to support Penny and prevent her from a path of self-destruction.\n*Jacob's sibling may choose Penny to accompany them in their search for the [[Vault of Ice]]; if she is chosen. she will use a [[Strengthening Solution]] to allow herself to tear open a frozen door.\n*Starting from her first Valentine's Day model (including all later dating sidequests and her casual wear), Penny's eye colour changes from a dark periwinkle to a noticeably lighter Robin's egg blue.\n*Penny owned a copy of [[Advanced Potion-Making]] that she had scribbled notes all over to the point of needing a fresh copy, much like [[Severus Snape's copy of Advanced Potion-Making|Severus Snape's copy]].<ref>{{HM|3|Become an Animagus}}</ref>\n*In her [[Hippogriff Club]] quiz encounter, the correct answer to \"What plant is kelp related to?\" is \"Seaweed.\" In real life, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelp kelp] is a type of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaweed seaweed], and neither are plants; they are [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae algae], a group of organisms that have existed for hundreds of millions of years before land plants appeared.\n*Penny has appeared in various advertisements of {{HM}} with various levels of canon adherence.
