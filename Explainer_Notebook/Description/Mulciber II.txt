After graduating from Hogwarts, he became a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]].\n\nMulciber fought in several battles during the [[First Wizarding War]]. He was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] after [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s first downfall, but escaped after Lord Voldemort's [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return]] in [[1995]]. During the [[Second Wizarding War]], Mulciber fought at the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] with a group of Death Eaters, attempting to take a [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|prophecy]] from [[Harry Potter]]. After the battle, he was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]], but escaped in [[1997]]. It is possible that he fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], too.\n\nAfter the Second Wizarding War and Lord Voldemort's final defeat at the hands of [[Harry Potter]] in [[1998]], he was presumably killed or imprisoned again in Azkaban.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nMulciber attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1970s]]. He and his friend [[Avery II|Avery]] enjoyed playing cruel pranks on their fellow students, including [[Mary Macdonald]], on whom Mulciber attempted to use [[Dark Arts|Dark Magic]] during the [[1975]]-[[1976]] school year. Mulciber was also a friend of [[Severus Snape]], which upset [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]], who was Snape's best friend at the time. She found Mulciber's sense of humour to be very sadistic and did not understand how Severus could associate with someone like him.<ref name=\"DH33\">{{DH|B|33}}</ref>\n\n===First Wizarding War===\nMulciber eventually joined the [[Death Eaters]] alongside his schoolmates Snape and Avery. It is likely that he is the Mulciber whom [[Igor Karkaroff]] tried to turn in to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in exchange for his own release, telling the [[Wizengamot]] that he specialised at the [[Imperius Curse]] and had forced people to do horrific things. To his dismay, Karkaroff was told that Mulciber had already been caught.<ref name=\"GOF30\">{{GOF|B|30}}</ref>\n\n===Second Wizarding War===\nIn [[1996]] with the revolt of the [[Dementor]]s, Mulciber [[Azkaban escapes#1996|escaped]] Azkaban along with nine other Death Eater prisoners.\n\nLater that year, he participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] and was paired with [[Lucius Malfoy]]. It's unknown if he encountered the children during the chase, but he likely fought the [[Order of the Phoenix]] when they came to the rescue. After the battle, he was captured once more.<ref name=\"OOTP35\">{{OOTP|B|35}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible that he escaped along with other Death Eaters in [[1997]] and that he fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. If he did, he probably either died or was imprisoned again in [[Azkaban]].\n\n==Personality and traits==\nEven as a boy at Hogwarts, [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]] said Mulciber was \"creepy\" and had an \"evil\" sense of humour. She seemed to think he was worse than [[Avery (Marauder-era)|Avery]]. He enjoyed playing cruel pranks on other students, showing a sadistic streak.<ref name=\"DH33\"/>\n\nLily also referred to Mulciber and Avery as \"Death Eaters\" before they officially joined Voldemort, indicating that they had already an acknowledged interest in the [[Dark Arts]] and [[pure-blood supremacy]].<ref name=\"DH33\"/>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Dark Arts]]:''' Being a Death Eater, Mulciber would have been proficient in dark magic. According to [[Igor Karkaroff]], Mulciber specialised in the [[Imperius Curse]], forcing people to do many frightening things.<ref name=\"GOF30\"/> It is possible that he attempted to use the same [[curse]] on [[Mary Macdonald]], during his time at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': Mulciber participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] with his fellow Death Eaters, meaning he would have presumably been at least a fairly competent and skilled duellist. However, he was recaptured after participating in the aforementioned battle.<ref name=\"OOTP35\"/> He most likely took part in other battles as well, such as the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. \n\n==Etymology==\nMay refer to [[Wikipedia:Mulciber|Mulciber]] (Hephaestus), meaning \"smelter\", is an alternate name for the gentle son of Hera and husband of Aphrodite, who had a club foot and was a craftsman and balcksmith in Greek mythology. In Roman mythology he is the god of fire and metallurgy, Vulcan. More likely Rowling is making a reference to  a character in John Milton's ''[[Wikipedia:Paradise Lost|Paradise Lost]]'', Mulciber, a story based on mankind falling into sin and the struggle of heaven and hell. Mulciber was a fallen angel who is the architect of Pandemonium, the capital of Hell and home to the demons' council.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*One of the earliest [[Death Eaters]] to have joined [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] was also named [[Mulciber (Riddle-era)|Mulciber]]. The [[Mulciber family|relationship]] of the two is unclear, but, given the timeline, it is most likely that they were father and son. However, the references to both Mulcibers are hard to separate and thus it is possible that Karkaroff accused the older Mulciber rather than the younger.\n*Despite being a friend of both Snape and Avery he is not one of the names mentioned by Sirius Black when he was listing [[Gang of Slytherins|Snape's school gang]]. It's unknown why he was excluded, though it's possible that there were other members not mentioned by Sirius.\n*Mulciber may have been the one to be hit by Ginny with Reducto in the film adaptation of {{OOTP}}. Also, it was either him, Avery, Macnair, or Lucius who had Pluto blown up in his face by Luna with Reducto in the book (though whoever it was probably survived).\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{GOF}} {{1st Mention}}\n*{{OOTP}} {{1st}}\n*{{DH}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Death Eaters}}\n\n[[de:Mulciber jr.]]\n[[es:Mulciber (Era de los Merodeadores)]]\n[[fr:Mulciber (\u00e9poque de Severus Rogue)]]\n[[pl:Mulciber (Era Huncwot\u00f3w)]]\n[[pt-br:M\u00falciber (Era de Severo Snape)]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0438\u0431\u0435\u0440]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:Azkaban escapees]]\n[[Category:Battle of the Department of Mysteries participants]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Death Eaters]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts students during the Marauders' era]]\n[[Category:Mulciber family]]\n[[Category:Pure-blood supremacists]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Unforgivable curse users]]"
