[[1917]] \u2013 [[1981]]) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[wizardkind|witch]] and daughter of [[Isobel Ross's father|Mr]] and [[Isobel Ross's mother|Mrs Ross]]. She married [[Robert McGonagall Senior|Robert McGonagall]] and became the mother of [[Minerva McGonagall|Minerva]], [[Malcolm McGonagall|Malcolm]], and [[Robert McGonagall Junior|Robert Jnr]].<ref name=\"pottermore\">{{WW|professor-mcgonagall}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nIsobel was born to [[Isobel Ross's father|Mr]] and [[Isobel Ross's mother|Mrs Ross]], a wizard and witch, and grew up in a village in [[Scotland]] alongside many [[Non-magic people|Muggles]]. When she turned eleven, she started attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Her Muggle neighbours were under the impression that she had been sent off to an exclusive all-girls boarding school in England. During her time at Hogwarts she excelled in [[Charms (class)|Charms]], graduating top of her class in the subject. She was also [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] of the school [[Quidditch]] [[Quidditch team|team]].<ref name=\"pottermore\" />\n\nAt some point during her teens, Isobel became romantically involved with [[Robert McGonagall]], a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] who lived in the same village. However, since she knew her parents would disapprove of the relationship, she kept it a secret from them.<ref name=\"pottermore\" />\n\n===Marriage and family===\nDeeply in love, Isobel (then aged eighteen) and Robert decided to elope, angering both sets of parents. Mr and Mrs Ross were so upset that they completely severed ties with their daughter. On the honeymoon, Isobel could not bear to tell her new husband she was a witch, and so the fact remained a secret.<ref name=\"pottermore\" />\n\nIsobel moved with Robert to a manse on the edge of [[Caithness]]. She proved skilled at making the most of the small income he earned as a Presbyterian minister.<ref name=\"pottermore\" />\n\nThe couple's first child, a daughter, arrived on [[4 October]]. Isobel, missing her family and the [[wizarding world|magical world]] she left behind in the name of love, named the baby Minerva in honour of her own grandmother, a powerful witch. The residents of Caithness found this name extremely unusual and Reverend McGonagall found it very difficult to explain to the members of his congregation why Isobel had chosen it.<ref name=\"pottermore\" />\n\nAfter Minerva's birth, Isobel became moody, alarming her husband. When Robert consulted his friends, they told him that post-partum depression was not uncommon for new mothers to go through, and that it would soon pass. However, Isobel only grew more withdrawn, sometimes hiding away with Minerva for days on end.<ref name=\"pottermore\" />\n\nWhat Isobel was actually trying to do was keep Robert from catching sight of any of the subtle signs of being magic that Minerva had displayed from her very first hours of life. One night, she finally broke down under her husband's gentle questioning, and, in tears, retrieved her [[Isobel McGonagall's wand|wand]] from where it was hidden and showed him she was a witch. Robert, while shocked by this revelation, did not love Isobel any less after it. Isobel also explained how she was bound to keep the existence of the wizarding world secret from Muggles by [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]].<ref name=\"pottermore\" />\n\nWhile the couple still loved each other afterwards, they never regained the sense of trust they once shared, something which Minerva, a very bright, observant child, recognised.<ref name=\"pottermore\" />\n\nIsobel and her husband eventually welcomed two more children: [[Malcolm McGonagall|Malcolm]] and [[Robert McGonagall Junior|Robert Jnr]]. In time, both proved to be magical, and Minerva readily helped her mother teach them that they could not go around showing off their magical powers, and helped her cover up the accidents their magic sometimes caused.<ref name=\"pottermore\" />\n\nIsobel wept when Minerva's Hogwarts acceptance letter came, not only from pride, but envy. While Minerva was closest to her father due to their similarities in temperament, she sympathised with the difficulty her mother faced in having to blend into an all-Muggle village, and in being apart from other people like herself and having to restrain the use of her powers.<ref name=\"pottermore\" />\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Isobel graduated [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] at the top of her [[Charms (class)|Charms]] class,<ref name=\"pottermore\" /> meaning she must have achieved excellent results in this subject and been highly proficient with this branch of [[magic]].\n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Isobel played as a Quidditch Captain in her youth at Hogwarts,<ref name=\"pottermore\" /> meaning she would have been an excellent [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{PM}} {{1st Mention}}\n*{{WW}} {{Mention}}\n*{{HM}} {{Mention}}\n*{{WU}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ross, Isobel}}\n\n[[de:Isobel McGonagall]]\n[[fr:Isobel Ross]]\n[[es:Isobel McGonagall]] \n[[ru:\u0418\u0437\u0430\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441]]\n[[pl:Isobel McGonagall]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Married individuals]]\n[[Category:McGonagall family|Isobel]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Quidditch Captains]]\n[[Category:Ross family|Isobel]]\n[[Category:Scottish individuals]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
