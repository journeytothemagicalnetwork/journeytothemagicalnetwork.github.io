He also provided a number of controlled magical ingredients to [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]], which helped them set up their magic joke shop.

Sirius Black, revealing this to Harry, said that Mundungus was heavily veiled and disguised as a witch because he had previously been barred from the Hog's Head, and admitted that Mundungus had been tailing Harry.<ref name=\"OP17\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Christmas]] of 1995, Mundungus managed to attend [[Christmas]] dinner at [[12 Grimmauld Place]] with the Order, in time for [[Christmas pudding]] and [[trifle]], having stolen a Muggle [[car]] to get there, as the [[London Underground]] did not run on [[25 December|Christmas Day]]. Mundungus also provided a [[Christmas tree]] for the house, which he also likely stole.<ref name=\"OOTP23\">{{OOTP|B|23}}</ref>\n\n====Imprisonment and escape====\nApparently, since the death of Sirius in [[1996]], Mundungus had been clearing valuables out of the headquarters of the Order and selling them. Harry caught Fletcher red-handed in [[Hogsmeade]] selling Black family silver to [[Aberforth Dumbledore|the bartender]] of the Hog's Head, which had been stolen from Sirius' house; these items and the entire residence at [[12 Grimmauld Place]] were left to Harry in Sirius' will.

The bartender, [[Aberforth Dumbledore]], said that it had been sold to him by Mundungus, and he had been using it from time to time to keep an eye on what Harry was doing.<ref name=\"DH28\"/>\n\nWhen Harry relived [[Severus Snape]]'s memories, he saw the portrait of Albus Dumbledore, in conference with Snape, developing the plan of having multiple mock Potters to allow the escape from Privet Drive. Dumbledore said that this is Harry's only chance of escape, as Snape must give Voldemort Harry's true departure date to stay in Voldemort's inner council, and suggested that Mundungus should be the one to mention it to the Order. A memory was seen of Snape, in a pub, placing a [[Confundus Charm]] on Mundungus in order to have him propose a plan of six Order members disguising themselves as Harry with [[Polyjuice Potion]] accompanied by protectors.<ref name=\"DH33\">{{DH|B|33}}</ref>\n\n===Later life===\nFletcher presumably went into hiding after his encounter with the trio at Grimmauld Place. He was not known to have taken part in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], but it is possible that he did, without being noticed by Harry Potter. Mundungus survived the war and returned to his affairs as a disliked dealer of artefacts.\n\n====Calamity====\nDuring the [[Calamity]], Mundungus often came into the field of view of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force|SOS Task Force]]. He taught volunteers several \"subtleties he learned from spotting vulnerabilities in his marks\", and at [[Hog's Head Inn]] he revealed \"the art of surprise\".<ref name=\"WU\">{{WU}}</ref>\n\nMundungus attempted to sell a load of \"found\" classics to the school. He also flooded the market with substandard [[Re'em]] blood - cut with common Ox blood. [[Calamity Investigator]]s shut down this operation. Mundungus attempted to steal from the Task Force a crate of ill-gotten [[Leaping Toadstool]]s, but fled after a fierce but brief duel.<ref name=\"WU\"/>\n\nBy at least the [[2010s]], Mundungus claimed to have created song named [[Solowithmio]], and gave a performance of it to a crowd that contained a Calamity Investigator for the SOS Task Force. Unable to actually play the guitar, Fletcher was able to convince the entire crowd that he was a skilled guitarist by slipping a [[Mundungus Fletcher's potion|potion]] into the crowd's drinks. The Calamity Investigator eventually discovered this and forced Fletcher to return all of the money he had made from the \"performance\" to the attendees, and to teach the Calamity Investigator the brewing secrets that he used to brew the potion.<ref name=\"WU\"/>\n\n==Physical appearance==\nMundungus was a short wizard with bandy legs and long, straggly ginger hair.<ref name=\"OP2\">{{OOTP|B|2}}</ref> He had bloodshot, baggy<ref name=\"OP2\"/> brown<ref name=\"HPLE\"/> eyes and rarely shaved.<ref name=\"OP2\"/> His hands were quite grubby, and he was noted to have a particularly strong bodily odour of tobacco and [[alcohol]].<ref name=\"OP5\"/> \n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Mundungus|Sirius?

He always took valuable things from wherever he went, such as [[12 Grimmauld Place]]. After [[Sirius Black]]'s death, Mundungus stole his possessions, including [[Slytherin's Locket|Salazar Slytherin's Locket]]. He was also somewhat cowardly, as he abandoned [[Alastor Moody]] during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]; Moody was killed by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] immediately afterwards. It is possible that Mundungus fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], because, if he did, he most likely survived the war and continued his work as an disreputable artefact dealer.\n\nHowever, Mundungus appeared to be braver than people such as [[Peter Pettigrew]]. Though he had a tendency to flee when the situation seemed grim, he never actually turned against the Order of the Phoenix. Also, his crimes mainly included stealing and robbing, never directly harming or killing others, meaning he was capable of some amount of compassion and decency. He was capable of loyalty and repaying debts, if only to Dumbledore.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n{{Quote|There was a bang, and Harry felt his hands fly off Mundungus\u2019s throat.

Be it an enchanted car or simply detailed information on the black market, Mundungus was a rather resourceful in his ability get his hands on whatever the [[Order of the Phoenix]] required of him. Both as a thief and informant, Mundungus was not the kind of wizard to let something useful to him or his allies out of his reach. This tendency, however, has made him a character of ill repute despite his contributions to his allies.\n*'''Music''': Mundungus had some skills as an amateur musician and songwriter, having written a song titled \"[[Solowithmio]]\". However, he lacked the ability to play the guitar well, and had to use a [[Mundungus Fletcher's potion|potion]] to convince a crowd of people that he was in fact a skilled guitarist.<ref name=\"WU\"/>\n\n==Possessions==\n[[File:MundungusFletcherWandNN8240.jpg|thumb|Mundungus's wand]]\n*'''[[Mundungus Fletcher's wand|Wand]]''': Mundungus owned a [[wand]], which was of an unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] material. He likely purchased his wand from [[Ollivanders]] in [[Diagon Alley]] prior to starting his first year of [[magic]]al education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He wielded his wand throughout his adulthood, both for his career as an antiques dealer and as a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]].\n*'''[[Invisibility cloak]]''': Mundungus Fletcher owned an Invisibility Cloak, which he used to make himself [[Invisibility|invisible]] in precarious situations.

They did not like him, as he was a criminal, but put up with him as his criminal contacts could give him intelligence about [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. [[Molly Weasley|Mrs Weasley]] seemed to dislike him, as she thought he would be a bad influence on [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]] by telling them about his \"jobs\" (probably because she was afraid of her children following his example). She also told him not to smoke in the kitchen of [[12 Grimmauld Place]]. However, she stopped disliking him so much when Mundungus saved [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] from a magic cloak that attempted to strangle him. [[Arabella Figg]] disliked him too, when he abandoned his mission to watch [[Harry Potter]], who was attacked by [[Dementor]]s. Mundungus was regarded by many as a coward. He seemed to be intimidated by [[Alastor Moody]] and protested having to partner with him during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]. While he seemed to get along well with [[Sirius Black]], this didn't stop him from stealing Black family heirlooms following Sirius's death.\n\nIn 1997, [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] kidnapped Mundungus in order to learn about [[Slytherin's Locket|Salazar Slytherin's Locket]]. Mundungus told them that he had given the locket to [[Dolores Umbridge]]. This led to Harry, Ron, and Hermione infiltrating the Ministry in order to find the locket and destroy it.\n\nThe members of the Order learned about Mundungus's cowardice when he abandoned [[Alastor Moody]] during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]; Moody was killed by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. It is unknown if Mundungus fought along with other members during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].\n\nMundungus also has a mixed relationship with the bartender of the [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], [[Aberforth Dumbledore]]. While Aberforth banned Mundungus for life from the bar for offending him twenty years ago, the two remained in touch, with Mundungus selling stolen goods to Aberforth. It was also mentioned that Mundungus was loyal to [[Albus Dumbledore]], who had helped him at some point in the past. Albus scared Mundungus a bit but nevertheless, Mundungus never betrayed him.\n\n===Fred and George Weasley===\nMundungus seemed to have a good relationship with [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]]. He smuggled them items for their joke shop, [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] in [[Diagon Alley]], behind their [[Molly Weasley|mother's]] back, including [[Venomous Tentacula]] seed, for which he charged them ten [[Galleon]]s. Fred and George nicknamed him \"Dung\".\n\n==Etymology==\n*Mundungus is an obsolete term for a malodorous tobacco.\n*A fletcher is an arrow-maker; one of his ancestors in the male line may have made arrows.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Mundungus Fletcher LEGOY2.png|thumb|Mundungus Fletcher as he appears in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]\n*Mundungus Fletcher was played by [[Andy Linden]] in {{DH|F1}}.<ref name=\"AndyasMundungus\">'''[http://harrypotterupdate.multiply.com/journal/item/275/Half-Blood_Prince_co-actor_confirms_Andy_Linden_as_Mundungus_Fletcher_in_Deathly_Hallows The Daily Potter]''': ''Half-Blood Prince co-actor confirms Andy Linden as \"Mundungus Fletcher\" in Deathly Hallows''</ref> [[Daniel Radcliffe]], of course, played Mundungus during the \"Seven Potters\" scene.

He is described as having shaggy hair, bandy legs and bloodshot eyes. In the film he is bald, has normal legs and his eyes are not bloodshot.\n*Mundungus doesn't ever appear in the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|fifth film]]. It is unknown why J.K. Rowling never told the filmmakers to do so when she told them to include [[Kreacher]], as Mundungus, like Kreacher, has a big part to play in the adventure with the locket by giving it to Umbridge. One possible explanation is that Mundungus's character was much easier to introduce later on.\n*It is possible that Mundungus appears only for a brief second in {{DH|F2}}. His possible appearance is the bald man behind Bill Weasley when he is being comforted by [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]] because they and the rest of the [[Weasley family]] are mourning [[Fred Weasley|Fred]]'s death.\n*Elizabeth Tassel, a major character in [[J.
