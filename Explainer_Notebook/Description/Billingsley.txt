He appeared to be a very popular student who was proficient in both [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] and [[Charms (class)|Charms]] classes, which many other students spoke about often.\n\n==Biography==\nBillingsley started attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in [[1983]] or [[1984]].<ref name=\"age\" /> He became very well known for the many ways he [[Transfiguration|transfigured]] objects, which was spoken about and often admired in [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] class by [[Jacob's sibling]]'s year.\n\nBillingsley's many achievements include turning a satchel to a [[goat]], the [[Minerva McGonagall|teacher]]'s desk to a ball of yarn, and himself to a surfboard which made McGonagall very upset with him. In an unknown way, Billingsley's head was once trapped in an umbrella flower.<ref>[https://mobile.twitter.com/samantha_kasa/status/998098756791762944/photo/3 Twitter]</ref> He also [[Levitation Charm|levitated]] himself and the staff was unable to get him down for some time.<ref>{{HM|1|5|c}} (see [https://youtu.be/uFcabB4K5CM?t=188 this video])</ref>\n\nHe was less skilled with charms-work, however. In his [[first year]], he recited an [[incantation]] incorrectly (presumably for the [[Fire-Making Spell]]), and accidentally set [[fire]] to the [[Boathouse]]. He also once spilled some [[Swelling Solution]] on the hands of [[Potions Master]] [[Severus Snape]].\n\nIn the [[1988\u20131989 school year]], Billingsley accidentally [[Transfiguration|Transfigured]] a [[ferret]] into a fountain instead of a feather duster. During the same year, [[Andre Egwu]] noted that animals seemed to hate Billingsley. <ref>{{HM|5|5|t}}</ref> Later that year, Jacob's Sibling also recalled that [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] had made him dust her chalkboard after he transfigured her hat.<ref>{{HM|5|11}} -  Transfiguration Lesson \"Switch: Piggy Bank and Guinea Pig\"</ref> He also performed the [[Exploding Charm]] during breakfast, splattering [[egg]]s and [[bacon]] everywhere.<ref>{{HM|5|1}} -  Charms Class \"Bombarda Review\"</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]], sometime during [[1989\u20131990 school year]] Billingsley showed up to class in his jim jams.<ref>{{HM|6|25}} - Care of Magical Creatures Class \"Jackalope\"</ref>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Billingsley was proficient with charm-work, with his skills in this field of [[magic]] often being discussed by other Hogwarts students. He was a high academic achiever in [[Charms (class)|Charms class]], and was able to perform many charms successfully, albeit sometimes recklessly, such as the [[Exploding Charm]].\n*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': This highly advanced and difficult branch of [[magic]] was Billingsley's main area of expertise, being reputed for his excellent skills in this field. He was capable of [[Transforming Spells|transforming]] many objects, including numerous animals as well. He was known to be a top academic achiever in [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] class, testament to his talent.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{HM}} {{1st Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[es:Billingsley]]\n[[fr:Billingsley]]\n[[Category:1970s births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
