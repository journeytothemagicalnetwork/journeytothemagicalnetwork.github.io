In an attempt to force Neville to be more cooperative, [[Auror]] [[John Dawlish]] was ordered to capture Augusta and take her hostage to ensure Neville's behaviour.

She was angry when she realised Neville had never told anyone about why he lived with her, thinking that he was ashamed of his parents. Nevertheless, Augusta grew proud of her grandson after discovering how dedicated he was to defeating Lord Voldemort. She was civil towards [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] when she met them in St Mungo's.<ref name=\"OOTP23\"/> She might be somewhat biased towards what she is proud of, as she found her grandson's initial lack of talent as a failure of inheriting his father's prestige, and looked down on the idea of Neville studying [[Charms (class)|charms class]], simply because she failed her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] in this subject herself, and instead favoured [[Transfiguration (class)|transfiguration]], most likely due to her own skill and success in it.<ref name=\"HBP9\"/>\n\nShe seemed to have a very strong judgement of morality, as she chose to believe Harry and [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s honest claims that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had [[Return of Lord Voldemort|returned]] over the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry's]] incredibly biased and dishonest denial. She even ceased her subscription of the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' in angry protest for backing the Ministry's [[Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter|campaign to antagonise the truth]].<ref name=\"OOTP11\"/>\n\nDespite her elderly age (as Neville described her as a \"little old witch, living alone\"), she showed tremendous loyalty, bravery and logical thinking, as she easily and swiftly defeated the much younger [[Auror]] [[John Dawlish]] who was holding her hostage and fled,<ref name=\"DH29\"/> and participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] without fear nor hesitancy.<ref name=\"DH31\"/>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n{{Quote|I really saw Mrs Longbottom as a powerful witch.|[[J.

Despite the fact that she failed her [[Charms (class)|Charms]] [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L]], Augusta must have been proficient enough in the various protective enchantments needed to survive whilst she was on the run.

During the early years of Neville's life, Augusta often thought that Neville was a [[Squib]] and was afraid he would not get into [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. She was extremely proud when he did but it was apparent that Augusta placed high expectations on Neville and was yet to be certain that he had substantial power.\n\nAugusta often reprimanded her grandson and sent Neville a [[Howler]] on at least two occasions.<ref name=\"COS5\">{{COS|B|5}}</ref><ref name=\"POA14\">{{POA|B|14}}</ref> She pushed Neville to be like his parents by doing well in school, especially in [[Transfiguration]] (a class Neville hated).<ref name=\"HBP9\"/> However, Neville loved Augusta and she cared a great deal for him, however stern she could be.\n\nIn later years, she became proud of Neville as she realised how excellent a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and moral person he was. She was shown commenting in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' about his powers and during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], she was proud to fight alongside him.<ref name=\"DH31\"/> After the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]] Neville married Hannah Abbott though it is unknown whether they had any children. Neville also replaced [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] as the [[Herbology]] professor at Hogwarts, which would have truly made his grandmother proud.<ref name=\"DHE\"/>\n\n===Frank and Alice Longbottom===\n[[File:Frank1.jpg|223x223px|thumb|[[Frank Longbottom]], her son]]\n\n{{Quote|Well, your grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause....

After the [[Attack on Frank and Alice Longbottom|attack]], Mrs Longbottom seemed to [[love]] her son and daughter-in-law, often taking Neville to visit them at [[St Mungo's]]. However, at times, she seemed to tire of providing for them, as she sounded weary when speaking to Alice and advised Neville to throw away a gum wrapper Alice gave him.

Augusta was utterly disgusted by then Ministry of Magic's blatantly dishonest slandering of Dumbledore and quickly cancelled her Daily Prophet subscription over her anger at them publishing Ministry propaganda.
