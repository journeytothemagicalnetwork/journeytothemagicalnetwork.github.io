It is ultimately derived from Old English stig \"house\" and weard \"guard\". As a given name, it arose in 19th-century [[Scotland]] in honour of the Stuart royal family, which produced several kings and queens of [[Scotland]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]] between the 14th and 18th centuries.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{COS|G}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Duelling Club}}\n[[es:Stewart]]\n[[fr:St\u00e9phane]]\n[[pl:Stewart]]\n\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Brown-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Duelling Club members]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
