When Abbott informed [[Harry Potter]] that he would need to ask a Hufflepuff student for the password in order to use his shortcut, Harry Potter had no difficulty doing this, as most Hufflepuffs had immense respect for him due to his loyalty to the late [[Cedric Diggory]] during the [[Triwizard Tournament]].<ref name=\"OP\" /> There was another set of portraits of him, hiding another hidden passageway between the [[Clock Tower]] and the corridor outside the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]]; the password needed to gain access to this shortcut was \"''Tempus neminem manet''\".<ref name=\"OP GBA\">{{OOTP|G}} - GBA version</ref>\n\n===[[1996\u20131997 school year]]===\nGiffard's portrait was moved to another landing of the [[Grand Staircase]], during the next school year. However, he still guarded a secret passage to the same place in the [[Middle Courtyard|Transfiguration Courtyard]]. Its password became \"''Light Against Darkness''\". He had a penchant for sighing wistfully, \"Oh, to be young again!\", when approached.<ref name=\"HBP\">{{HBP|G}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Giffard died prior to early [[1993]], as the portraits hung at [[Hogwarts Castle|Hogwarts]] depict deceased individuals.
