"Gordon Pummell was a student who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry between 1987 and 1989.By the 1993-1994 school year, he had been made a Prefect, and was tasked with patrolling areas of the school off limits to students.Gordon is derived from South Slavic word gord, which means \"dignified\". It could relate to him being a Prefect, who is highly respected.Pummel is probably from the English word pummel, which means \"to strike repeatedly\" or \"to criticise adversely\". It also has Latin roots that mean \"fruit, apple\".Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (PS2 version only)"
