"Terence Higgs (b. 1970s) was a wizard and a Slytherin student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.He was the Slytherin Quidditch team Seeker during the 19911992 season and in the first game of the year, raced Harry Potter for the Golden Snitch. Like Adrian Pucey, he appeared to be one of the more decent Slytherin players, as he seemed to play by the rules of Quidditch and did not resort to cheating. But in the 19921993 school year, he was replaced by Draco Malfoy. However, it is unknown if he was still attending Hogwarts at that time, or if he had already graduated.Flying: As the Seeker for the Slytherin Quidditch team, Higgs was evidently a talented broomstick flyer and Quidditch player, as he was deemed good enough to be Seeker for the team.Terence Higgs was portrayed by British actor Will Theakston, with the credits incorrectly stating he was played by Scot Fearn. Fearn's name was also misspelled as Fern.In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Terence Higgs used the cobbing foul against Harry Potter, although he could have done it simply in retaliation, since Harry cobbed him first. It is unclear if this was the case, as Terence ended up cobbing Harry four times as opposed to twice.Terentius was a Roman family name. It may mean \"tender\" or \"gracious\". Higgs is variation of Hicks, from old English Hicke, a nickname for the Norman French name Richard. The early English substituted an \"H\" because they had trouble saying the letter \"R\".Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (First appearance)Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)PottermoreWizarding WorldHarry Potter Trading Card GameLEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4Harry Potter for Kinect"
