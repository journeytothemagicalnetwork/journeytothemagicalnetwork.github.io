"Orsino Thruston (born 1976) was a wizard and the drummer for the popular band The Weird Sisters.On the 25 December 1994 (Christmas Day), Orsino with the rest of his band played at the Yule Ball at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the Great Hall, for the Triwizard Tournament celebrations that were being held at that time.Phil Selway portrayed Orsino in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.Orisno is an unlockable and playable character in LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, where he is unnamed but simply identified as \"Drummer\".Orsino attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1987 to 1994, the same years that Percy Weasley. In Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, he was attending Hogwarts in a timed side quest set in Year 2 (the 19851986 school year), causing an anachronism, as Orsino was only be around nine years old at the time. Similar issues have been present in other timed side quests as well, meaning it is possible the side quest actually takes place in a later year.The name \"Orsino\" is the Italian form of the Roman name Ursinus, itself derived from Ursus. This is the name of a character in Shakespeare's comedic play 'Twelfth Night' (1602).Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) (Appears on a Famous Wizard Card)Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) (Appears on a Famous Wizard Card)Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (unnamed)Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4 (Appears as \"Drummer\")Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery"
