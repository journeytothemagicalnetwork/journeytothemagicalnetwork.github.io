"Oliver Rivers (c. 1979-1980) was a wizard who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991. He was in the same year as Harry Potter and was Sorted into either Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw house.Oliver Rivers can be deduced to have been listed as a Ravenclaw on the list of students in a page of J. K. Rowling's notes shown on Harry Potter and Me. However, as two listed Hufflepuffs (Anthony Goldstein and Michael Corner) had their houses changed to Ravenclaw in the novels as published, two of those listed as Ravenclaws must have been changed to Hufflepuff. Rivers may be one of those whose house was changed.It is likely he was one of the students, whose house wasn't changed, so was a Ravenclaw and shared a dormitory with Terry Boot, Michael Corner and Anthony Goldstein, because his original surname was Quirrel and Quirinus Quirrell was a Ravenclaw.Harry Potter and Me (First mentioned)Pottermore (Mentioned only)Wizarding World (Mentioned only)"
