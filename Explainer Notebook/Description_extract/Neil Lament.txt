"Neil Lament was a Slytherin student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1940s. He was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team from 1944 to 1948.The name \"Neil\" is from the Gaelic name Niall, which is of disputed origin, possibly meaning \"champion\" or \"cloud\". This was the name of a semi-legendary 4th-century Irish king, Niall of the Nine Hostages.This character was presumably named in honour of Neil Lamont, the supervising art director for the first six Harry Potter films, from Philosopher's Stone to Half-Blood Prince.Based on the fact that he attended Hogwarts in the 1940s and being born around the 1930s, he was a few years below Tom Riddle during his time at Hogwarts.Harry Potter films (Name appears on plaque)"
