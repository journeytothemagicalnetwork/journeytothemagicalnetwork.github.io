"Peregrine Derrick (born c. 1977) was a British wizard who began attending Hogwarts in 1988.Sorted into Slytherin, Derrick played as a Beater on the Slytherin Quidditch team, along with Lucian Bole, in the 19931994 school year.Although there were no Quidditch matches at Hogwarts during the 19941995 school year because of the Triwizard Tournament, he held his position on the Slytherin team, at least nominally, until his graduation at the end of term. He and Bole were replaced by Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle at the start of the 19951996 school year. Angelina Johnson, the new captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, joked to her teammates that she was always shocked that Derrick and Bole were able to make it on to the Quidditch pitch without having to follow signs.Flying: Derrick was evidently an accomplished and talented broomstick flyer and Quidditch player, given how he was appointed as a Beater for the Slytherin Quidditch team.This character is known only by his surname in the Harry Potter books. His first name is given as \"Peregrine\" in the video game Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup.It is possible that Derrick is the Unidentified Slytherin Beater (II) seen in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and then played from the 19911992 school year.The name \"Peregrine\" is from the Late Latin name Peregrinus, which meant \"traveller\". This was the name of several early saints.Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) (Possible appearance)Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (First appearance)Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (Mentioned only)Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Mentioned only)Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup (First identified as Peregrine Derrick)"
