"McClaggan was a wizard who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1920s, having been Sorted into Gryffindor house. In September 1927, McClaggan was being taught by Professor Albus Dumbledore in Defence Against the Dark Arts, when the lesson was interrupted by Torquil Travers, the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and several accompanying Aurors. McClaggan tried to defend Dumbledore, much to Travers's irritation, before being ordered to follow Minerva McGonagall out of the classroom.McClaggan was portrayed by Alfie Simmons in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.Interestingly, even though the official spelling of the surname is given as \"McClaggan\" in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay, it is homophonous with \"McLaggen\", the surname of Cormac, a character in the original Harry Potter novels. This has made some speculate the two were meant to be relatives; in an Instagram Story on 3 January 2021, actor Alfie Simmons referred to the character he played in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald as \"the grandfather of a character from the originals\", but there has been no official confirmation of this.Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay (First appearance)Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"
