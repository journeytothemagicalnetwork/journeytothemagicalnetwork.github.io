"Mauricius (born c. 1980) was a wizard who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was friends with Vincent Crabbe and, in early 1995, took part in the Daily Prophet campaign to harass Rubeus Hagrid.This Hogwarts student was only mentioned on a Daily Prophet prop in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The text on the prop appears to be a copy of the \"DUMBLEDORE'S GIANT MISTAKE\" article featured in the novel (chapter twenty-four), however, in the prop Rubeus Hagrid's name is replaced by \"Eduardo\", \"he\" and \"him\", and Draco Malfoy's is replaced by \"Mauricius\".Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) (First mentioned)"
