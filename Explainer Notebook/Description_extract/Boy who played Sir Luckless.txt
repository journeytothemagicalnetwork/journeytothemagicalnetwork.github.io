"This boy attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the early part of the 20th century while Armando Dippet was headmaster. He was cast as Sir Luckless in the Christmas production of \"The Fountain of Fair Fortune\" that Herbert Beery, the Herbology Professor, arranged. An hour before the play started, he dumped the girl playing Amata in favour of the one playing Asha, causing the two jealous young witches to duel each other on the stage. Professor Beery was caught in the crossfire and unable to stop them or prevent the engorged ashwinder, serving as the gigantic white worm, from setting fire to the Great Hall.The Tales of Beedle the Bard (Mentioned only)"
