"Davey Gudgeon was a wizard and student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1970s.He got his face scarred and almost lost his eye trying to get close enough to the Whomping Willow to touch its trunk. For their own safety (and possibly the Willow's as well), students were forbidden to go near the tree since that event occurred.It is possible that Davey sustained other injuries, because it is never mentioned that Davey did lose an eyeball.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (First mentioned)"
