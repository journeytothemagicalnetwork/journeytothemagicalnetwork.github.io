"Ruth Mina was a witch and a Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s.Sometime in the 1990s, the library books she took out were overdue, and thus her name was included on a list of students with overdue books that was put up on the bulletin board in Gryffindor Tower by Madam Pince.This individual's name is most likely a combined reference to Ruth Winick, who worked as a graphic artist on Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets and as a draughtsman on Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire, and Miraphora Mina, another graphic artist who worked on every Harry Potter film.Harry Potter films (Mentioned on a poster)"
