"Justin Steele was a wizard and Ravenclaw student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s.In 1996, he stood at the entrance to Horace Slughorn's compartment on the Hogwarts Express, ensuring that only those who had received an invitation were allowed to enter. Later that same term, he, Daisy Corran, and Banga O'Deluga gave Harry Potter two Beater's bats in exchange for six Gobstones while in the Paved Courtyard.The name \"Justin\" comes from the Latin name Iustinus, which was derived from Justus. This was the name of several early saints including Justin Martyr, a Christian philosopher of 2nd century who was beheaded in Rome. It was also borne by two Byzantine emperors. As an English name, it has occasionally been used since the late Middle Ages, though it did not become common until the 20th century.This particular student was only featured in the console version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Nintendo DS version of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (First appearance) (Console version)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS and PSP version only)"
