"Merula Snyde's gang was founded by Merula Snyde in 1984 to assist her in seeking out clues to the location of the Cursed Vaults, as well as to possibly bully Muggle-borns and Blood traitors. This gang was overall very inefficient in carrying out its intended purpose.Merula Snyde (Founder/Leader)Barnaby Lee (formerly)Ismelda MurkJacob's sibling first encountered Merula Snyde's gang during the Wideye Potion lesson in the 19861987 school year at Hogwarts. Merula sarcastically welcomed back Jacob's sibling, while stating her new associates, Ismelda Murk and Barnaby Lee, would assist her in opening the remaining Cursed Vaults.After the class, they discussed what could possibly be in the next vaults, to which Merula rudely stated that it could be something that can bring back Jacob. Regardless of Jacob's sibling's reponse, Merula's gang left, with the exception of Barnaby, staying back to threaten Jacob's sibling with \"vanishing every bone\" in their body should they continue to interfere with Merula's plans. Jacob's sibling attempted to reason with Barnaby by pointing out that Merula was terrible to everyone around her and she was most likely lying to Barnaby in order to manipulate him. Barnaby pondered on Jacob's sibling statement for a moment, before rebuffing them and leaving the class.Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (First appearance)"
