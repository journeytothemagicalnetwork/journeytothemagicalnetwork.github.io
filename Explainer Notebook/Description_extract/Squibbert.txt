"Squibbert (b. 1976 or earlier) was a witch and student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.Sometime throughout her education, she changed a teapot into a ferret, albeit poorly, as its nose remained being a spout. A \"rather large\" Slytherin boy then chased after it with a butterfly net. A second year student witnessed this incident, and eventually wrote about it in a book after becoming an author. A copy of this book eventually found its way into the Hogwarts Library by the 1992-1993 school year.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) (First mentioned)"
