"Wendy Slinkhard was a British witch who wrote at least one book. While at Hogwarts, she studied under Horace Slughorn, and was selected to join the Slug Club. Slughorn kept a picture of the two, showing Wendy signing a copy of her book to Slughorn.Wendy may be related to Wilbert Slinkhard, the author of Defensive Magical Theory.Wendy appears only in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and is portrayed by Nina Aimer Fox.It is possible, as a former Slug Club member, she attended the Christmas party in 1996.In the case of the character from J. M. Barrie's play Peter Pan (1904), the name \"Wendy\" was created from the nickname fwendy \"friend\", given to the author by a young friend. However, the name was used prior to the play (rarely), in which case it could be related to the Welsh name Gwendolen and other names beginning with the element gwen meaning \"white, fair, blessed\".Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film) (Appears in photographs)"
