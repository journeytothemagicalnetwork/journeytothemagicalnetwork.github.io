"Emma Vanity was a witch and Slytherin student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1970s. She was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team from 1972 to 1976.The name \"Emma\" was originally a short form of Germanic names that began with the element ermen meaning \"whole\" or \"universal\". It was introduced to England by Emma of Normandy, who was the wife both of king Ethelred II (and by him the mother of Edward the Confessor) and later of king Canute. It was also borne by an 11th-century Austrian saint, who is sometimes called Hemma. After the Norman conquest this name became common in England. It was revived in the 18th century, perhaps in part due to Matthew Prior's poem Henry and Emma (1709). It was also used by Jane Austen for the central character, the matchmaker Emma Woodhouse, in her novel Emma (1816).This character is mentioned only on a prop plaque that was featured in at least one Harry Potter film. Her name is presumably a tribute to Emma Vane, who worked as a draughtsman on every film up until Half-Blood Prince, with the exception Chamber of Secrets.Harry Potter films (Name appears on plaque)"
