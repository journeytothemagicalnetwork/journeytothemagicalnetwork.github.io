He traded many things ([[Chocolate Frog Card]]s, chess pieces, and [[Butterbeer]]) for [[Gobstones]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"David\" comes from the Hebrew name \u05d3\u05b8\u05bc\u05d5\u05b4\u05d3 (Dawid), which was probably derived from Hebrew \u05d3\u05d5\u05d3 (dwd) meaning \"beloved\". King David was the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel according to the Hebrew Bible.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*This particular student was only featured in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|PlayStation 2 version]] of {{POA}} and the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|Nintendo DS version]] of {{HBP}}.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{PS2 only}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Nolton, David}}\n[[pl:David Nolton]]\n[[fr:David Nolton]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
