[[30 October]], [[2020]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the late [[2010s]] and early [[2020s]].\n\n==Biography==\nCraig Bowker Junior was born somewhere in the [[Great Britain|United Kingdom]] or [[Ireland]] in the mid-[[2000s]]. He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was sorted in [[Slytherin]].<ref name=\"act1scene4\">{{CC|B|1|4}}</ref><ref name=\"act3scene15\">{{CC|B|3|15}}</ref> On [[1 September]] [[2017]], he was present for the year's [[sorting ceremony]], and expressed his disbelief when [[Albus Potter]] was placed in his house.<ref name=\"act1scene4\" />\n\nUpon returning to [[2020]] from altering the past, [[Scorpius Malfoy]] found himself in an alternate reality in which [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] won, and went to the [[Hogwarts Library]] to research how this could have happened.<ref name=\"act3scene4\">{{CC|B|3|4}}</ref> That universe's Craig encountered Scorpius in the library and, frightened, asked him what he was doing there. He then revealed that he was still working on the homework that his universe's Scorpius had demanded he do for him.<ref name=\"act3scene4\" />\n\nMeanwhile, in the main timeline, [[Harry Potter]] arrived at Hogwarts with [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] to confront his son Albus about his continuing association with Scorpius, and upon entering the [[Slytherin Dungeon|Slytherin dormitories]] Craig objected, noting that it was against school rules for parents and professors to enter house dormitories, but [[Minerva McGonagall|Headmistress McGonagall]] shushed him. They found the boys' beds empty.<ref name=\"act3scene15\" />\n\nA short time later, Craig located Albus and Scorpius on the [[Hogwarts Quidditch pitch|Quidditch pitch]] and informed them that the entire school was looking for them. [[Delphini|Delphi]] then fired a [[Killing Curse]] at him, killing him instantly.<ref name=\"act3scene19\">{{CC|B|3|19}}</ref>\n\n[[Delphini]] was presumably later sent to [[Azkaban]] for this crime.<ref name=\"act4scene11\">{{CC|B|4|11}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Jeremy-Ang-Jones-.jpg|thumb|Jeremy Ang Jones]]\n*In {{CC|P1}}, Craig was played by [[Jeremy Ang Jones]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{CC}} {{1st}}\n*{{CC|P}}\n*{{WW}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Bowker, Craig Junior}}\n\n[[de:Craig Bowker jr.]]\n[[fr:Craig Bowker Jr]]\n[[es:Craig Bowker Jr]]\n[[pl:Craig Bowker Jr]]\n[[ru:\u041a\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0433 \u0411\u043e\u0443\u043a\u0435\u0440 (\u043c\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0448\u0438\u0439)]]\n[[Category:2000s births]]\n[[Category:2020 deaths]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Deaths by Killing Curse]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Murder victims]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
