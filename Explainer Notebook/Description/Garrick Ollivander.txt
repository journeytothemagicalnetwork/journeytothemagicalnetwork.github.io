[[25 September]],<ref name=\"pottermore\" /> pre-[[1909]]<ref name=\"yearage\" />) was a [[half-blood]]<ref name=\"pottermore\" /> [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was the proprietor of [[Ollivanders]] in [[Diagon Alley]] during most of the [[20th century]]. Ollivander was widely considered the best [[wandmaker]] in the world, and many [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] bought their [[wand]]s from him.\n\nIn [[1996]], Ollivander was captured and [[Cruciatus Curse|tortured]] by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. He was rescued in [[1998]] by [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Dobby]]. He imparted important information regarding [[wandlore]] to Harry, it helped him in his understanding of the [[Deathly Hallows]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nGarrick Ollivander was born to [[Gervaise Ollivander]],<ref name=\"wandwoods\">{{WW|wand-woods}}</ref> a wizard, and his [[Garrick Ollivander's mother|wife]], a [[Muggle-born]] witch,<ref name=\"pottermore\" /> on the [[25 September]],<ref name=\"pottermore\" /> in or before the year [[1909]].<ref name=\"yearage\" />\n\nThe [[Ollivander family]] had long been associated with the profession of [[Wandlore|wandcraft]]. The surname means 'he who owns the olive wand' which is of [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] origin, suggesting that the family emigrated to Britain from elsewhere, probably arriving in Britain with the Romans and set up a shop, to sell wands that were superior to the unreliable, poorly constructed ones fashioned by British wizards at the time.<ref name=\"pm\" />\n\nGarrick Ollivander attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in his youth, where he was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw|Ravenclaw House]].<ref name=\"pottermore\" />\n\n===Career as a wandmaker===\n{{Quote|Renowned wandmaker Mr Ollivander owns the wand shop Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands Since 382 BC in Diagon Alley.

Soon, he developed an ambition to improve upon the cores and wand woods he made and developed a determination to pursue the ideal wand.<ref name=\"pottermore\" />\n\nBefore Garrick Ollivander's proprietorship of [[Ollivanders]], wizards used a wide variety of wand cores; the customer would often present their [[wandmaker]] with a magical substance to which they were attached, and he would turn it into their wand core.<ref name=\"pottermore\" /> Mr Ollivander believed that doing so altered the wand's temperament,<ref name=\"GOF18\">{{GOF|B|18}}</ref> and he revolutionised the way [[wand]]s were crafted by having cores of immensely powerful magical substances expertly enclosed in specially selected and complementary [[Wand wood|wandwoods]], with the result being that the wand would be matched to an owner that the wand itself felt an affinity for.<ref name=\"pottermore\" />\n\n[[File:Sorcerers-stone-ollivander.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Ollivander talking with a customer]]\nWhile there was initially substantial resistance to this new way wands were made, it soon became clear that wands made by Ollivander were far superior to any others. His methods of locating wand woods and core substances, marrying them together, and matching them to ideal owners were all jealously guarded secrets that were coveted by rival wandmakers.<ref name=\"pottermore\" />\n\nAs with other wandmakers, Ollivander made it his business to study the mystifying [[Elder Wand]] in depth, such as its history and distinctive characteristics. Unlike [[Hermione Granger]], he believed that the Elder Wand was not a myth or tale, and showed great enthusiasm with the powerful object despite the fact that it was dangerous and has had a bloody history. When held captive by Lord Voldemort, he was forced to relate all information he had known about the powerful wand. He also revealed that the last person rumoured to own the wand was [[Mykew Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]], a foreign wandmaker, though he did not believe the rumour and thought that Gregorovitch spread it to boost his business.<ref name=\"DH24\" />\n\nSometime into his career, in the summer of [[1938]], Ollivander sold [[Tom Riddle]] his [[Tom Riddle's wand|wand]].<ref name=\"PS5\">{{PS|B|5}}</ref>\n\n====1984\u20131985 school year====\nShortly before the [[1984\u20131985 school year]], Ollivander sold a [[Jacob's sibling's first wand|wand]] to [[Jacob's sibling]], just as he did with [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] before them.<ref>{{HM|1|1}}</ref>\n\n====1988\u20131989 school year====\nDuring the [[1988\u20131989 school year]], [[Mundungus Fletcher]] visited Ollivander and asked about the wand of [[Wizard in white robes|an opponent]] whom he had lost a duel to. Ollivander couldn't tell much because of the lack of the real wand, and advised him to go see [[Villanelle|Madam Villanelle]] for his questions of the way his opponent had shouted incantations.

He was originally set to appear in the {{GOF|FA}},<ref>[http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/hurt-to-return-as-ollivander-in-goblet-of-fire-13201/ Snitchseeker.com: Hurt to return as Ollivander in Goblet of Fire]</ref> but the character's scenes were cut from the final film and have not been released.\n*Ollivander is one of the only people before {{PS}} who knew Voldemort's real name. He said in the first book he knows that Voldemort's wand caused Harry's scar. While this is not stated in any explicit way, the very fact that Voldemort has only ever had one wand (except for his use of the wand of [[Lucius Malfoy]] and the [[Elder Wand]] very late in life) would ensure that Ollivander would have sold him a wand at age 11, when he still used his former name. It is possible that he somehow deduced the secret sometime before July 1991, be it through mere deduction or that Dumbledore himself told him, since Dumbledore did say that Ollivander contacted him to tell him that Harry had bought the only other wand in existence crafted with one of Fawkes's feathers. He might simply have recognised the wand in the hands of Lord Voldemort.\n*Ollivander's first name, Garrick, was revealed via his shop in {{PM}}.\n*In {{DH}}, Ollivander has no knowledge of the term \"Deathly Hallows\", being only aware of the Elder Wand, but not of its status as one of these fabled objects. In the film adaptation, {{DH|F2}}, however, he is fully aware of the legend and even provides some information about it not provided by [[Xenophilius Lovegood]]. He denies the tale having any truth, however, until Harry forces him to admit that he told Voldemort about the Elder Wand.\n*Originally published on {{PM}} and later transferred to {{WW}}, there is a feature called \"5 things we learned from wise Mr Ollivander\" that highlights facts about wandlore.<ref>''[https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/5-things-we-learned-from-wise-mr-ollivander 5 things we learned from wise Mr Ollivander]'' at {{WW}}</ref>\n*In {{HBP|FA}}, Ollivander being kidnapped by Death Eaters at the start of the film is shown (as opposed to just being mentioned in the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|novel]]), with his face being obscured with a sack.\n*[[James Howard]], the actor who was first a part of the Ensemble and eventually portrayed [[Draco Malfoy]] in {{CC|P1}}, also portrayed Garrick Ollivander, voicing him when the [[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child cast lists|cast]] of {{CC}} read aloud {{PS|B|5}} together, organised by [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] for the [[2021]] [[Harry Potter Book Night]].<ref>(see [[:File:Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Reading|this video]]) {{c|video currently set to private}}</ref><ref name=\"CC cast\">[https://twitter.com/BloomsburyBooks/status/1357342410527809536 #HarryPotterBookNight has moved to 24th June (although if you have an event planned today then go for it, and have fun!).
