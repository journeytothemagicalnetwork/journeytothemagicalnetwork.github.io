One of Dirk's most notable traits was his fluency in [[Gobbledegook]]. After graduating, he went to work at the Ministry and eventually became Head of the Goblin Liaison Office. Many of his colleagues considered him a great wizard. \n\nWhen the Ministry was taken over by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], Dirk attempted to use a forged family tree in order to claim wizarding heritage, but was discovered by [[Albert Runcorn]].

[[Albus Dumbledore]] also suggested that Slughorn's friendliness with Cresswell resulted in Cresswell requesting him to make suggestions for possible junior members within the Goblin Liaison Office.<ref name=\"HBP4\" />\n\n====Muggle-Born Registration Commission====\n{{Quote|As your new Minister for Magic, I promise to restore this temple of tolerance to its former glory.

Shortly after, it began persecuting [[Muggle-born]] wizards and witches, beginning with the formation of the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]] and the Snatchers organisations, in accordance with the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] ideology. Muggle-borns were accused of having stolen [[magic]] and sentenced to [[Azkaban]] for it.<ref name=\"DH11\">{{DH|B|11}}</ref><ref name=\"DH13\" />\n\n[[File:SnatchersMinistry.jpg|240x240px|thumb|left|[[Snatchers]] drag a battered Dirk Cresswell across the Ministry Atrium]]\n\nCresswell arranged with a wizard to forge a false family tree so that the Ministry would believe that he was of a different [[blood status]].

The group proceeded to stay on the move along the countryside.<ref name=\"DH15\" />\n\nOne night, in the autumn of 1997, they set camp on a riverbank in [[Wales]], where they could summon some salmon to eat. Unbeknownst to any of them, [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] were sitting in a tent concealed from sight by a number of protective enchantments. The group started talking. Dirk told them of his escape. The subject of conversation turned into war and [[Harry Potter]]. Dirk told the group he had doubts [[Severus Snape]] had really killed [[Albus Dumbledore]], as the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', which he had been reading, made such a strong case against Harry. Tonks told Cresswell to start reading ''[[The Quibbler]]'', an independent publication not under the control of the Ministry, to know the facts. Cresswell exploded into laughter, swallowing a fish bone and expressing scorn at what he called \"''that lunatic rag of [[Xenophilius Lovegood|Xeno Lovegood]]'s''\". They told Cresswell ''The Quibbler'' was not so lunatic any more, and Dean voiced his trust in Harry.<ref name=\"DH15\" />\n\nThe conversation soon enough turned into a discussion of whether they should sleep there or back up a wooded slope whence they came.

He was able to instantly understand [[Griphook]]s use of the language whilst in hiding with him.<ref name=\"DH15\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Dirk\" is the short form of ''Diederik''. The name was popularised in the English-speaking world by actor Dirk Bogarde (1921-1999), who had some Dutch ancestry. This is also the Scots word for a type of dagger.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Dirk Cresswell is played in {{DH|F1}} by an unknown actor. The part is listed by IMDb as being played (uncredited) by [[Ricky Wilson]], lead singer of the [[wikipedia:Kaiser Chiefs|Kaiser Chiefs]].
