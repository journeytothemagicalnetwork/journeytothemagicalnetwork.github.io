Saint Basil the Great was a 4th-century bishop of Caesarea and one of the fathers of the early Christian church. It was also borne by two Byzantine emperors.\n\n\"Fronsac\" is a French surname denoting a person who came from the town of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fronsac,_Gironde Fronsac], which dates back to Gaulish times.
