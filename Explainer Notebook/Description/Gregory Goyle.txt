First time they've ever been top in anything, I expect.|[[Neville Longbottom]] describing Crabbe and Goyle's cruelty|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\n\n'''Gregory Goyle''' (b. [[1979]]/[[1980]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] in the same year as [[Harry Potter]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. Goyle was the son of [[Gregory Goyle's father|a Death Eater]] and [[Gregory Goyle's mother|his wife]]. It is unknown if he was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] as well.\n\nGoyle, along with fellow Slytherin [[Vincent Crabbe]], seemed to already be best friends with [[Draco Malfoy]] before their first year at Hogwarts. Both wizards were shown to be more lackeys than friends, often following Malfoy around and doing his bidding.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life {{C|1980-1991}}===\nGregory Goyle was born into a [[pure-blood]] magical family in late 1979 or early 1980. His father, [[Gregory Goyle's father|Mr Goyle]], was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] during the [[First Wizarding War]] and a loyal supporter of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] until his downfall in 1981. Several Death Eaters avoided imprisonment in [[Azkaban]] by claiming that the Dark Lord had controlled them with the [[Imperius Curse]]. It is likely that Mr Goyle did this.\n\nDue to all of their fathers being Death Eaters, Goyle probably knew [[Draco Malfoy]] and [[Vincent Crabbe]] before his first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Like many new students, he might have purchased his wand from [[Ollivanders]] in [[Diagon Alley]].\n\n===Hogwarts years {{C|1991-1998}}===\n====First year====\n{{Quote|They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he passed, too.|Harry Potter regarding Goyle's stupidity and [[first year exams]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}Goyle started his education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]]. He, Draco, and Crabbe met [[Harry Potter]] and offered him acceptance into their clan. Harry rejected this offer and left Draco Malfoy, the leader of the group, confused as to why he would choose to be friends with [[Ronald Weasley]] instead. After being rejected, Goyle attempted to steal some of Harry and Ron's treats from the food trolley and he ended up getting bitten by Ron's pet rat, [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]].<ref name=\"PS\">{{PS}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The_Trio_(Crabbe,_Malfoy_and_Goyle)_1991b.JPG|250px|thumb|left|[[Vincent Crabbe]], [[Draco Malfoy]], and Gregory Goyle in their first Potions class]]\n\nWhen he arrived at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], he was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into the House of [[Slytherin]] with his friends Draco Malfoy and Vincent Crabbe. Throughout the year, Goyle was mean to Harry Potter and Ron Weasley and at the end of the year final exam results were to be given out and Harry Potter (who disliked Goyle) hoped that he was as stupid as he was mean and would fail his exams. However, Goyle just managed to scrape through them and passed his first year of education.<ref name=\"PS\"/>\n\n====Second year====\n{{Quote|Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry. Oh, you know what I mean \u2014 Goyle's Potion looked like bogies.|[[Hermione Granger]] speaking about Goyle's polyjuice potion|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}In his [[second year]] of education, the [[Chamber of Secrets]] was opened for the second time, having opened 50 years previously when [[Tom Riddle]] was in education. There was suspicion amongst the students as to who the Chamber was referring to when messages regarding an \"Heir of Slytherin\" were written on walls in blood. Some speculated that it was [[Harry Potter]], others [[Draco Malfoy]].<ref name=\"COS\">{{COS}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Crabbe & Goyle Drugged.gif|250px|thumb|Crabbe and Goyle eating the cakes containing [[Sleeping Draught]]]]\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione wanted to get more information and decided to brew [[Polyjuice Potion]] so that they could take the forms of Goyle, Crabbe, and [[Millicent Bulstrode]] and question Draco. When attempting to steal items from [[Severus Snape]]'s store room for the Polyjuice Potion, Hermione Granger needed a distraction and Harry threw a firecracker into Goyle's [[Swelling Solution]].<ref name=\"COS\"/>\n\nOver the [[Christmas holidays]], the Polyjuice potion was finally completed and the three needed to get some of their designated pupils' DNA in order to make a transformation. Hermione had already gotten hairs from Millicent Bulstrode's robes during a violent [[Duelling Club]] practise; however she did not know that these hairs belonged to her cat. Harry and Ron still needed to get some hairs of Crabbe and Goyle and put Sleeping Draught into some [[Chocolate cake|cakes]] that Goyle and Crabbe would later eat and fall asleep. Once they fell asleep Ron and Harry managed to acquire their hair, Goyle's hair turned the polyjuice potion a khaki colour when it was added.<ref name=\"COS\"/>\n\n====Third year====\n{{Quote|An unworthy trick!

However, they could not act on their wishes as new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor [[Remus Lupin]] was in the compartment sleeping and they left. Early in the school year it was quite clear that the [[Dementor]]s guarding Hogwarts from [[Sirius Black]] were feared by Harry and during a [[Quidditch]] match, Goyle and his friends put their cloaks up and pretended to be [[Dementor]]s in an attempt to scare Harry, which it did and Harry cast a corporal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] charm in response. This plot led Goyle and his friends to be caught by an angry McGonagall, who gave them all detention.<ref name=\"POA\">{{POA}}</ref>\n\nGoyle was later humiliated when Harry (under his invisibility cloak) defended his friends [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] by throwing snowballs at him and pulling down his trousers.

After [[Harry Potter]] became a champion alongside [[Cedric Diggory]], Goyle, Crabbe, and Malfoy passed out [[Potter Stinks badge|badges]] that could be made to read \"''Potter Stinks''\" and taunting Harry regularly, such as commenting that he was betting Harry wouldn't last more than a few minutes with the dragons. When provoked, Harry and Malfoy duelled, and Harry's [[Pimple Jinx]] meant for Malfoy rebounded and struck Goyle in the face. [[Severus Snape]] sent Goyle to the [[Hospital Wing]], but ignored the collateral damage to [[Hermione Granger]] from Malfoy's rebounding hex, [[Densaugeo]].<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n\nAt the end of the year, Harry was almost murdered by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], and saw that [[Gregory Goyle's father|Goyle's father]] was a Death Eater.<ref name=\"GOF\">{{GOF}}</ref>\n\n====Fifth year====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a-c|Angelina Johnson|It looks as though Montague\u2019s replaced them with the usual gorillas, rather than anyone who can fly particularly well.

Goyle was transformed into a [[Unidentified little girl|little girl]] who held a pair of scales, which he was to drop noisily any time someone went past. During one of his watches, Harry frightened off Goyle, and waited unsuccessfully for Malfoy to exit.

For the first time, Goyle was able to excel at some of his school-work, as [[Neville Longbottom]] noted that he and Crabbe were proficient in the [[Dark Arts (class)|Dark Arts]] class taught by [[Amycus Carrow]],  which involved the torturing of disobedient [[first year]]s with the [[Cruciatus Curse]].<ref name=\"DH\">{{DH}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Goyle, Crabbe, and Malfoy did not flee with the other [[Slytherin]]s; instead, they tried to ambush [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] in the Room of Requirement. In the ensuing fight, Goyle was less aggressive than Crabbe, who defied Draco's orders and tried multiple dark curses. Goyle was [[Disarming Charm|disarmed]] by Harry and then [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] by Hermione. When Crabbe's [[Fiendfyre|cursed fire]] got out of control, Goyle was saved by Ron and Hermione, who flew him out on their broom while Harry saved Draco. Crabbe was engulfed by the flames and killed.

If he did survive, his friendship with Draco apparently ended sometime after they completed school.

It is also associated with the {{w|Grigori}}, \"the Watchers\", a group of fallen angels who mated with mortal women to spawn a race of giants. This may allude to Goyle frequently acting like a bodyguard to Draco Malfoy and to his large frame.\n*His last name is probably from \"gargoyle,\" small monsters used to decorate buildings. The Gargouille also was a legendary water monster living in the River Seine in Paris, France. Gargoyles served as gutters/downspouts on gothic buildings. The word Gargoyle is derived from the French gargouille and the Latin ''gargula'' which translate to ''throat ''in contemporary English. Related words include gargle and gurgle.\n*Interestingly, gargoyles' supposed jobs are to watch over the building they are perched on. They are portrayed as grim and monstrous characters.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:GoyleLEGOminifigure.png|thumb|130px|Gregory Goyle as a LEGO mini-figure]]\n*Goyle is portrayed by [[Josh Herdman]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptions]] of [[Harry Potter books|''Harry Potter'']], making him one of fourteen characters to appear in all eight.\n*In the books, Goyle is generally portrayed as being less intelligent than Crabbe, but in the films it seems to be the other way around.\n*In the {{POA|FA}}, Goyle was absent during the scene at Hogsmeade, being replaced by the original character [[Pike]]. This was due to Josh Herdman being incapable of performing such a scene due to a then-recent injury.\n*Goyle is among the cast of characters who appear in all eight films, though he hardly has any lines at all.\n[[File:Goyle_Falls_to_his_Death.jpg|250px|thumb|Goyle falls to his death in ''Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2'']]\n*In {{DH|F2}}, Goyle takes the place of Crabbe, who was written out due to drug charges against [[Jamie Waylett]]. Goyle dies in Crabbe's place; when Goyle (mirroring Crabbe in the book) tries to kill Hermione with the Killing Curse, Ron chases after him, and Goyle casts Fiendfyre in an attempt to kill him, after which (Goyle) attempts to climb to safety with Malfoy and [[Blaise Zabini]] (who plays roughly the same role as Goyle does in the book), but grabs onto a loose chair and falls into the fire. Also, at the beginning of the scene, when Harry asks Malfoy to turn back from Voldemort, Goyle insists that he stay on Voldemort's side. In addition, it is not Goyle who destroys the diadem, but Harry, who stabs it with a Basilisk Fang before Ron kicks it into the fire.<ref>[http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/jamie-waylett-won-t-return-deathly-hallows-66514 SnitchSeeker.com]</ref>\n[[File:GoyleLEGOHP1-4.png|thumb|150px|Gregory Goyle in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]\n*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, Goyle is portrayed as being more intelligent (and even supportive of Harry at times); when Malfoy and Crabbe confront Harry after [[Mrs Norris]] gets petrified, Goyle is disapproving of their behaviour, and at the end of the same school year, he cheers for Harry until Malfoy knocks him out. Something similar happens in {{COS|FA}}, where Malfoy simply pulls [[Vincent Crabbe]] back down when about to cheer for Hagrid.\n*In {{LEGO|Y2}}, unlike the film, Goyle doesn't grab onto a loose chair and climbs to safety successfully like Draco and Blaise. However, when Harry and Ron rescue Draco and Blaise, Hermione is unable to reach Goyle, who remains standing on the high ground until the Fiendfyre charges at him, killing Goyle offscreen. Contrary to canon, Goyle's in-game character is unable to perform [[Dark Arts|dark magic]]. \n*Gregory Goyle's LEGO minifigure in set 4735 features Harry Potter's face on the flip side to show that it is actually Harry, disguised by Polyjuice Potion.<ref name=\"lhpcharacters\">{{LEGO|C}}, Page 52 (\"Gregory Goyle: Slytherin Infiltrator\")</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Gregory Goyle}}\n*{{PS}} {{1st}}\n*{{PS|F}}\n*{{PS|G}}\n*{{COS}}\n*{{COS|F}}\n*{{COS|G}}\n*{{POA}}\n*{{POA|F}}\n*{{POA|G}}\n*{{GOF}}\n*{{GOF|F}}\n*{{OOTP}}\n*{{OOTP|F}}\n*{{OOTP|G}}\n*{{HBP}}\n*{{HBP|F}}\n*{{HBP|G}}\n*{{DH}}\n*{{DH|F1}}\n*{{DH|F2}}\n*{{DH|G2}}\n*{{CC}} {{Mention}}\n*{{CC|P}} {{Mention}}\n*{{PM}}\n*{{WW}}\n*{{QWC}}\n*{{LEGO|C}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}}\n*{{LEGO}}\n*{{HPV|CH}}\n*{{TCG}}\n*{{MA}} {{Mention}}\n*{{WU}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Draco's gang}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n{{Death Eaters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Goyle, Gregory}}\n\n[[de:Gregory Goyle]]\n[[es:Gregory Goyle]]\n[[fr:Gregory Goyle]]\n[[it:Gregory Goyle]]\n[[no:Grylius Gurgel]]\n[[ru:\u0413\u0440\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u0413\u043e\u0439\u043b]]\n[[fi:Gregory Goyle]]\n[[nl:Karel Kwast]]\n[[pl:Gregory Goyle]]\n[[ja:\u30b0\u30ec\u30b4\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30b4\u30a4\u30eb]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:Beaters]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Dark wizards]]\n[[Category:Death Eater allies]]\n[[Category:Foundables]]\n[[Category:Goyle family]]\n[[Category:Impersonated individuals]]\n[[Category:Inquisitorial Squad]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pure-bloods]]\n[[Category:Skirmish at the Room of Requirement participants]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Slytherins Sorted in 1991]]\n[[Category:Unforgivable curse users]]"
