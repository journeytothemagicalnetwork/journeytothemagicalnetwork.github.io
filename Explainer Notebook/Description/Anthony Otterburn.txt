When their relationship turned sour, he and his mistress Cleopatra were attacked and forced to commit suicide, as related in Shakespeare's tragedy 'Antony and Cleopatra' (1606).\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{1st}} {{C|Console versions}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Duelling Club}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Otterburn, Anthony}}\n[[es:Anthony Otterburn]]\n[[pl:Anthony Otterburn]]\n[[fr:Anthony Otterburn]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Duelling Club members]]\n[[Category:Hufflepuffs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
