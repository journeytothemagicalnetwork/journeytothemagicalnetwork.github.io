He possibly took it from Greek \u039d\u03b7\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 (''Nereis'') meaning \"nymph, sea sprite\", ultimately derived from the name of the Greek sea god ''Nereus'', who supposedly fathered them.\n*The word \"brody\" is slang for intentionally spinning in circles and sliding in an automobile.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{PS2 only}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogwarts Exploding Snap}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brody, Nerissa}}\n[[pl:Nerissa Brody]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Exploding Snap players]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
