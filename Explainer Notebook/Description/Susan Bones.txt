[[1979]]/[[1980]]) was a [[half-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]]<ref name=\"HPM\" /> and a [[Hufflepuff]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1991]]-[[1998]].<ref name=\"OP16\" /> She was a member of the prominent [[Bones family]], a family with strong connections to the [[Ministry of Magic]].\n\nSusan's entire [[Bones family|family]], including her grandparents, [[Edgar Bones|uncle]], [[Edgar Bones's wife|aunt]], and [[Edgar Bones's children|cousins]] were all murdered personally by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] during the [[First Wizarding War]],<ref name=\"OP25\">{{OOTP|B|25}}</ref> and her other aunt [[Amelia Bones]] was [[Killing Curse|murdered]] by Voldemort in [[July]] of [[1996]].<ref name=\"HBP1\">{{HBP|B|1}}</ref> In her fifth year, Susan became a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation taught and led by [[Harry Potter]].<ref name=\"OP16\" /> Susan fought along side her fellow D.A. members in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].\n\nIt can be assumed that Susan survived the [[Second Wizarding War]], as her name was not listed amongst the casualties of the fallen deceased. What happened to Susan afterwards is unknown.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nLittle is known about Susan's early life, other than the fact that she was born to at least one wizard parent, and presumably named after her aunt [[Amelia Bones|Amelia]]'s middle name. Susan came from a largely magical family background, and also a rather powerful and respected family.\n\nDue to her family's position, they were sought after during the [[First Wizarding War]] by [[Death Eaters]] and a large majority were killed. Susan was born in or around [[1980]], a year before the war ended.\n\nDuring the [[1990\u20131991 school year]], the year before Susan started at Hogwarts, her aunt Amelia had her [[Amelia Bones's assistant|personal assistant]] at the Ministry sent to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] with [[Spattergroit]]; since she was assigned a [[Jacob's sibling|seventh-year Hogwarts student]] in the [[Ministry of Magic student programme|Ministry student programme]] to replace the assistant, she found it easier to spend more time with her niece.<ref name=\"HM77Assist\">{{HM|7|7|Assist Madam Bones}}</ref>\n\n===Hogwarts years {{C|1991-1998}}===\n====First year====\n{{Dialogue a-b|Minerva McGonagall|Bones, Susan.|Sorting Hat| ''HUFFLEPUFF''!|Susan Bones being sorted|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}\n[[File:Susanboat.PNG|thumb|left|Susan in the [[Hogwarts boats|boat]] with [[Seamus Finnigan]] and [[Hermione Granger]]]]\n\nSusan Bones started her education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]] the same year as the famous [[Harry Potter]]. Susan shared a [[Hogwarts boats|boat]] with [[Seamus Finnigan]] and [[Hermione Granger]].<ref name=\"PSF\">{{PS|F}}</ref> She was the third student to be called upon by [[Minerva McGonagall]] for the [[Sorting ceremony]] and was Sorted into [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]]<ref name=\"PS7\">{{PS|B|7}}</ref> the Head of Hufflepuff House at the time was [[Pomona Sprout]], the [[Herbology]] [[Professor]]. She was sorted into this house along with [[Hannah Abbott]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], [[Wayne Hopkins]], [[Megan Jones]], and [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]] all of whom she presumably became friends with. It is also assumed that Hufflepuff house is the house that many of her relatives were Sorted into as well.\n\n[[File:Susan Sorting.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Susan being Sorted into Hufflepuff House]]\nDuring her first year, Susan would learn all about the basics of [[magic]] and [[spell]] performance, like her other classmates. She was also present at the [[End-of-Term Feast]] during which Gryffindor won the [[House Cup]] breaking Slytherin's seven year winning streak.\n\n====Second year====\n{{Quote|Hannah, he's a [[Parseltongue|Parselmouth]]. Everyone knows that's the mark of a dark wizard. Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes? They called [[Salazar Slytherin|Slytherin]] himself ''Serpent-tongue''.|Ernie Macmillan shares his opinion of Harry with the Hufflepuffs|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\n\n[[File:Duelling Club 1992.jpg|250px|thumb|Susan with fellow students during the first and last meeting of the Duelling Club]]\n\nDuring her second year, Susan seemed to develop a crush on then-[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] Professor [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], which caused her to be off-task daydreaming during his lessons. She participated in the [[Duelling Club]], as a precaution due to the Basilisk attacks that occurred after the [[Chamber of Secrets]] had been opened. During the meeting, Susan's friend [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]] was almost attacked by a serpent, which was acting under the orders of [[Harry Potter]] via the use of his Parseltongue ability. Many assumbed that Harry was egging the snake on, but in reality he was the only thing that kept the snake from attacking Justin.<ref name=\"COSF\">{{COS|F}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hermiona i susan.png|250x250px|thumb|left|Susan in her second year Herbology class with [[Hermione Granger]]]]\n\nSusan seemed to get along well with Hermione Granger, a [[Gryffindor]], and the two shared an interest in the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart and the two would be usually seated together in their Defence Against the Dark Arts classes, both listening intently on Lockhart's every word. She and Hermione seemed to become quite good friends this year and [[Herbology]] both worked next to one another when potting [[Mandrake]]s, and it must have come as a shock when later on in the year Hermione was petrified by the [[Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk|Basilisk]] that resided in the [[Chamber of Secrets]].<ref name=\"COSF\"/>\n\nLater in the year, Lockhart was shown to be a fraud. Presumably, after knowing all the truth about Lockhart in the end of the school year, she lost her interest in him as he no longer was a great wizard who had done heroic deeds and performed extraordinary magic. When Hagrid returned to Hogwarts, Susan applauded him along with a majority of the school as they celebrated the close of a terrifying year.<ref name=\"COSF\"/>\n\n====Third year====\nDuring her [[1993-1994 school year|third year]], she would have to select what subjects she wished to take. The school would also be in believed danger from Azkaban escapee, [[Sirius Black]], who was suspected to be looking for Harry Potter.\n\n====Fourth year====\nDuring Susan's [[1994\u20131995 school year|fourth year]] Hogwarts held the [[Triwizard Tournament]] and Hufflepuff's [[Cedric Diggory]] was one of the Triwizard champions. It is likely that Susan Bones supported Cedric Diggory in favour of Harry Potter, as he was in her house and both her best friends [[Hannah Abbott]] and [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]] were strong supporters of Diggory.\n\n[[File:Students at memorial.jpg|250x250px|thumb|The memorial feast of Cedric Diggory that Susan attended]]\n\nCedric Diggory was technically the joint-winner with Harry Potter after he and Harry both reached the [[Triwizard Cup]], thus making them the champions. Sadly Diggory lost his life to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] after being [[Portkey|taken]] to [[Little Hangleton]] and the [[Second Wizarding War]] began. The students were horrified to learn of Cedric's death, mainly students of [[Hufflepuff]], who were closest to him, but the relationship of Susan with Cedric is unknown. It is more than likely that Susan attended the [[Memorial feast to Cedric Diggory]] at the end of the school year.\n\n====Fifth year====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Susan|My [[Amelia Bones|aunt]] says you can produce a fully corporeal Patronus, is that true?|Harry Potter|Er \u2014 you don't know Madam Bones, do you?|She's my auntie. I'm Susan Bones.|Susan Bones asking Harry about his Patronus|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)}}\n\nIn [[1995]], Hogwarts was to be under the watchful eye of the Minister and his personally appointed [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher [[Dolores Umbridge]]. Umbridge worked with Susan's aunt in the Ministry, and both served on the court for Harry Potter's trial. When Umbridge came to Hogwarts, she ensured that no practical defensive spells would be taught in her lessons, despite the claims that Lord Voldemort had returned. Thus she did not teach anything worth learning.\n\n[[File:SusanBonesDA.PNG|240x240px|thumb|left|Susan in the [[Room of Requirement]] after a D.A. meeting]]\n\nWith the students looking for a teacher, and Harry with the best knowledge of defensive and offensive spells, Hermione Granger pledged the idea of forming an alliance to learn spells and rebel against Umbridge. This would be called [[Dumbledore's Army]], which Susan would become a member of. During the first meeting, Susan was curious to know whether Harry could produce a corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], a fact which she had been told by her aunt; when Harry asked if she knew Madam Bones, Susan confirmed the familial relationship.<ref name=\"OP16\"/>\n\nHarry later gave lessons on Patronuses, but it is unknown whether Susan produced one or what form it took. Later on in the year, the [[Death Eaters]] who murdered her uncle [[Edgar Bones|Edgar]] and his family escaped from [[Azkaban]], the wizarding prison, and many students questioned Susan for information about this. After the Death Eaters' escape, Susan told Harry that she understood how he felt, knowing that the person who had murdered his family was at large and constantly being asked questions about it. Harry finally had someone who could almost relate to his state of mind. Susan was pestered throughout the year by students asking about her family and its murdered members, which she found distressing.<ref name=\"OP25\"/>\n\n[[File:Bullied_susan.PNG|235x235px|thumb|Susan being bullied by [[Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] for being a member of the Bones family]]\n\nOn top of dealing with the murders of her family members, this year was also her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], which left her in even greater stress as she attempted to keep it all together and do well in her exams. Also, on at least one occasion Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle took it upon themselves to bully Susan, making fun of her aunt and complaining that she was interfering with the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]'s agenda. They went so far as to take her wand, and [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] had to come to her aid. The trio duelled the two Slytherins, defeating them and forcing them to leave Susan alone. Susan got her wand back and learned about the D.A. meeting in the [[Room of Requirement]].<ref name=\"OOTPG\">{{OOTP|G}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the year, Susan was among the D.A. members who came to Harry's aid when he was attacked on the [[Hogwarts Express]] by Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle, her own erstwhile bullies. Susan and her friends all unleashed a volley of [[jinx]]es and [[hex]]es which reduced the three to gigantic slugs.<ref name=\"OOTP38\">{{OOTP|B|38}}</ref>\n\n====Sixth year====\n{{Dialogue a-b|Girl 1|Did you hear about her aunt?

When Susan returned to Hogwarts, she was learning how to [[Apparition|Apparate]] and on one occasion [[Splinching|Splinched]] herself during one of the lessons, losing one of her legs. Her leg was successfully reattached, but the incident appeared to leave Susan somewhat shaken.<ref name=\"HBP18\"/>\n\nLater on in the school year, Hogwarts fell [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower|under attack]] by Death Eaters. The D.A. members were called to arms via [[Dumbledore's Army coin|their coins]], and despite the murder of her aunt, Susan did not show up for battle, and possibly try and avenge her, it is possible that since the D.A. meetings were no longer held that Susan no longer carried her coin around with her and did not notice the call to arms message.\n\n====Seventh year and [[Battle of Hogwarts]]====\n{{Quote|We have already placed protection around the castle, but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it. I must ask you therefore to \u2014|McGonagall preps the students before battle|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\n\nSusan returned to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] for her seventh year, at which point the school was under the indirect control of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. If she did not, she would have been a fugitive, since attendance was compulsory for children of magical families that year. Susan would have been in danger anyway, what with her being a member of the Bones family. A wizarding family high on Voldemort's list to eliminate, as most of them were stanch supports of Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix.<ref name=\"DHF2\"/>\n\n[[File:Voldemort vanquished.png|250x250px|thumb|Susan and the other defenders of Hogwarts witness [[Harry Potter]]'s final defeat of Voldemort]]\n\nShe rejoined [[Dumbledore's Army]], which had been reformed in a protest against Snape and the [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow|Carrows]] and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts alongside members of the [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] and her professors. She was most likely in the Great Hall during the second half of the battle and witnessed Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort and therefore the end to the [[Second Wizarding War]], as she was not listed among the deceased.<ref name=\"DHF2\">{{DH|F2}}</ref>\n\n==Physical appearance==\nSusan was known for wearing her hair in a long plait down her back.<ref name=\"OP16\" /> In [[1996]], Susan [[Splinching|splinched]] herself whilst practising [[Apparition]], and in doing so she lost one of her legs. However Susan was able to have her leg successfully reattached by the Heads of Houses but the ordeal left her confidence somewhat shaken.<ref name=\"HBP18\">{{HBP|B|18}}</ref>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Susan was a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]] in her fifth year,<ref name=\"OP16\"/> and learned how to cast many defensive and offensive spells under [[Harry Potter]]'s exemplary teaching.<ref name=\"OOTP38\"/><ref name=\"OOTPG\"/>\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': She also fought in, and most likely survived, the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], given how her name was not those among the fallen deceased, showing she had a level of skill in [[martial magic]].<ref name=\"DHF2\"/> Susan and her friends also attacked [[Draco Malfoy]], [[Gregory Goyle]] and [[Vincent Crabbe]] with a variety of [[dark charm]]s that made them resemble [[slug]]s, showing she had skill in [[martial magic]].<ref name=\"OOTP38\"/>\n\n==Possessions==\n*'''[[Wand]]''': Like all wizards and witches, it can be assumed that Susan's [[wand]] was among her most valued possessions and that she purchased it from [[Ollivanders]] at the age of eleven. Her wand was of unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] material.<ref name=\"OOTPG\"/>\n\n==Relationships==\n===Family===\n{{Quote|Susan Bones' grandparents were killed by Voldemort.|J. K. Rowling in a interview|Accio Quote!}}\n\n[[File:Amelia Bones.jpg|227x227px|thumb|left|[[Amelia Bones]], her aunt]]\n\nNot much is known about the relationship of Susan with her family. Susan was a member of the [[Bones family]], a family of many great witches and wizards. The Bones family supported the [[Order of the Phoenix]] during the [[First Wizarding War]]. That was the reason why the most of them were murdered by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] or his [[Death Eaters]]. Her grandparents, uncle [[Edgar Bones|Edgar]], his [[Edgar Bones's wife|wife]], and their [[Edgar Bones's children|children]]. [[Amelia Bones]], who participated in Harry Potter's hearing was Susan's aunt. They seemed to have a close relationship. However, Amelia was killed by Voldemort in 1996.\n\n===Dumbledore's Army===\n{{Dialogue a-b-c|Gregory Goyle |My father reckons your aunt's a troublemaker, someone will teach her a lesson!|Susan|What do you want?

Susan became a member during her fifth year, in order to be taught [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] by Harry, as [[Dolores Umbridge]], the new D.A.D.A. professor, didn't teach them how to properly defend themselves, thinking they would oppose the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].<ref name=\"OP16\"/>\n\nSusan became a member, along with her fellow [[Hufflepuff]]s [[Hannah Abbott]], [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]] and [[Zacharias Smith]].<ref name=\"OP16\"/> Susan shared a dormitory with [[Hannah Abbott]] (a fellow Hufflepuff) and was most probably invited to join [[Dumbledore's Army]] by her. She may have been also a close friend of Ernie and Justin. It is unknown if she was a friend of Zacharias, too. Susan and her fellow housemates (except Zacharias) fought for [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].\n\nShe was very impressed by learning that Harry could cast a Patronus, and she also told him how she felt about her relatives' deaths during the [[First Wizarding War]].<ref name=\"OP16\"/>\n\nShe was also seemed to be a friend of [[Seamus Finnigan]], whom she shared a boat with on her first year and was often seen talking to him in lessons and in [[Dumbledore's Army]] meetings.<ref name=\"PSF\"/>\n\nOther members of the army she possibly knew are [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], [[Parvati Patil]], [[Lavender Brown]], [[Dean Thomas]], [[Padma Patil]], [[Luna Lovegood]], [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Alicia Spinnet]], [[Angelina Johnson]], [[Katie Bell]], [[Fred and George Weasley]], [[Colin Creevey|Colin]] and [[Dennis Creevey]], [[Terry Boot]], [[Anthony Goldstein]], [[Michael Corner]], [[Cho Chang]] and [[Marietta Edgecombe]].<ref name=\"OP16\"/> The majority of them fought at the Battle of Hogwarts and their fate is ambiguous.\n\n==Etymology==\n*\"Susan\" is the Anglicised form of Susanna, meaning Lily or Rose.<ref>[http://www.ancestry.com/facts/Potter-family-history-uk.ashx?fn=Susanna Ancestry.com etymologies]</ref> The lily is often a symbol of purity. It is noted that Susan is most likely named after her Aunt [[Amelia Bones]], whose middle name is Susan.\n*\"Bones\" is the word for the skeletal form of a being, many members of Susan's family are murdered or have been killed during the books and this may be in reference to this.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Da-susan.jpg|150px|thumb|Susan Bones as depicted on {{PM}}]]\n[[File:Susan_Bones_LEGO_mini-figure.jpg|thumb|Susan Bones as a LEGO mini-figure]]\n*In the first two films, she was played by [[Eleanor Columbus]], the daughter of director [[Chris Columbus]], making her one of the few [[United States of America|American]] actresses to appear in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]] as one of the students. However, she had no dialogue. She was portrayed by [[Emma Jayne-Corboz]] in the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (film)|film adaptations]] of {{DH}}.\n*She is one of the Original Forty students listed by [[J. K. Rowling]] along with [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ronald Weasley]].\n*In the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{OOTP}}, Susan was voiced by [[Alex Tregear]].\n*Susan wears her hair in a long plait down her back, however in the films and video games she is shown to leave her hair down.\n*The middle name of Amelia Bones is Susan, which could imply that Susan was named after her aunt, or that the name Susan runs in the Bones family.\n*In {{OOTP|FA}}, Susan is omitted and one of Susan's lines is spoken instead by [[Luna Lovegood]].\n**Susan appears in the [http://atrossbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-2nd-draft.pdf earliest draft] of the fifth film where she says \"''That is most remarkable, Mr Potter''\".\n*In the books, the sorting is done in alphabetical order, but in the films, it is not, and in 1991, Susan is the third sorted. She shows relief when put into Hufflepuff, suggesting that her family may all be in Hufflepuff. Susan is the only non-major character in the series whose Sorting is shown onscreen (the others being Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, and Lily, though the latter was in another year and shown in a memory.)\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Susan Bones}}\n[[File:SusanBonesLEGOY1-4.png|thumb|Susan Bones as she appears in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]\n*{{PS}} {{1st}}\n*{{PS|F}}\n*{{COS|F}}\n*{{OOTP}}\n*{{OOTP|F}} {{C|Name appears on Parchment}} {{Possible}}<ref>[[Unidentified Hufflepuff member of Dumbledore's Army|Unidentified Hufflepuff girl (I)]] might be her.</ref>\n*{{OOTP|G}}\n*{{HBP}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{Mention}}<ref>During game play some students when you walk past will say \"Did you hear about her Aunt?
