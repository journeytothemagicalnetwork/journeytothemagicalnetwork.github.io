Potter|Lily Potter]], the destruction of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s corporeal body, as well as the inadvertent creation of a [[Horcrux]], [[Harry Potter]]. The night that followed turned out to be the major upheaval of Bagnold's term in office since [[wizardkind|wizards]] up and down the country started [[Fall of Lord Voldemort celebrations|celebrating Voldemort's downfall]] and the end of the [[First Wizarding War]] in what became \"a night of large-scale breaches of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|International Wizarding Statute of Secrecy]]\"<ref name=\"wombat\" /><ref name=\"PS1\">{{PS|B|1}}</ref> Bagnold defended these celebrations by famously stating that she asserted the wizards' \"inalienable right to party.\"<ref name=\"pottermore\" />\n\n[[File:Wizengamot.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] trials before the [[Council of Magical Law]]]]\nIt was also during her term in office that [[Death Eaters]] [[Igor Karkaroff]], [[Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus]], [[Rabastan Lestrange|Rabastan]], [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], as well as [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Bartemius Crouch Jnr]] were rounded up and tried before the [[Council of Magical Law]] and sent to [[Azkaban]].<ref name=\"GF30\">{{GOF|B|30}}</ref> [[Sirius Black]] was falsely accused to be one of Voldemort's supporters and one of those responsible for the murders of [[James Potter I|James]] and [[Lily J.

[[Hermione Granger]] reached out to Bagnold but she said she presided over many such trials as Minister and could not recall any specific details: Hermione speculated that Bagnold's memory of that day might have been [[Memory Charm|tampered with]], but ultimately found it more likely \"that her age [had] caught up with her\".<ref name=\"WU\">{{WU}} ([[Registry: Adversaries Events]])</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Bagnold's term in office was almost the same as [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Prime Minister]] {{Wplink|Margaret Thatcher}}'s ([[1979]]-[[1990]]).\n*She shares the same first name and last initial as [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] [[Slytherin]] student [[Millicent Bulstrode]].\n\n==Etymology==\n*The name \"Millicent\" is from the Germanic name ''Amalasuintha'', composed of the elements ''amal'' \"work, labour\" and ''swin\u00fe'' \"strength\".\n*Her last name is probably derived from the English author and playwright [[Wikipedia:Enid Bagnold|Enid Bagnold]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{PS}} {{1st mention}}\n*{{GOF}} {{Mention}}\n*{{OOTP}} {{Mention}}\n*{{JKRS}} {{Mention}}\n*{{PM}} {{Mention}}\n*{{WW}} {{Mention}}\n*{{WU}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bagnold, Millicent}}\n\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=[[Harold Minchum]]\n|position=[[Minister for Magic]]\n|years=[[1980]]\u2014[[1990]]\n|successor=[[Cornelius Fudge]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n{{Minister for Magic}}\n\n[[de:Millicent Bagnold]]\n[[de2:Millicent Bagnold]]\n[[es:Millicent Bagnold]]\n[[fr:Millicent Bagnold]]\n[[pl:Milicenta Bagnold]]\n[[pt-br:Millicent Bagnold]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0411\u0430\u0433\u043d\u043e\u043b\u0434]]\n[[zh:\u7c73\u91cc\u68ee\u00b7\u5df4\u683c\u8bfa]]\n[[ja:\u30df\u30ea\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30d0\u30b0\u30ce\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9]]\n[[Category:British Ministers for Magic]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
