A [[Hufflepuff]] student in her early years at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], Lufkin became the first woman ever to hold the office and was elected at least twice, serving from [[1798]] to [[1811]].\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nArtemisia was born in [[1754]],<ref name=\"COS\">{{COS|G}}</ref> somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]], to at least one magical parent. In her youth, she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from around [[1765]] to [[1772]], where she was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff]].<ref name=\"pottermore2\" />\n\n===As Minister for Magic===\n\nIn [[1798]], Ms. Lufkin rose to the position of [[Minister for Magic]] of [[Great Britain]], and [[Ireland]], succeeding [[Unctuous Osbert]], and became the first woman ever to have held the office.<ref name=\"COS\">{{COS|G}}</ref>\n\nAs Minister for Magic, she established the [[Department of International Magical Co-operation]] and lobbied hard and successfully to have a [[Quidditch World Cup]] tournament held in Britain during her term.<ref name=\"PMministers\">{{WW|ministers-for-magic}}</ref>\n\nShe served as Minister for thirteen years, being succeeded in the post by [[Grogan Stump]] in [[1811]].\n\n===Death and post-mortem===\n[[File:Artemisia_Lufkin-30-chocFrogCard.png|thumb|left|Artemisia Lufkin's silver [[Chocolate Frog Card]]]]\nMs. Lufkin passed away in [[1825]], aged around 71. She was featured in a [[Chocolate Frog Card]] by the [[1990s]].<ref name=\"COS\">{{COS|G}}</ref>\n\nOn [[1 September]], [[1991]], [[Prefect]] [[Gabriel Truman]] welcomed the [[Hufflepuff]] [[first year]]s to [[Hufflepuff Basement]] with a short speech in which he mentioned former Minister Artemisia Lufkin as one of the many notable Hogwarts students who had been [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]], like them, into Hufflepuff.<ref name=\"pottermore2\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n*Artemisia is a feminine form of Artemisios,<ref>\"[http://www.behindthename.com/name/artemisia Artemisia]\" on Behind the Name</ref> a Greek name which derived from [[Wikipedia:Artemis|Artemis]],<ref>\"[http://www.behindthename.com/name/artemisios Artemisios]\" on Behind the Name</ref> the name of the Greek maiden daughter of Zeus and Leto, and the twin sister of Apollo. She is the goddess of the moon, hunting, the wilderness, and the gift of taming wild animals.<ref>\"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis Artemis]\" on Wikipedia</ref>\n*[[Wikipedia:Artemisia (genus)|Artemisia]] is also the name of a [[Wikipedia:Genus|genus]] of plants that includes [[Wikipedia:Sagebrush|sagebrush]] and [[wormwood]].<ref>\"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_(genus) Artemisia (genus)]\" on Wikipedia</ref>\n*[[Wikipedia:Artemisia Gentileschi|Artemisia Gentileschi]] was a pioneering Italian painter of the [[Wikipedia:Baroque|Baroque]] movement, the first woman to join the [[Wikipedia:Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze|Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze]], as well as one of the first to handle religious and historical subjects.<ref>\"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_Gentileschi Artemisia Gentileschi]\" on Wikipedia</ref>\n*Lufkin is a pet form of the Middle English given name Love,<ref>\"[http://www.ancestry.com/facts/Lufkin-family-history-sct.ashx Lufkin]\" on Ancestry.com</ref> which derived from either the Old English girl's name ''Lufu'', meaning \"[[love]]\", or its masculine equivalent ''Lufa''.<ref>\"[http://www.ancestry.com/facts/Love-family-history-sct.ashx Love]\" on Ancestry.com</ref>\n**The meaning of her surname is rather curious and ironic, considering \"''Lufa-Lufa''\" is the Portuguese name for Hufflepuff, the house she was sorted in, and the suffix 'kin' is often used to refer to a person's children. In other words, her surname can be rather fittingly interpreted as \"child of Hufflepuff\".\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Artemisia as depicted on her Chocolate Frog Card has an uncanny resemblance to Lady Tremaine as depicted in the Walt Disney animated film Cinderella released in 1950.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Artemisia Lufkin}}\n*{{PS|G}} {{FWC}}\n*{{COS|G}} {{FWC}}\n*''[[Wizard of the Month]]''\n*{{PM}} {{Mention}}\n*{{WW}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=[[Unctuous Osbert]]\n|position=[[Minister for Magic]]\n|years=[[1798]]-[[1811]]\n|successor=[[Grogan Stump]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n{{Minister for Magic}}\n{{Chocolate Frog Cards}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lufkin, Artemisia}}\n\n[[de:Artemisia Lufkin]]\n[[de2:Artemisia Lufkin]]\n[[es:Artemisia Lufkin]]\n[[fi:Artemisia Lufkin]]\n[[fr:Artemisia Lufkin]]\n[[it:Artemisia Lufkin]]\n[[no:Artemisia Lufkin]]\n[[pl:Artemizja Lufkin]]\n[[pt-br:Artemisia Lufkin]]\n[[ru:\u0410\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0437\u0438\u044f \u041b\u0430\u0444\u043a\u0438\u043d]]\n[[zh:\u963f\u7279\u7c73\u5e0c\u4e9a\u00b7\u9732\u8299\u91d1]]\n[[Category:1754 births]]\n[[Category:1825 deaths]]\n[[Category:British Ministers for Magic]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Historical figures]]\n[[Category:Hufflepuffs]]\n[[Category:Silver Chocolate Frog Cards]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1760s]]\n[[Category:Wizard of the Month]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
