She was the daughter of [[Angus Buchanan's father|Mr]] and [[Angus Buchanan's mother|Mrs Buchanan]] and the older sister of [[Angus Buchanan]].<ref name=\"PM\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nBorn into the [[wizardkind|wizarding]] [[Buchanan family]] sometime in the mid-[[19th century]], Flora grew up in a village in the [[Scottish Borders]] with ten siblings, including [[Hamish Buchanan|Hamish]] and [[Angus Buchanan|Angus]] (the latter of whom, at least, was younger than her). The Buchanan children had a reputation for being rowdy and large. Flora and her sisters won the village [[tug-of-war]] competition every year.<ref name=\"PM\"/>\n\nWhen Flora turned eleven, she received a [[Hogwarts acceptance letter]], and began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. The local [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] villagers, who were unaware of the Buchanan family's [[magic]]al heritage, assumed that she had been sent to a corrective facility or mental institution. It is unknown which [[Hogwarts Houses|House]] she was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into whilst she attended Hogwarts.<ref name=\"PM\"/>\n\nFlora and her other siblings were especially fond of their brother Angus. Since [[Angus Buchanan's father|their father]] was highly prejudiced against [[Squib]]s, Flora and her siblings covered for Angus when, unlike them, he displayed no signs of [[magic]]al ability. After no Hogwarts acceptance letter arrived for Angus, Flora forged one for him, thus keeping their parents in the dark for a few more weeks.<ref name=\"PM\">{{WW|scottish-rugby}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{PM}} {{1st Mention}}\n*{{WW}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Buchanan, Flora}}\n[[de:Flora Buchanan]]\n[[pl:Flora Buchanan]]\n[[pt-br:Flora Buchanan]]\n[[ru:\u0424\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0411\u044c\u044e\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d]]\n[[Category:19th century births]]\n[[Category:Buchanan family|Flora]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Scottish individuals]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
