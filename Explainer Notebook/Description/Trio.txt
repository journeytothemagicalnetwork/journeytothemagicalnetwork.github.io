The trio was allied with the [[Order of the Phoenix]], [[Dumbledore's Army]], and [[Albus Dumbledore]], and in their adult lives and careers, the [[British Ministry of Magic]].\n\n==Members==\n[[Harry Potter]] was one of the most famous [[Wizardkind|wizards]] of modern time, also known as the 'Boy Who Lived'<ref name=\"PS1\">{{PS|B|1}}</ref> and the 'Chosen One'.<ref name=\"HBP3\">{{HBP|B|3}}</ref> He is known for being the cause of Voldemort's first downfall and is responsible for the Dark Lord's final defeat.<ref name=\"PS1\"/><ref name=\"PS4\">{{PS|B|4}}</ref> Harry was also the teacher/leader of [[Dumbledore's Army]]<ref name=\"OOTP18\"/> and was the best in his year at [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]].<ref name=\"OOTP15\">{{OOTP|B|15}}</ref> After the [[Second Wizarding War]] he became an [[Auror]] and rose to the position of Head Auror at the age of 26.

K. Rowling]] would use HRH for short in her writing.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoBPOZznSvY A Conversation between JK Rowling and Steve Kloves]</ref>\n*The term has been widely adopted by fans and is used for the title of \"[[The Trio theme]]\" heard in the films of {{DH}}. [[Harry Potter (book series)|''Harry Potter'']] series author [[J. K. Rowling]] also once used the term in a [[2007]] interview.<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0730-bloomsbury-chat.html J.K. Rowling and the Live Chat, Bloomsbury.com, July 30, 2007]</ref>\n*Interestingly, the members of the Golden Trio have all three of the [[blood status]]es of the [[wizarding world]] as Harry is a [[half-blood]], Ron is a [[pure-blood]], and Hermione is a [[Muggle-born]].\n**Harry's a half-blood because his father James came from a family like Ron's whereas his mother Lily is a Muggle-born like Hermione.\n*The Trio also differ from each other in appearance. They each have different [[eye]] colours. Harry has green eyes (although portrayed as blue in the films), Ron has blue eyes (although often portrayed as green or brown), and Hermione has brown eyes.\n**Harry and Ron flipping eye colours in the films can be attributed to a bad reaction Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) had to coloured contacts.\n*They not only have differing eye colours, but also various hair colours. Harry has black hair (although portrayed as dark brown in the films), Ron has red hair, and Hermione has brown hair (although portrayed as somewhere between light brown and dirty blonde in the films).\n*All three members are related or blood related to the [[Weasley family|Weasleys]], as Ron is a Weasley, Hermione married Ron making her a Weasley by marriage, and Harry married into the Weasley family through Ginny making him an in-law to the Weasley family, as well.\n*The three are related in some way to the [[House of Black|Black family]].\n**Harry is the godson of [[Sirius Black]], who was also the best friend of his late father, [[James Potter I|James Potter]], and the husband of [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], the only granddaughter of [[Cedrella Black]]. He is also related in some way to [[Dorea Black]], her husband, [[Charlus Potter]], and their [[Charlus Potter's son|son]].\n**Ron is, like Ginny, one of Cedrella Black's grandchildren.\n**Like Harry, Hermione ended up marrying one of Cedrella Black's grandchildren, Ron. [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Her]] [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|children]], therefore, are also descendants of the Black family.\n*Each of their wand cores is a core of the wands made in [[Ollivanders]]: Hermione's wand's core is [[dragon heartstring]], Ron's first and second wand cores are [[unicorn hair]], and Harry's is [[phoenix feather|phoenix tail feather]].\n*Interestingly, despite Harry being the leader of the Trio he is actually the youngest of the three, whereas Hermione is the oldest and Ron is the second oldest.\n*The three bring different parts to the Trio, Harry brings leadership and power, Ron brings muscle and comedy, and Hermione brings intelligence and reason.\n*The three also come from different socioeconomic backgrounds: Harry comes from the quietly rich and wealthy Potter line, Ron is from the almost iconically poor Weasley family, and Hermione is not mentioned to come from any exceptional wealth or poverty, so it is assumed that her dentist parents are comfortably middle-class.\n*The Trio is an example of a [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianTrio Freudian Trio].\n*In addition to referring to Harry, Ron, and Hermione as the \"Golden Trio\", some fandom members consider [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], [[Neville Longbottom]], and [[Luna Lovegood]] to comprise a second \"Silver Trio\".\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of the Trio}}\n*{{PS}} {{1st}}\n*{{PS|F}}\n*{{PS|G}}\n*{{COS}}\n*{{COS|F}}\n*{{COS|G}}\n*{{POA}}\n*{{POA|F}}\n*{{POA|G}}\n*{{GOF}}\n*{{GOF|F}}\n*{{GOF|G}}\n*{{OOTP}}\n*{{OOTP|F}}\n*{{OOTP|G}}\n*{{HBP}}\n*{{HBP|F}}\n*{{HBP|G}}\n*{{DH}}\n*{{DH|F1}}\n*{{DH|G1}}\n*{{DH|F2}}\n*{{DH|G2}}\n*{{CC}}\n*{{CC|P}}\n*{{TBB|R}} {{Mention}}\n*{{QTA|R}} {{Mention}}\n*{{FB|R}} {{Mention}}\n*{{HPPU}}\n*{{QH}}\n*{{LEGO|B}}\n*{{LEGO|C}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}}\n*{{LEGO|C1}}\n*{{LEGO|C2}}\n*{{LEGO|D}}\n*{{LEGO}}\n*{{HPFJ}}\n*{{DH|ME}}\n*{{PM}}\n*{{WW}}\n*{{TCG}}\n*{{QWC}}\n*{{HPK}}\n*{{HPV|CH}}\n*{{HPV|CR}}\n*{{MPF}}\n*{{WU}}\n*{{MA}}\n*{{PAS}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[es:Tr\u00edo]]\n[[fr:Trio]] \n[[it:Trio]]\n[[ru:\u0417\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0422\u0440\u0438\u043e]]\n[[ja:\u30c8\u30ea\u30aa]]\n[[Category:Battle of Hogwarts participants]]\n[[Category:Cliques]]\n[[Category:Dumbledore's Army]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]"
