He lived with his parents. A [[ghost]] also resided at his home, and Ben was the only one who could see it, being a wizard.<ref>{{HM|5|11|hm}}</ref>\n===Hogwarts years {{C|1984-1991}}===\n====First year====\nBen began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1984]]. On journey on the [[Hogwarts Express]], he was tormented the entire time by [[Merula Snyde]], who kept threatening him and calling him a \"[[Mudblood]].\"\n\nHe was later [[sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]]. As a result of Merula's bullying, he spent his first days at Hogwarts following her around, hoping this would prevent her from sneaking up on him, or give him a chance to run away if she did.{{fact}} This coupled with the fact that, as a [[Muggle-born]], he found the [[wizarding world]] new and scary, made him think he did not belong in Gryffindor. One of his fears was [[Flight|flying]], which [[Jacob's sibling]] later helped him overcome.<ref>{{HM|1|Afraid to Fly}}</ref> Ben became particularly skilled in [[Charms (class)|Charms]] whilst studying.\n\nDue to Merula\u2019s bullying he asked the prefect to teach him how to duel with the help of Jacob\u2019s sibling. Jacob\u2019s sibling duelled him to help teach him.\n\n====Second year====\nBen went missing at the beginning of the [[1985\u20131986 school year]]. Having last been seen on the Hogwarts Express, [[Rowan Khanna]] and Jacob's sibling went looking for him in the [[Artefact Room]], where they found a note with a code written by a person named R, instructing the reader to go to one of the Hogwarts [[common room]]s and untransfigured a Black Quill to a note with the next hint. They believed that the note was intended for Ben.<ref>{{HM|2|1}}</ref>\n\nBen was later found on a fifth-floor corridor, later to be known as the [[Icy Corridor]], trapped in [[cursed ice]], and was freed by Professors [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]] and [[Severus Snape|Snape]], and taken to the [[Hospital Wing]]. He told his friends that he couldn't remember how he got to the corridor.<ref>{{HM|2|3}}</ref>\n\nAfter being released from the hospital wing, Ben assisted Jacob's sibling in finding [[dragon horn]]s for [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s [[Fire-Breathing Potion]]. Ben kept some powdered dragon horn in the Artefact Room, where he recurrently used to hide from [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] and other students.<ref>{{HM|2|Help Hagrid!}}</ref>\n\nWhen Jacob's sibling and [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] unsuccessfully attempted to enter the [[Vault of Ice]], Jacob's sibling helped Ben learn to make [[Burn-Healing Paste]] in [[Potions (class)|Potions]] in preparation for their next try at the vaults.<ref>{{HM|2|8}}</ref>\n\n====Third year====\nIn his third year, Ben took [[Care of Magical Creatures]],<ref name=\"HM41\">{{HM|4|1|cmc}}</ref> [[Arithmancy (class)|Arithmancy]]<ref>{{HM|6|7}}, Ben asks if he should become a [[Curse-Breaker]] and if the player answers yes, one of the reasons stated is that he enjoys Arithmancy.</ref> and the [[Muggle Studies]]<ref name=\"HM73\">{{HM|7|3}}</ref> as electives.\n\nDuring the [[1986\u20131987 school year]], Ben helped Jacob's sibling, who was helping [[Rubeus Hagrid]], look for [[Fang]] in the [[Artefact Room]].<ref name=\"HM3GP\">{{HM|3|Giant Problems}}</ref>\n\n====Fourth year====\n[[File:Messenger.png|250px|thumb|right|Ben Copper disguised as R's messenger]]\nDuring the [[1987\u20131988 school year]], Ben<ref name=\"HM415\">{{HM|4|15}}</ref> sent a a fake letter to Jacob's sibling telling them to meet [[Silvanus Kettleburn]], which was actually a bait to lure them to the [[Courtyard]], where, while wearing a red cloak and using a [[Disillusionment Charm]] to conceal his face, attacked them with the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] and told them to stay away from the [[Cursed Vaults]], the [[Forbidden Forest]] and [[Patricia Rakepick]], further adding that \"death is coming to Hogwarts\" and that may come to them as well if they disobey. He then told them that someone would eventually remove the binding curse, but it is unknown who did so.<ref name=\"HM43\">{{HM|4|3}}</ref> After freed, Jacob's sibling only told about this incident to a few friends.\n\n[[File:Ben Copper revealed HM415.png|thumb|250px|left|Ben Copper exposed as the cloaked figure in red]]\nHe later confronted [[Jacob's sibling]] in the Courtyard when they were about to go meet [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] before heading to the [[Forest Vault]]. He told them that \"death\" had come or them and duelled them, gaining the upper hand before being prevented from killing Jacob's sibling by [[Patricia Rakepick|Madam Rakepick]] who knocked Ben back with the [[Blasting Curse]], before Jacob's sibling removed the [[Disillusionment Charm]] hiding Ben's face with the [[General Counter-Spell]], exposing him to his shocked friend. He claimed he could not remember anything and claimed to Jacob's sibling that he would never attack them. Jacob's sibling then told [[Patricia Rakepick|Madam Rakepick]] to send him to either [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] in the Hospital Wing, [[Argus Filch]] or to the [[Headmaster's Office]] to let Headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] found out the truth before going off to meet Hagrid.<ref name=\"HM415\"/>\n\n====Sixth year====\n[[File:Duel in the Forest Grove.gif|thumb|left|200px|Ben bravely duelling Patricia Rakepick in the Forbidden Forest]]\nSometime during the [[1989\u20131990 school year]], Ben, along with [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Merula Snyde]], went into the [[Forest Grove]] to intercept a possible meeting between [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] and [[R]], unknowingly being followed from a close distance behind them by their friend, [[Rowan Khanna]]. During the search, a swarm of [[dementor]]s showed up, and circled the group. The three began to cast [[Patronus Charm|Patronuses]], but they were unsuccessful, as there were too many dementors. The [[Dark Wizard|dark witch]] [[Patricia Rakepick]] then [[Apparition|Apparated]] into the vicinity and cast a powerful Patronus Charm, which warded off all of the dementors. She then engaged in [[Duel in the Forest Grove|a duel]] with the students, which was watched by Rowan. At some point in the duel, she cast a [[Killing Curse]] at Ben, intending to kill him. However, Rowan sacrificed their life by jumping in front of Ben, ending their life and saving that of their friends.<ref name=\"HM618\"/> Ben greatly grieved over the loss, prompting him to want to join Jacob's sibling and Merula in forming an organisation to combat [[R]]. The three then created the group and met up with members in the [[Hog's Head Inn]], where Ben suggested \"[[Circle of Khanna]]\" as a group name, which was agreed upon by the group. Following the formation of the group, Ben tirelessly worked to improve his skills in combat, greatly wanting to avenge Rowan by fighting R.<ref name=\"HM620\"/>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Ben Copper.jpeg|180px|thumb|Ben Copper]]\nBen was very insecure about his capabilities. He also feared that people would judge him because of his Muggle-born status. It is also shown that his nervousness is his greatest hold back with his magic, since he was able to completely trounce, and almost kill, Jacob's sibling while not even thinking about it.\n\nLate in his fifth year, Ben got a desire to be more brave.<ref>{{HM|5|27}}</ref> In his sixth year, Ben had a notable change in personality. He was no longer openly scared of everything, and considered himself to be a better person than before. He also saw himself as more grown-up, not attending the [[Start-of-Term Feast]] because he considered it to be for kids.<ref>{{HM|6|1}}</ref> Ultimately, however, the real reason behind his change of personality was to protect his friends, even if he became distant towards them and focused more on his training, and he showed how much he cared for them when he bravely fought Rakepick and stood up even after being knocked down to protect Jacob's sibling and Merula to the point that Rakepick acknowledged how far Ben had grew and proved himself a true Gryffindor and was devastated by Rowan's death to the point of being left numb and even more determined to improve his skills to protect his remaining friends.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\nWhile noted for his gift in charms, Ben Copper was seldom counted among one of the more powerful or skilful students in Jacob's siblings band of misfits, let alone at Hogwarts as a whole. It would turn out, however, that only his lack of confidence held him back, seen as how Ben, when not restricted by it, used [[magic]] far beyond his educational level, being able to defeat Jacob's sibling, a powerful wizard themselves for their age in a duel to the [[death]] and likely would, if not for the timely(perhaps planned) arrival of Patricia Rakepick, have killed them.\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Ben had a natural ability in charms work, excelling in the [[Charms (class)|subject]] and was able to cast charms of great power and complexity when not held back by his own insecurities.\n*'''[[Non-verbal magic]]''': Ben was remarkably proficient in casting non-verbal magic, notably being able to briefly hold his own in a ferocious duel against the incredibly powerful [[Patricia Rakepick]] with a series of non-verbally performed spells, although he was ultimately overpowered by the malevolent witch.\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': When duelling to the best of his ability, not restricted by worries of the outcome or having his efforts coloured by whom he was competing against and his concerns of their potentially superior ability, Ben made for an incredibly dangerous duellist for someone his age. He was able to floor Jacob's sibling, a powerful and skilled duellist themselves for their age, with a [[Banishing Charm]] so powerful it broke straight through their [[Shield Charm]] and knocked them to the ground. He was also able to cast a surprisingly effective [[Full Body-Bind Curse]], which paralysed Jacob's sibling and further showcasing his talent for performing [[martial magic]]. When confronted and attacked by the immensely formidable [[Patricia Rakepick]] in his sixth year, he was able to briefly hold his own against the dark witch, performing many of his spells both flawlessly and non-verbally. He was notably able to last much longer against Rakepick than either of his accomplices, [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Merula Snyde]], both of whom were one of the most powerful duellists of their year and both of whom were swiftly dispatched by her. Ben was, however, ultimately overpowered by the malevolent witch after a prolonged battle and would have been killed by her had it not been for [[Rowan Khanna]] pushing him out of the path of Rakepick's [[Killing Curse]] and taking the hit themselves, thus selflessly sacrificing their own life for him.\n*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Ben was skilled in Defence Against the Dark Arts, as he was able to study it further at N.E.W.T.-level, thus showing aptitude in the subject.\n*'''[[Astronomy (class)|Astronomy]]''': Ben was skilled in the field of Astronomy, as he was able to study it further at N.E.W.T.-level, thus showing aptitude in the subject.\n*'''[[Healing magic]]''': Ben has some basic skills in healing magic, as he was able to successfully cast the [[healing spell]] ''[[Episkey]]''.\n*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Though seldom a practitioner of the Dark Arts, Ben was nonetheless surprisingly adept in its usage in duels, being able to successfully cast a vast array of [[dark charm]]s such as the [[Knockback Jinx]], ''[[Langlock]]'', [[Full Body-Bind Curse]], [[Ear-Shrivelling Curse]] and [[Expulso Curse]].\n*'''[[Spell creation]]''': Ben helped [[Badeea Ali]] invent the [[jinx]] ''[[Flipendo Maxima]]'', a more powerful version of the standard Knockback Jinx.<ref name=\"HM618\">{{HM|6|18}}</ref>\n*'''[[Muggle Studies]]''': Ben earned an O.W.L in Muggle Studies and continued the subject at N.E.W.T. level. The subject was easy for him due to his muggle family background.<ref name=\"HM73\">{{HM|7|3}}</ref>\n*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Ben earned an O.W.L. in Transfiguration and continued the subject at N.E.W.T. level.\n*'''[[Arithmancy]]''': Ben earned an O.W.L. in Arithmancy and continued the subject at N.E.W.T. level. Jacob's sibling also mentioned that Ben is one of the few students that enjoyed the subject.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Muggle-born Ben Copper is supremely gifted at Charms.
