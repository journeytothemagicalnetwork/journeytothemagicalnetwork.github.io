I never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the letter from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].|Colin introducing himself to Harry Potter|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\n\n'''Colin Creevey''' ([[1981]] \u2013 [[2 May]], [[1998]]) was a [[Muggle-born]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], son of [[Colin Creevey's father|Mr Creevey]] and Mrs Creevey, and older brother of [[Dennis Creevey|Dennis]]. He was a big fan of the famous [[Harry Potter]], who was a year ahead of him in school. \n\nDuring his [[first year]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], he was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]. He was known for taking several pictures of Harry and other students. During his fourth year, he and Dennis became members of [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter. Colin was expelled from Hogwarts in his sixth year, due to [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s policy of not allowing Muggle-borns to attend the school. On [[2 May]], [[1998]], he snuck into the [[Room of Requirement]] with the rest of Dumbledore's Army and fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], during which he was killed by the [[Death Eaters]]. \n\n==Biography==\n===Early life {{C|1981-1992}}===\nColin Creevey grew up in an ordinary [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] family. He was the son of a milkman and was amazed to find out he was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who could attend Hogwarts. Colin was continually awestruck at everything to do with the [[wizarding world]]. Colin had a younger brother named Dennis, who was also a wizard, an unusual thing to occur for two magical offspring to come from Muggle parents.\n\n===Hogwarts years {{C|1992-1997}}===\n====First year====\n{{Dialogue a-b|Colin|What happened, Harry? What happened? Is he ill? But you can cure him, can't you? Oooh, can you hold him still, Harry?|Harry Potter|Get out of the way, Colin!|Colin requesting Ron be poised for a picture after vomiting slugs|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}[[File:Colin camera.gif|250px|thumb|left|Colin Creevey with his camera taking pictures of Harry Potter]]\n\nColin started attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in [[1992]]. He was sorted into [[Gryffindor]]. He was very frequently seen in Hogwarts with a [[Colin Creevey's camera|camera]], worshipping the ground that Harry Potter walked on. At one point he asked for an autographed photo of Harry, prompting [[Draco Malfoy]] to tell everyone Harry was giving out signed photos. Colin responded by accusing Malfoy of being jealous. He was also amazed that he could take moving pictures.<ref name=\"COS6\">{{COS|B|6}}</ref>\n\nHe got his photo with the celebrity [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher [[Gilderoy Lockhart]].<ref name=\"COS6\" /> However, the photographic Harry had refused to appear on the photo, but Lockhart just about managed to drag him into view.<ref name=\"COS6\" /><ref name=\"COS7\">{{COS|B|7}}</ref> When he went to Harry to have the photo signed, Harry was in a rush to get to [[Quidditch]] practise which prompted Colin to say he would go with him, as he had never watched a game before. Harry tried to stop him by claiming it was \"boring\" but Colin went along nevertheless.<ref name=\"COS7\" />\n\n[[File:Colin_bludger.gif|250px|thumb|Colin attempting to take pictures during a Quidditch match and almost gets hit by a [[Bludger]]]]\n\nAs they walked to the pitch, Colin kept asking Harry questions about Quidditch. He asked Harry about flying, whether the [[Nimbus 2000]] was [[Harry Potter's broomsticks|Harry's broomstick]], whether it was the best [[broomstick|broom]] there was (in reality at the time it was the [[Nimbus 2001]], but would later be replaced by the [[Firebolt]]) and finally, the rules of [[Quidditch]] which Harry resigned to explaining. Colin kept asking more questions the whole way, until Harry managed to shake him off at the changing rooms.<ref name=\"COS7\" />\n\nColin sat in the stands taking pictures of the training session, asking Harry at one point to look at him while he took a photo. When Colin saw Ron protecting [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] from [[Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]] and self [[curse]] himself, he went up to them and upon seeing the state of Ron's condition, he eagerly and inappropriately asked Harry to turn him around.<ref name=\"COS7\" />\n\n[[File:Hospital wing colin.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Professors surrounding a petrified Colin in the Hospital Wing]]\n\nAfter [[Mrs Norris]] was petrified, Colin tried to tell Harry what one of the boys in his class had been saying, but he got lost in the crowd before he could say what it was. Presumably, it was that Harry was the [[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]],<ref name=\"COS9\">{{COS|B|9}}</ref> as Harry heard it many times before during the school year.\n\nColin later attended the Quidditch match between [[Gryffindor]] and [[Slytherin]], where he clicked his camera non-stop. He inappropriately took photos of Harry, while he was lying injured in the mud even though Harry told him not to. When Colin saw Harry lose the bones in his broken arm thanks to Lockhart, he began taking even more pictures excitedly.<ref name=\"COS10\">{{COS|B|10}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Petrification.jpg|246x246px|thumb|Colin and the other petrified students being visited by [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]]]\n\nColin decided to sneak up to the Hospital Wing to give Harry grapes, but was [[Petrification|petrified]] by [[Salazar Slytherin]]'s [[Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk|Basilisk]]. Fortunately, he only looked at the snake's eye through the lens of his camera, which saved his life, although the film of his camera was destroyed. His body (along with Penelope Clearwater's) was seen in the Hospital Wing when Harry and Ron were visiting Hermione.<ref name=\"COS10\" /> He was later revived by a [[Mandrake Restorative Draught|Mandrake Draught]].<ref>{{COS|B|17}}</ref>\n\n====Second year====\n{{Dialogue|Colin|Aren't you going to [[Hogsmeade]], Harry? Why not? Hey \u2014  you can come and sit with us, if you like, Harry!|Harry Potter|Er \u2014  no, thanks, Colin. I \u2014  I've got to go to the library, got to get some work done.|Colin enthusiastically invites Harry to join him and his friends|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}\n[[File:ColinCE.PNG|245x245px|thumb|left|Colin Creevey at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall]]\n\nColin's [[second year]] of education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] was a quieter one than his first. Colin was probably shaken and was likely to be keeping his head down to avoid any trouble after the incident in his first year with the [[Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk|Basilisk]]. Colin was among the students that stayed behind at the castle as he was too young whilst the other students visited [[Hogsmeade]]. He stayed behind along with [[Harry Potter]], who had not had his permission slip for Hogsmeade signed. In an effort to avoid Colin, Harry lied and said he needed to return a book to the library.<ref name=\"POA8\">{{POA|B|8}}</ref>\n\n====Third year====\n{{Quote|Harry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother's starting! My brother Dennis!... He's really excited! I just hope he's in Gryffindor! Keep your fingers crossed, eh, Harry?|Colin telling Harry that his brother is starting Hogwarts|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\nDuring the [[Sorting ceremony]] of [[1994]], Colin, in an overly excited manner, told [[Harry Potter]] to cross his fingers because Colin wanted his younger brother, [[Dennis Creevey|Dennis]], to be sorted into the [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]] along with him. Dennis looked at Colin as he walked up to the chair, gave him two thumbs up and whispered that he had fallen from the boat on the way across the lake. When Dennis told him something pulled him from the lake, Colin responded that it was probably the giant squid. Colin was delighted when Dennis was sorted into the same house.<ref name=\"GOF12\">{{GOF|B|12}}</ref>\n\nBefore the [[Wand weighing ceremony]], Colin was sent to collect Harry from his [[Potions (class)|Potions class]] with [[Professor]] [[Severus Snape|Snape]]. Snape was annoyed with Colin interrupting his class, but he begrudgingly let Harry leave and take his belongings with him after Colin informed him Harry's attendance was compulsory for all Triwizard champions. Before the ceremony, Colin wished Harry good luck and told him that photographs would be taken of him for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''.<ref name=\"GOF18\">{{GOF|B|18}}</ref>\n\nBefore the First Task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]], he and his younger brother Dennis got hold of a stack of \"''Support [[Cedric Diggory]]!''\" [[Potter Stinks badge|badges]] and attempted to [[Charm|bewitch]] them to say \"''Support Harry Potter!''\" instead, all they managed to do was get them stuck on \"''POTTER STINKS''\", and later \"''POTTER REALLY STINKS''\". He was likely manipulated by [[Rita Skeeter]] to give info on Harry's love life, as he is quoted saying that Harry was hardly ever seen out of the company of Hermione, a quote with which Colin may have unintentionally started Rita's theory that Hermione was Harry's \"girlfriend\".<ref name=\"GOF19\">{{GOF|B|19}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the year, Cedric Diggory was murdered on [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s orders by [[Peter Pettigrew]] and it was announced that [[Tom Riddle]] had returned. This would have caused significant anxiety for Colin and his brother Dennis, as Voldemort loathed muggle-borns and with rumours of his rise to power upcoming would have almost certainly scared him.\n\n====Fourth year====\n{{Quote|Is it OK if I bring my camera? No, probably not we don't want photos of the secret meetings. I won't bring it then, great, no problem! Thanks again Harry I'll see you later, bye!|Colin to Harry Potter regarding the D.A. meetings|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)}}\n[[File:ColinCreev.PNG|235x235px|thumb|Colin Creevey and [[Harry Potter]] in the Room of Requirement after a D.A. meeting]]\n\nColin's [[fourth year]] would be a year of rebellion amongst the students. The previous school year ended with the start of the [[Second Wizarding War]] after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] returned and [[Killing Curse|murdered]] [[Cedric Diggory]]. However Harry Potter's claims that Voldemort had returned were slated as 'lies' and it wasn't officially announced to be true. Due to the events that took place in Colin's third year, in [[1995]], [[Dolores Umbridge]] was appointed as the eyes of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] to watch over Hogwarts. However, Umbridge was far from what the students had in mind as 'watching over' them, she was a cruel and incompetent teacher who refused to teach practical defensive spells to any students.\n\n[[File:Dumbledore's Army in circle.JPG|245x245px|thumb|left|One of the D.A. meeting, an organisation Colin was part of]]\n\nWith students not being taught [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] in a practical manner, [[Hermione Granger]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and Harry Potter founded an alliance called [[Dumbledore's Army]], which would help students to learn how to defend themselves. Colin and his brother both attended the first meeting of the D.A. at the [[Hog's Head Inn]] in [[Hogsmeade]], and both expressed shock in learning what Harry had done during his school years, especially defeating the [[Basilisk]] that petrified Colin.<ref name=\"OOTP16\">{{OOTP|B|16}}</ref> Colin and his brother Dennis both joined this alliance and were taught defensive magic by Harry; during their meetings he and his brother were regarded as being erratic, causing several books to fly off bookshelves during practise. After three meetings, he managed to master the [[Impediment Jinx]]<ref name=\"OOTP18\">{{OOTP|B|18}}</ref> and the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]].<ref name=\"OOTPG\">{{OOTP|G}}</ref>\n\n====Fifth year====\nNot a lot is known about what happened to Colin during his fifth year. Colin and his brother Dennis applauded Harry Potter after the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] had won the first match of the season, with them wanting a detailed blow by blow analysis.<ref name=\"HBP14\">{{HBP|B|14}}</ref> \n\nWhen [[Death Eaters]] entered Hogwarts and the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] struck, [[Hermione Granger]] called all D.A. members via their coins for reinforcements and Colin was not one of the few members to actually show for battle. Whether he intentionally stayed out of battle or if it was because he no longer carried his coin is unknown. It is likely that Colin stayed for the funeral of [[Albus Dumbledore]], showing his respects to the late headmaster as there was no mention of Colin attempting to take photographs during the procession like he normally would in a situation of some sort.\n\n====Pulled out of Education {{c|1997-1998}}====\nIn 1997, Hogwarts was taken over by [[Severus Snape]] and [[Death Eaters]]. Due to Voldemort's policy of not allowing Muggle-borns to attend the school, Colin and his brother Dennis were unable to attend Hogwarts for their [[sixth year]] and [[fourth year]] of education respectively. It is also likely that the Creeveys went into hiding as there was a [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]] running where any Muggle-born wizards or witches were to be put on trial regarding how they came to possess a wand.\n\n====Battle of Hogwarts and Death====\n{{Quote|Then Neville nearly walked into him. He was one half of a pair that was carrying a body in from the grounds.

He was tiny in death.|[[Oliver Wood]] carrying Colin's dead body into the Great Hall|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\n[[File:Hogwarts_Post-Battle.jpg|245px|thumb|The battle of Hogwarts, where Colin was killed]]\n\nEven though his blood status prevented him from being taught at Hogwarts, Colin returned when he was called, along with other members of [[Dumbledore's Army]]. [[Minerva McGonagall]] dismissed many students from the castle for being [[Underage magic|underage]], however Colin must have returned and participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].<ref name=\"DH32\">{{DH|B|32}}</ref>\n\nHe fought during the first half of the battle and likely went outside the castle, as his body was recovered outside the Great Hall by [[Neville Longbottom]] and [[Oliver Wood]]. He was placed in the [[Great Hall]] alongside the others that had fallen in the battle.<ref name=\"DH32\"/> Colin's sacrifice was not in vain, as the other defenders of Hogwarts defeated all [[Death Eaters]] present. [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] also met his death at the hands of [[Harry Potter]] once and for all, thus ending the Second Wizarding War.\n\n==Physical appearance==\nColin was described as being much shorter than [[Harry Potter]], with mousy brown hair.<ref name=\"COS5\">{{COS|B|5}}</ref><ref name=\"COS6\"/>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Oh, wow! Wait for me! I\u2019ve never watched a [[Quidditch]] game before!|Colin's excitement for all things [[magic]]al|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\n[[File:Colin Creevey.jpg|thumb|A very cheerful young Colin with his camera]]\nColin was a person who was very easily excited. When he first came into Hogwarts, he was excited about everything. He was also a fan of some wizarding \"celebrities\", such as [[Harry Potter]] and [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]. It is possible he had a bit of hero worship for Harry, as he was constantly in awe of anything Harry said or did in their first year together.<ref name=\"COS6\"/> The night he was attacked by the basilisk he was presumed to be trying to sneak into the hospital wing to visit Harry.<ref name=\"COS10\"/> During the Triwizard Tournament he and his brother tried to bewitch a number of \"Potter Stinks\" badges to support Harry, which backfired as they only made the badges say \"Potter Really Stinks\".<ref name=\"GOF19\"/> This hero worship may have reached its peak when he returned to Hogwarts despite not being a student anymore to help defend it against the forces of Lord Voldemort.<ref name=\"DH32\"/>\n\nHe always took pictures in his first year, which could lead to him being often annoying. This was partly due to him taking pictures at inopportune moments, such as when Ron was [[Slug-vomiting Charm|belching slugs]],<ref name=\"COS7\">{{COS|B|7}}</ref> and Harry lost the bones in his arm.<ref name=\"COS10\"/> It was due to this behaviour that some assumed he had been chosen for an attack by the monster in the Chamber of Secrets. \n\nColin was also brave, as he fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]], even though he was outright not allowed by Professor McGonagall, which he defied by sneaking back in, and was killed during the battle.<ref name=\"DH32\"/>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n{{Quote|... how Colin Creevey had mastered the Impediment Jinx after three meetings\u2019 hard effort...|[[Harry Potter]]'s pride in Colin's defensive spell casting skills|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Colin had at least some skill in Defence Against the Dark Arts, as he learned how to cast various defensive and offensive spells as a committed member of [[Dumbledore's Army]].
