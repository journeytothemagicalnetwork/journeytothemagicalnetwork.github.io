During her childhood, she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw]].<ref name=\"pottermore\" />\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|Ravenclaw house has an illustrious history. Most of the greatest wizarding inventors and innovators were in our house, including ''[\u2026]'' Ignatia Wildsmith, the inventor of Floo powder.|[[Robert Hilliard]].|Pottermore}}\nIgnatia Wildsmith was born in [[1227]],<ref name=\"PSg\">{{PS|G}}</ref> somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]].\n\nIn her youth, she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from around [[1230s|1238]] or [[1230s|1239]] to [[1240s|1245]] or [[1240s|1246]], where she was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw]].<ref name=\"pottermore\"/>\n\n===Adulthood===\n[[File:Ignatia WildsmithGBC.png|200px|thumb|left|A younger Ignatia Wildsmith]]\nAfter her graduation from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]], Ms. Wildsmith presumably studied further into [[Herbology]], and discovered the [[magic]]al properties of the [[Floo]] plant. From it, she devised a magical powder, [[Floo Powder]], which, when thrown into a [[fire]], could transport [[wizardkind|wizards]] from one fireplace to another via a [[Floo Network|network of fireplaces]].<ref name=\"PSg\"/>\n\n===Death and post-mortem===\nMs. Wildsmith died in [[1320s|1320]], aged around 93. In her honour, her achievement, the invention of the [[Floo Powder]], was recorded on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name=\"PSg\"/>\n\nOn [[1 September]], [[1991]], [[Prefect]] [[Robert Hilliard]] welcomed the [[Ravenclaw]] [[first year]]s to [[Ravenclaw Tower]] with a short speech in which he mentioned inventor Ignatia Wildsmith as one of the many notable Hogwarts students who had been [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]], like them, into [[Ravenclaw]].<ref name=\"pottermore\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n*\"Ignis\" is [[Latin]] for \"[[fire]]\".\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*On her [[Chocolate Frog Card|Famous Wizard Card]], Ignatia's outfit bears a resemblance to [[w:c:disney:Maleficent|Maleficent]] from Disney's ''[[w:c:disney:Sleeping Beauty|Sleeping Beauty]]''. Throughout the film, Maleficent is associated with green flames, even using them to teleport herself. She also has [[w:c:disney:Diablo|a raven companion]], though this may be coincidental, as Ignatia was not revealed to be a Ravenclaw at the time the card was designed.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Ignatia Wildsmith}}\n[[File:Ignatia Wildsmith Chocolate Frog Card HM.png|thumb|Ignatia Wildsmith immortalised on a silver [[Chocolate Frog Card]]]]\n*{{PS|G}} {{FWC}}\n*{{COS|G}} {{FWC}}\n*{{POA|G}} {{FWC}}\n*''[[Wizard of the Month]]''\n*{{PM}} {{Mention}}\n*{{HM}} {{FWC}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wildsmith, Ignatia}}\n\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=[[Devlin Whitehorn]]\n|position=[[Wizard of the Month]]\n|years=[[December]] [[2004]]\n|successor=[[Derwent Shimpling]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n{{Chocolate Frog Cards}}\n[[de:Ignatia Wildsmith]]\n[[es:Ignatia Wildsmith]]\n[[ru:\u0418\u0433\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0423\u0438\u043b\u0434\u0441\u043c\u0438\u0442]]\n[[pl:Ignatia Wildsmith]]\n[[fr:Ignatia Wildsmith]]\n[[it:Ignatia Wildsmith]]\n[[fi:Ignatia Wildsmith]]\n[[nl:Ignatia Wildsmid]]\n[[sv:Ignatia Wildsmith]]\n[[zh:\u4f0a\u683c\u7eb3\u63d0\u5a05\u00b7\u5a01\u5c14\u5fb7\u53f2\u5bc6\u65af]]\n\n[[Category:1227 births]]\n[[Category:1320 deaths]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Green-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Historical figures]]\n[[Category:Inventors]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Silver Chocolate Frog Cards]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1230s]]\n[[Category:Wizard of the Month]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
