In [[1992]] he became a member of the [[Duelling Club]] and was ranked ten on the Club's top-ten duellists list.<ref>{{COS|G}} - PC version</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Edward\" means \"rich guard\", derived from the Old English elements ''ead'' \"rich, blessed\" and ''weard'' \"guard\". Saint Edward the Confessor was the king of England shortly before the Norman conquest. He was known as a just ruler, and because of his popularity this name remained in use after the conquest when most other Old English names were replaced by Norman ones. The 13th-century king Henry III named his son and successor after the saint, and seven subsequent kings of England were also named Edward. This is one of the few Old English names to be used throughout Europe (in various spellings).\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{COS|G}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Duelling Club}}\n[[es:Edward]]\n[[pl:Edward]]\n[[fr:Laurent]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Duelling Club members]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
