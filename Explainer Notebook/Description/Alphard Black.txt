As revealed in ''[[Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies]]'', Chapter 3 (Horace Slughorn), Slughorn had \"completed half a century of service\" at the time of his retirement in [[1981]], meaning he started teaching there circa [[1931]]. Alphard, born sometime between [[1925]] and [[1938]], would have attended Hogwarts starting in the late [[1930s]] or [[1940s]], and thus would have been a student of Slughorn. [[Sirius Black]] also states \"My whole family have been in Slytherin\" and in Chapter 23 of ''Deathly Hallows'', confirming that at least those Blacks closely related to Sirius were in Slytherin.</ref>\n|loyalty = *[[House of Black]] (disowned posthumously)<ref name=\"BFT\" />\n*[[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]\n**[[Slytherin]]\n}}\n{{Quote|My Uncle Alphard had left me a decent bit of gold \u2014 he's been wiped off here, too, that's probably why \u2014 anyway, after that I looked after myself.|[[Sirius Black]] regarding his uncle Alphard|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n\n'''Alphard Black''' (between [[1925]] and [[1938]]<ref name=\"birth\" /> \u2014 [[1976]]/[[1977]]<ref name=\"Bloomsbury\" />) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] from the noble [[House of Black]] and was a [[Slytherin]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].\n\n==Biography==\nAlphard was the middle child of [[Pollux Black]] and [[Irma Crabbe]], and brother of [[Walburga Black|Walburga]] and [[Cygnus Black III|Cygnus]]. He was born sometime after his sister and before his brother<ref name=\"BFT\" /> and grew up in [[12 Grimmauld Place]].<ref>Walburga's portrait states that 12 Grimmauld Place is \"The house of my fathers\" meaning that her father and his father in turn (and so on and so forth until the line met at Phineas Nigellus Black) owned it; this means that Alphard, like Walburga and Cygnus, would have grown up in the house.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alphard_2.jpg|thumb|left|Alphard was burnt off from the [[Black Family Tapestry|Black family tree tapestry]] after his disownment]]\nAlphard passed away from unknown causes sometime in [[1976]] or [[1977]]. In his will, he left a \"decent amount of gold\" to his nephew [[Sirius Black]], who was seventeen at the time.<ref name=\"Bloomsbury\" /> He was posthumously disowned and removed from the [[Black Family Tapestry|Black family tree tapestry]] by Sirius' mother, Walburga, and Sirius believed that this act of charity towards him was the reason why.<ref>{{OOTP}}, US hardback page 111</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nJudging from Alphard's action of helping his nephew when he ran away from home, it can be deduced that he was, at the very least, capable of love and fondness. It can therefore be inferred that he might have been kind and compassionate in his life, which made Alphard vastly different from his sister [[Walburga Black]] and his younger brother [[Cygnus Black III]] for that matter, in that he wasn't bothered about his nephew being a blood traitor. He did not seem to fear being blasted off the tapestry, thus indicating that, like his nephew, he himself had a rebellious or brave bone. He shared similarities with his niece [[Andromeda Tonks]] and his distant relative [[Cedrella Black]], in that they were all the middle child of three, sorted into Slytherin, and disowned.\n\n==Etymology==\nLike many members of the [[House of Black|Black family]], Alphard is named after a star. [[Wikipedia:Alphard|Alphard]] is the brightest star in the constellation Hydra, and is known as the heart of the serpent. Its name is derived from the Arabic \u0641\u0631\u062f|\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u062f (''Al Fard''), meaning \"the solitary one\".\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{OOTP}} {{1st Mention}}\n*{{OOTP|F}} {{Comment|Appears on Black family tree tapestry}}\n*{{OOTP|G}} {{Comment|Seen on [[House of Black|Black family]] tree tapestry}}\n*{{DH|G1}} {{Comment|Seen on [[House of Black|Black family]] tree tapestry}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Black, Alphard}}\n\n[[de:Alphard Black]]\n[[de2:Alphard Black]]\n[[fi:Alphard Musta]]\n[[fr:Alphard Black]]\n[[ru:\u0410\u043b\u044c\u0444\u0430\u0440\u0434 \u0411\u043b\u044d\u043a]]\n[[pl:Alfard Black]]\n[[ja:\u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30c9\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af]]\n[[Category:1970s deaths]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British individuals]]\n[[Category:Disowned members of the House of Black]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pure-bloods]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
