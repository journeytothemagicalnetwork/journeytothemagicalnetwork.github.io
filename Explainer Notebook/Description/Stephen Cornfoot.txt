[[1979]]-[[1980]]) was a [[pure-blood]]<ref name=\"blood\"/> [[wizardkind|wizard]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]].<ref name=\"PM\">{{PM}}</ref> He was in the same year as [[Harry Potter]] and was Sorted into either [[Hufflepuff]] or\u00a0[[Ravenclaw]] house.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Stephen\" is from the Greek name \u03a3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (''Stephanos'') meaning \"crown\". Saint Stephen was a deacon who was stoned to death, as told in Acts in the New Testament, and he is regarded as the first Christian martyr. Due to him, the name became common in the Christian world. It was popularised in England by the Normans.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Stephen Cornfoot is listed as a [[Ravenclaw]] on the list of students in a page of [[J. K. Rowling]]'s notes shown on {{HPM}}. However, as two listed Hufflepuffs ([[Anthony Goldstein]] and [[Michael Corner]]) had their houses changed to Ravenclaw in the novels as published, two of those listed as Ravenclaws must have been changed to Hufflepuff. Cornfoot may be one of those whose house was changed.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{HPM}} {{1st Mention}}\n*{{PM}} {{Mention}}\n*{{WW}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Cornfoot, Stephen}}\n\n[[de:Stephen Cornfoot]]\n[[fr:Stephen Cornfoot]]\n[[ru:\u0421\u0442\u0435\u0444\u0430\u043d \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0444\u0443\u0442]]\n[[pl:Stephen Cornfoot]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pure-bloods]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1991]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
