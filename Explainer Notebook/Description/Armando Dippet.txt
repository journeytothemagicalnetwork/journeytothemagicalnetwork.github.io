It was during his tenure that the [[Chamber of Secrets]] was first opened by [[Tom Riddle]] since its creation by [[Salazar Slytherin]] in around [[First millennium A.D.|A.D. 993]]. Unknowingly, Dippet was indirectly responsible for the end of the attacks by telling [[Tom Riddle|Riddle]] that the school would have to be [[Closure of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|closed]] if said attacks continued. Dippet was also responsible for the expulsion of [[Rubeus Hagrid]] after Riddle framed him with the attacks.\n\nDippet left office between March [[1965]] and March [[1971]]<ref name=\"dumbledoretakesover\">{{POA|B|18}} Remus Lupin - \"I was a very small boy when I received the bite...But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic.\" {{WW|remus-lupin}} - Lupin was attacked shortly before his fifth birthday (March 1965) and Headmaster Dumbledore comes to visit shortly before his eleventh birthday (March 1971) so Dumbledore succeeded Dippet as headmaster during this time.</ref> and was succeeded by Albus Dumbledore. He was a \"nearly bald and a somewhat feeble\" man in his elderly years and died in late [[1992]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nArmando Dippet was born in [[October]] [[1637]],<ref name=\"Birth\" /> and it is likely that he attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].

What he did after his graduation is unknown, although Armando Dippet seemed to have been held in high regard in his old age, since he was eventually chosen and offered the job of being Headmaster of Hogwarts, although it is unknown whether he ever took up a teaching post prior to this appointment.\n\n===As Headmaster of Hogwarts===\n====Early years====\n[[File:COS carrying Myrtle's body away.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Dippet watching Myrtle's body getting taken out of Hogwarts]]\nProfessor Dippet became [[Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the early [[20th century|twentieth century]]<ref name=\"TBB\">{{TBB|R|F}} - Albus Dumbledore's notes</ref>, at over 200 years old<ref name=\"Birth\" />.

If so, Dippet would have sent students home early in the following year and increased the security of Hogwarts in response to the threat from [[Gellert Grindelwald]].<ref>[http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/a/a2/Daily_Prophet_-_29_Nov_1926.png/revision/latest?cb=20161118013619|The Daily Prophet, 29 November 1926,] states that \"Headmaster calls for emergency meeting with worried parents\" and that he sent \"students home early\" in the same year. Dippet is the only known male headmaster between Black and Dumbledore, although there may be others.</ref>\n\n====Christmas pantomime====\n{{Quote|The night's entertainment concluded with a packed hospital wing...|[[Albus Dumbledore]]|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}\n\nDuring Dippet's tenure as Headmaster, [[Herbert Beery]], then-Herbology master, proposed an adaptation of ''[[The Fountain of Fair Fortune]]'' as a Christmas treat for both staff and students. The show, however, was a fiasco: the students [[Girl who played Amata|playing Amata]] and [[Boy who played Sir Luckless|Sir Luckless]] had been boyfriend and girlfriend until one hour before the show, at which point [[Boy who played Sir Luckless|\"Sir Luckless\"]] dumped her for [[Girl who played Asha|\"Asha\"]]. During the play, the [[Engorgement Charm|Engorged]] [[Ashwinder]] portraying the Worm (provided by the reckless Professor [[Silvanus Kettleburn]]) exploded in a shower of hot sparks and dust, filling the [[Great Hall]] with smoke and fragments of the scenery. While the Ashwinder's eggs set fire to the floorboards, [[Girl who played Amata|\"Amata\"]] and [[Girl who played Asha|\"Asha\"]] started [[duelling]] fiercely. [[Herbert Beery|Professor Beery]] was caught in the crossfire and his head assumed unusual proportions. While the staff evacuated the [[Great Hall]], the fire raging inside it threatened to engulf the place.<ref name=\"TBB\" />\n\nOf course, there were several people sent to the [[Hospital Wing]] and Professor Dippet had to put Professor Kettleburn in one of his sixty-two periods of [[probation]]. In response to this dramatic fiasco, Professor Dippet imposed a blanket ban on future pantomimes, a tradition that is still followed by the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]' staff and students to this day.<ref name=\"TBB\" />\n\n====Chamber of Secrets openings====\n{{Quote|My dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy\u2026 the death of that poor little girl. You will be safer by far at your orphanage.

We are no nearer locating the \u2014 er \u2014 source of all this unpleasantness\u2026|Dippet regarding the closing Hogwarts after the Chamber of Secrets is opened|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\n\nDippet was the [[Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] when the [[Chamber of Secrets]] was opened by [[Tom Riddle]], during the [[1942]]\u2014[[1943]] school year. Very fond of Riddle, Dippet was unaware of his sinister nature.<ref name=\"CS13\" />\n\nThat school year, many students were attacked by [[Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk]]. On [[13 June]] of the same year, a student named [[Myrtle Warren]] was murdered in a [[Second-floor girls' lavatory|bathroom]],<ref name=\"CS13\" /> during one of the Chamber's openings by [[Tom Riddle|Riddle]].<ref name=\"CS17\">{{COS|B|17}}</ref> After realising that no one had seen Myrtle for a couple of hours, Professor Dippet asked fellow student [[Olive Hornby]] to go and look for Myrtle.<ref name=\"GF25\">{{GOF|B|25}}</ref>\n\nMyrtle's [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Myrtle's father|father]] and [[Myrtle's mother|mother]] were summoned to the school by Dippet, and the Headmaster faced the possibility of closing the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|school]]. Dippet also rejected Tom's request of staying at school over the summer holidays due to the situation, but would have given him special permission if the school were much safer.<ref name=\"CS13\" /> Not wanting the school to close, or possibly not wanting to return to the orphanage, [[Tom Riddle|Riddle]] stopped attacking students with the [[Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk|Chamber's Basilisk]] and framed [[Rubeus Hagrid]] for the attacks, in which Dippet then promptly expelled Hagrid. Under [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s request, Hagrid was trained as [[Keeper of Keys and Grounds|Gamekeeper]] and was allowed to remain at the school.<ref name=\"CS17\" />\n\n====Exchange visit with Castelobruxo====\nDuring [[1940s]] or [[1950s]], [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] received students and Professor [[Benedita Dourado]] from [[Castelobruxo]], the [[Brazil]]ian [[wizarding school]], during an exchange visit. When Dippet complained of [[Peeves]], the resident [[poltergeist]], Professor Dourado laughed heartily and offered to send him some [[Caipora]] for the [[Forbidden Forest]] \"''to show you what trouble really is''\". Naturally, Professor Dippet did not take her up on that offer.<ref name=\"PM-castelobruxo\">{{WW|castelobruxo}}</ref>\n\n====Tom Riddle's job application====\n{{Quote|Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen, but invited him to reapply in a few years, if he still wished to teach...

Rowling Web Chat Transcript (30 July, 2007)] at The Leaky Cauldron</ref>), it can be reasonably assumed that it contains false defamatory information, or otherwise facts taken out of context.\n\nIn the [[1 September]] [[1992]] edition of the [[Evening Prophet]], he was being suspected of causing an accident only a month before his [[Ancient age flying test]] on his 355th birthday. Dippet died in late [[1992]].<ref name=\"DOD\" /> \n\nAfter his death,<ref name=\"DOD\" /> the late Headmaster was allowed to leave behind an imprint of himself in the form of a [[portrait]] mounted on the wall of the [[Headmaster's office]] along with other revered Headmasters and Headmistress.<ref name=\"OP37\">{{OOTP|B|37}}</ref> In doing this, he effectively ensured that he in some capacity could continue to posthumously serve the school by sharing his knowledge with his successors in office as a final service to his beloved school.\n\nThe portrait he left behind presents him as very dignified and solemn-looking while attired in long, majestic robes of blue and bronze.<ref name=\"CSf\">{{COS|F}}</ref> In [[1995]], he scorned the portrait of [[Phineas Nigellus Black]], who was feigning tiredness in order to avoid going to [[12 Grimmauld Place]] like Dumbledore asked him to. He was devoted to serving whoever was [[Headmaster]].<ref name=\"OP22\">{{OOTP|B|22}}</ref>\n\n==Physical description==\nProfessor Dippet had pale skin, brown eyes and, in his youth, a thick brown beard.<ref name=\"PAvg\" />\n\nIn his elderly years, he became frail and feeble-looking. He was balding and had only a few wisps of white hair left.<ref name=\"CS13\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAs made evident by his portrait in the Headmaster's Office, he was apparently a very proud man who for the most part held himself with dignity and solemnity at all but the most trying of times, in which case he would, over time, look very feeble and tired after having to cope with such troubles at his age. \n\nVery loyal to Hogwarts, Professor Dippet gave a certain impression of holding the school in higher regard than he did even his staff, as he was very distrusting of others, and Professor Albus Dumbledore, his Head of Transfiguration at during the later parts of Professor Dippet's tenure, noted that he was one of the few people that Professor Dippet confided in. He was also a man of tradition, having trained his portrait to scold anyone who showed lack of respect or loyalty to the school, which was shown when it reprimanded the portrait Phineas Nigellus's for attempting to defy a request from Professor Dumbledore, expressing that they were honour-bound to give advice to the current Headmaster or Headmistress, regardless of their personal feelings, showing that the living Professor Dippet had taught his portrait to share his unyielding desire to serve the school with professional integrity.\n\nDuring his time as Headmaster, Professor Dippet was apparently a disciplinarian. Perhaps somewhat harshly old-fashioned in his methods, the school was marked by an acceptance of severe punishment under his leadership, as he allowed the [[Hogwarts Caretaker|Caretaker]] of the day, Mr [[Apollyon Pringle]], to continue the traditionally accepted use of corporal punishment on students for misbehaviour or rule-breaking. However, he was not feared by his students, but was seen as revered and very capable in his own right, and ultimately a man dedicated to the protection and preservation of the school and all its inhabitants who also did not take the safety of his students lightly, and his success as head of the school is shown by his depiction on a Famous Witches and Wizards Card solely in homage to his long and faithful service to the school as Headmaster.\n\nProfessor Dippet was by no means above severely punishing anyone who might pose a potential breach in the security of the castle, be it student or staff: [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Horace Slughorn]] once commented, perhaps in jest, that Dippet would not hesitate to put him in detention if he found out that he had been [[Slug Club|encouraging students to be up and about past curfew]]. He also placed Professor [[Silvanus Kettleburn]], whom he always considered to be quite reckless, on no fewer than sixty-two periods of [[probation]] (including once after the chaos that ensued during a performance of ''[[The Fountain of Fair Fortune]]'', for which Kettleburn provided an [[Engorgement Charm|Engorged]] [[Ashwinder]] to play the part of the [[Gigantic white worm|Worm]]), since the catastrophe endangered the students.<ref name=\"TBB\"/>\n\nHis concern for the well-being of his students was shown once more during the 1942-1943 school year, when he, like all his employees, did everything in his power to apprehend the perpetrator and protect the students after the opening of [[Chamber of Secrets]]. During that year, it is known that he instructed a student by the name of [[Olive Hornby]] to go look for fellow student [[Myrtle Warren]] the moment he realised that no one had seen her for some time.<ref>{{GOF|B|25}}</ref>\n\nHe also seemed to favour status, at least to some extent. This is demonstrated by the fact that he was fully prepared to believe the word of a Prefect over the word of a younger student, and when Rubeus Hagrid were declared a suspect in the case of who opened the Chamber of Secrets, Dippet promptly expelled him without putting much effort in investigating the matter. However, as the school at the time was dangerously near to being closed down by the Ministry of Magic after the murder on Myrtle, he was likely to have done so on account of having been under a lot of pressure from parents.  \n\nAs Hagrid was allowed to stay after his expulsion, Professor Dippet might have been a wise, well-meaning if somewhat strict administrator under pressure rather than mercilessly expelling one student on the word of another. The fact that Hagrid's father passed away that year can also have been a factor in Professor Dippet permitting him to remain at Hogwarts, due to sympathising with the young boy's tragic situation and recognised his need for a home since there no longer was anyone to look after him, which proves that Professor Dippet, behind his solemn exterior, did indeed care about the students of Hogwarts, and was capable of looking past whatever wrongdoings one of the pupils was accused of and focus on their needs in times of great trouble and loss.\n\nIt is known that during his tenure at Hogwarts, Professor Dippet grew rather fond of [[Tom Riddle]] and was perhaps somewhat biased towards him, partly due to sympathising with the boy who had grown up orphaned and friendless and partly due to the young man's charisma. However, this did not blind him from keeping their safety his number one priority, nor did it stop him for keeping up certain standards. This is shown when he rejects the request of a recent graduate to become a teacher on the basis of being too young, as well as rejecting [[Tom Riddle]]'s request of staying at school over the summer holidays due to the situation while unaware that Riddle was the one behind the danger Dippet wanted to protect him from. However, being fully aware that Riddle despised the orphanage where he was raised, he did comment that he would have given him special permission if the school was more safer at the time.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Magic]]al aptitude''': As he became the [[Headmaster]] of Hogwarts, a highly prestigious and esteemed [[wizarding school]], Dippet was therefore a highly accomplished, powerful and experienced [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who would have possessed wide-reaching knowledge of and much proficiency in many different branches of magic. \n*'''Leadership skills''': While he never achieved the level of admiration and reverence of his immediate successor, Professor Dippet was nonetheless a very capable Headmaster of the school, and remembered as such by his tenure having been the theme of his [[Chocolate Frog Card]].\n\n==Possessions==\n*'''Wand''': Professor Dippet's wand was of unknown manufacturer, length, core and wood. He was in possession of it during the [[1940s]]. He left it on his desk during his meeting with [[Tom Riddle]] in [[1943]] concerning the summer holidays and the [[Chamber of Secrets]] openings.<ref name=\"CSgbc\">{{COS|G}} - GBC version</ref>\n*'''Headmaster's office''': When Professor Dippet presided in the [[headmaster's office|office]] in the [[Headmaster's Tower]], there was a single bookcase, a desk, and several paintings there, including the [[portrait]]s of his [[headmaster|predecessors]]. His passwords are unknown, though it can be presumed that he told one of them to [[Tom Riddle]] in [[1943]].<ref name=\"CS13\" />\n*'''Strawberry and ling plantations''': According to [[Albus Dumbledore]], Professor Dippet planted some [[strawberry|strawberries]] and [[Wikipedia:Calluna|ling]] in the castle grounds while he was Headmaster. However, it is likely that Albus was simply trying to distract [[Cornelius Fudge]] and [[Walden Macnair]].<ref name=\"PAf\">{{POA|F}}</ref>\n\n==Relationships==\n===Tom Riddle===\n{{Quote|I had advised Armando against the appointment \u2014 I did not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty...|Dippet's fondness of Riddle|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}Dippet was very fond of [[Tom Riddle]], whom he made several \"special arrangements\" for. His relationship with him was strong enough to make Dumbledore decide not to tell Dippet about why he thought Riddle should not be given a job at the school.<ref name=\"HBP20\" />\n\n===Hogwarts staff===\nProfessor Dippet was, apparently, distrusting of his employees, confiding only in a few [[professor]]s, which included the [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] teacher [[Albus Dumbledore]].<ref name=\"HBP20\" />\n\nAs headmaster, Dippet placed [[Silvanus Kettleburn]] on at least one, but presumably many more, of his sixty-two periods of probation. The one known time was after he provided an [[Ashwinder]] with an [[Engorgement Charm]] on it instead of a worm for the ''[[The Fountain of Fair Fortune]]'' pantomime. Dippet, after the chaos, placed a permanent ban on pantomimes from there on.<ref name=\"TBB\" />\n\nAnother of Dippet's employees was [[Herbert Beery]], who was the one who adapted ''[[The Fountain of Fair Fortune]]'' into a play. Beery, who had been teaching [[Herbology]], eventually left to become a [[professor]] of the [[Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts]].<ref name=\"TBB\" />\n\n[[Horace Slughorn]] also worked under Headmaster Dippet. One evening, during one of his [[Slug Club]]'s supper parties, Slughorn joked that if the student group would be found up and about after hours, Professor Dippet would put them all in detention, including himself.<ref name=\"HBPf\">{{HBP|F}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n*\"''Armando''\" is the Spanish and Italian variant of the name Armand, meaning \"of the army\". It is likely that, given his name, Armando Dippet is at least partially of Spanish or Italian heritage.\n*\"''Dippet''\" is not a word in English, but \"dip\" has many meanings, including: to put something into something else, often a liquid; to take something out of something, as in dipping out [[water]]; to lower and raise something; a fool.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*[[Alfred Burke]] appeared as Dippet in {{COS|FA}}, in the memory scene. His face can be glimpsed only for a fleeting moment, before he turns around and convenes with several other wizards. He is also not bald contrary to the book's description.\n[[File:Flying Ford Anglia Mystifies Muggles.png|250px|thumb|right|The newspaper mentioning Dippet]]\n*In {{COS|FA}}, Armando Dippet is mentioned in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' article ''[[Daily_Prophet_articles#FLYING_FORD_ANGLIA_MYSTIFIES_MUGGLES_.28Evening_Prophet.3B_1_September_1992.29|FLYING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES]]''. In the article, witches [[Leonora Gore]] and [[Daphne Mauboisan]] accuse Dippet, their neighbour, of causing the incident and not a flying car. Dippet is referred to as \"''a rather feeble old wizard''\", \"''well known for his erratic flying''\", and had [[Armando Dippet's broomstick|his broomstick]] confiscated pending an [[ancient age flying test]] (a past occurrence, comprising a broomstick crash against [[Felicitania Tugwood]], who fell off of her broom and into the [[River Mersey]], is also cited). However, this canonicity of this article is open to dispute as the article changes subjects part-way through and becomes gibberish.\n**If it is Headmaster Dippet mentioned in the article, he was the fourth-oldest known wizard, being born in 1637. The only known wizards older than him were [[Barry Winkle|Barry Wee Willie Winkle]] (b. [[1236]]) and [[Nicolas Flamel|Nicolas]] and [[Perenelle Flamel]] (b.
