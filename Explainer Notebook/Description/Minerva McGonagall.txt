Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.|McGonagall's sternness and belief in her field|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}\n'''Professor Minerva McGonagall''', {{OM|First}},<ref name=\"shortstories\">{{PP|H}}, Chapter 1 (''Minerva McGonagall'')</ref> was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[half-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], the only daughter of [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Robert McGonagall Senior|Robert McGonagall]] and witch [[Isobel Ross]]. She also was the older sister of [[Malcolm McGonagall|Malcolm]] and [[Robert McGonagall Junior|Robert Jnr]]. Minerva attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was Sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]], but it took the Sorting Hat five and a half minutes to decide if she was Gryffindor or [[Ravenclaw]], which made her a [[Hatstall]]. During her seventh year, she was appointed [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Girl]].   \n\nAfter her education, Minerva worked for two years at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and later returned to Hogwarts, where she became [[Head of Gryffindor House]] and the [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] [[professor]]. Though she wasn't a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] during the [[First Wizarding War]], Minerva greatly helped the Ministry of Magic's resistance through spying on [[Death Eaters]] and bringing the [[Auror]]s crucial information on their activities. \n\nEventually, Minerva became concurrently, at differing times, [[Deputy Headmaster|Deputy Headmistress]] and [[Hogwarts Headmaster|Headmistress of Hogwarts]]. In [[1995]], she opposed [[Dolores Umbridge]], the [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor|High Inquisitor of Hogwarts]]. She also protected the students from [[Alecto Carrow|Alecto]] and [[Amycus Carrow]] from 1997 until 1998. As part of the Order of Phoenix's new resistance movement, Minerva fought in several battles of both wars, including the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], where she led the resistance against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]].\n\nMinerva survived the [[Second Wizarding War]] and continued her job as Headmistress, a title she still held as of [[Albus Potter]]'s time at Hogwarts.<ref name=\"CC41\" />\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nMinerva McGonagall was born on [[4 October]] to [[Robert McGonagall Senior|Robert McGonagall]], a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister, and his wife [[Isobel Ross]], a [[Wizardkind|witch]]. She was the couple's first child and was named after [[Minerva|her mother's grandmother]], a very powerful witch. By then, her parents lived on the outskirts of [[Caithness]] in the [[Scotland|Scottish Highlands]], in a village where mostly Muggles lived.<ref name=\"pottermorebio\" />\n\nHer birth proved both a joy and a crisis: Isobel had given up the use of her [[magic]] for her love of Robert and never told him about her [[Wizardkind|nature]] as she was afraid to mar the bliss of their wedding. However, the infant Minerva displayed small but noticeable signs of magic from her earliest hours. She had [[Underage magic|no control of her magic]] and thus inadvertently [[Summoning Charm|summoned]] toys that had been left on upper shelves to her cot, made the [[McGonagalls' cat|family cat]] do her bidding, and her[[Robert McGonagall Snr's bagpipes| father's bagpipes]] play themselves which would cause her to chuckle happily. Thus, Isobel often secluded herself with Minerva for days at a time. She knew she must confess to her husband about their daughter's [[wizardkind|wizarding abilities]] and so she finally did, explaining everything to Robert and telling him that they were bound by the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|International Statute of Secrecy]] and that they must conceal the truth about their magical abilities for their safety.<ref name=\"pottermorebio\" />\n\nThe two parents remained together despite the shocking revelation, but their trust never was the same, much to the sadness of their perceptive daughter. She later had two brothers, [[Malcolm McGonagall|Malcolm]] and [[Robert McGonagall Junior|Robert Jnr]], who revealed magical ability in due course. As a child, Minerva helped her mother conceal from her father the accidents and embarrassments the young witch's magic sometimes caused. She was very close to her Muggle father, whom in temperament she resembled more than her mother.<ref name=\"pottermorebio\" />\n\nOn Minerva's eleventh birthday, Minerva received her [[Hogwarts acceptance letter|admittance letter]] from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], at the time [[Headmaster|headed]] by [[Professor]] [[Armando Dippet]]. Before coming to the school, she visited [[Diagon Alley]] and purchased her wand from [[Ollivanders|Ollivander's]] Wand Shop. The [[Minerva McGonagall's wand|wand]] she selected was an unusual specimen, 9 and a half inches, [[fir]] and [[dragon heartstring]]. Now free to be with her kind and to exercise her talents, Minerva saw how her mother sobbed that day, not only out of pride, but also out of envy.<ref name=\"pottermorebio\" />\n\n===Hogwarts years===\nAt the age of eleven, Minerva attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. During her [[Sorting ceremony|Sorting]], she proved to be a [[hatstall]]: the [[Sorting Hat]] spent five-and-a-half minutes wavering between [[Gryffindor]] and [[Ravenclaw]] before deciding to place her in the former. Minerva's school career overlapped by two years with that of [[Pomona Sprout]], and the two students enjoyed an excellent relationship, both then and in later years.<ref name=\"pottermorebio\" />\n\nMinerva was quickly recognised as the most outstanding student of her year with a particular talent for [[Transfiguration]]. By the end of her education at Hogwarts, she had achieved an impressive record: top grades in [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] and [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.s]], [[Prefect]], [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Girl]], and winner of the ''[[Transfiguration Today Most Promising Newcomer award]]''. Under the guidance of her inspirational Transfiguration teacher, [[Albus Dumbledore]], Minerva had managed to become an [[Animagus]]; her animal form, with its distinctive markings (tabby cat, square spectacles markings around eyes) were duly logged in the Ministry of Magic's [[Animagus Registry]].<ref name=\"pottermorebio\" />\n\nMinerva played for [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] in her student years, in which she proved to be gifted. However, she suffered a nasty fall in her final year: a foul during the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|Gryffindor]] versus [[Slytherin Quidditch team|Slytherin]] [[Minerva McGonagall's last Gryffindor vs Slytherin Quidditch match|match]] which would decide the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]] winner. This event left her with a concussion, several broken ribs, and a lifelong desire to see Slytherin crushed on the Quidditch pitch.<ref name=\"pottermorebio\" />\n\n===Early heartbreak===\n[[File:YoungMcGonagall.jpg|235x235px|thumb|left|[[A Young Professor McGonagall|A younger Minerva McGonagall]]]]\nAfter graduating from Hogwarts, Minerva was offered a position at the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] of the British [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. She returned to her [[McGonagall manse|family's manse]] to spend one last summer with her family before moving to [[London]]. During these months an eighteen-years old Minerva met [[Dougal McGregor]], a local [[Non-magic people|Muggle]], who was the handsome, clever, and funny son of a [[Dougal McGregor's father|local farmer]]. The two shared a sense of humour, argued fiercely, and suspected mysterious depths in each other. Minerva fell head-over-heels in [[love]] with McGregor, being the first and only time in her life that she might have been said to lose her head. Eventually, McGregor proposed to Minerva on a ploughed field and she accepted his offer.<ref name=\"pottermorebio\" />\n\nThat night, however, Minerva was unable to tell her parents of her engagement. Thinking about her future, she realised that wedding a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] who didn't know that she was a witch would mean Minerva would follow her mother's footsteps and live unhappily with her wand locked away, shredding all of her ambitions. Early next morning, Minerva went to tell McGregor she had changed her mind and could not [[Marriage|marry]] him, aware that if she broke the International Statute of Secrecy and told him why, she would lose the job at the Ministry for which she was giving him up. She could give him no good reason for her change of heart, leaving McGregor devastated and left for [[London]] three days later. These months were to prove some of the most difficult of Minerva\u2019s life.<ref name=\"pottermorebio\" />\n\n===Employment===\nThough her feelings for the [[Ministry of Magic]] were affected by the fact that she had recently suffered an emotional crisis, Minerva didn't much enjoy her home in London and workplace, where some of her co-workers had an ingrained anti-Muggle bias. Given her adoration of her Muggle father and continuing love for Dougal, she deplored these ideas. Despite this, Minerva was among the most efficient, gifted employees in the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] and became fond of her much older boss, [[Elphinstone Urquart]]. After two years at the Ministry, she was offered a prestigious promotion, yet found herself turning it down as she missed her home in [[Scotland]].<ref name=\"pottermorebio\" />\n\n[[File:YoungMinerva.png|250px|thumb|Minerva in her earlier years as a [[Professor]]]]\nInstead, Minerva sent an owl to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], asking whether she might be considered for a teaching post. The owl returned within hours, offering her a job in the Transfiguration department, under Head of Department, Albus Dumbledore. Through her efforts and work, Minerva proved to be a inspirational yet strict teacher, maintaining control of her students with a stern hand that made her someone not to be crossed.<ref name=\"pottermorebio\" />\n\nBy this time, Minerva was shocked to learn from her oblivious mother (in the middle of a chatty letter of local news) that Dougal had married the daughter of another farmer. Albus discovered his former student and colleague in tears in her classroom late that evening, and she confessed the whole story to him. He offered both comfort and told Minerva some of his own family history, previously unknown to her. The confidences exchanged that night between were to form the basis of a lasting friendship.<ref name=\"pottermorebio\" />\n\nAmong her first students were [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] and [[Leta Lestrange]], the latter of whom was frequently in trouble with Minerva for retaliating to vicious gossip about her [[Corvus Lestrange (V)|half-brother]]'s death. A notable example of this is when Leta hexed a fellow student with the dark charm ''[[Oscausi]]'' during her third year, after the other girl had been speaking ill of Leta behind her back. Minerva was called upon to fix the situation, but Leta ran from her and Minerva was forced to chase her around the school, all the while docking points (Minerva ended up docking a total of 200 points). When she couldn't find Leta, Minerva removed the spell from the girl but promptly restored it with an irritated \"Whisht!\" when the girl continued to badmouth Leta.<ref name=\"COGS\" />\n\nDuring Gellert Grindelwald's rise, Minerva still taught at Hogwarts and was a close confidant to Dumbledore. She was quite critical of the [[Ministry of Magic]]'s involvement at Hogwarts and was furious when [[Torquil Travers]] and a team of [[Auror]]s interrupted Dumbledore's [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] lesson, protesting that this was \"a school.\" However, her protests fell on deaf ears and she was forced to escort the students from the [[Classroom 3C|classroom]].<ref name=\"COGS\" />\n\nThrough her early years at Hogwarts, Minerva remained close friends with her former boss in the Ministry, Elphinstone. During one visit, he proposed marriage to Minerva at [[Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop]]. Surprised, embarrassed, and still in love with Dougal, she declined. However, the two still remained in contact for years.<ref name=\"pottermorebio\" />\n\nLater on in her career, Minerva rose to the position of [[Head of Transfiguration|Head]] of the [[Transfiguration department]]. Her lessons consisted of but were not limited to [[Match to needle spell|match to needle]], [[Vera Verto|animal to water goblet]], [[Beetle into Button|beetle to button]], and [[Mice to Snuffboxes|mouse to snuffbox]] transformations, as well as [[Switching Spell]]s, [[Vanishing Spell|Vanishing]], and [[Conjuration|Conjuring]]. Furthermore, Minerva was appointed the position of [[Head of Gryffindor House]], the house in which she used to reside whilst studying at Hogwarts. After he became Headmaster, Dumbledore would later on in his career also trust her enough to allow her to become [[Deputy Headmaster|Deputy Headmistress]] of the school and fill in for him on the occasions of his absence.<ref name=\"pottermorebio\" />\n\n===First Wizarding War {{c|1970\u20131981}}===\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Minerva McGonagall|Oh yes, everyone\u2019s celebrating, all right.

Previously, she was suspicious of Riddle in spite of the fact that she wasn't his teacher and thus shared her fears with Dumbledore in private. Even so, McGonagall chose to not join the [[Order of the Phoenix]], which was seen as a renegade outfit by the Ministry at the time. Instead, unbeknownst to her students, she spent many nights spying for them in the guise of a tabby cat, bringing the [[Auror]]s crucial information on the activities of Voldemort's followers.<ref name=\"shortstories\" />\n[[File:Lily_Sorted.png|thumb|Minerva placing the [[Sorting Hat]] on Lily Evans]]\nDespite her involvement in the Ministry's efforts to contain the threat of the Dark Lord's rise to power, Minerva got through the war unscathed. However, she suffered personal bereavements: the loss of her brother [[Robert McGonagall Junior|Robert]]; of two of her favourite students, [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]] and [[James Potter I|James Potter]]; and of [[Dougal McGregor]], who was murdered in a random anti-Muggle attack by the Death Eaters, along with [[Dougal McGregor's wife|his wife]] and [[Dougal McGregor's children|children]]. This last news was a terrible blow to Minerva, who wondered if she would have been able to save him if she had married him.<ref name=\"shortstories\" />\n\nConcurrently, as the war raged outside the castle walls, the school was plagued by a series of [[curse]]s inadvertently unleashed by one of the students, [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]], who began to meddle with the five fabled [[Cursed Vaults]]. Like the rest of the faculty, Professor McGonagall did everything she could to protect the students, although they were ultimately unable to prevent the injury of several students and the death of a [[Slytherin]] student named [[Duncan Ashe]]; this all led to Jacob's [[Discipline at Hogwarts#Expulsion|expulsion]].\n\n====Protection of Harry Potter====\n{{Quote|These people will never understand him!

The defeat of Voldemort ultimately ended the war and his followers were arrested and those that escaped went into hiding.\n\nMinerva travelled to [[Surrey]] and there spent an entire day observing the [[Dursley family]] seeing whether or not they met the standards of looking after Harry as they were his only living relatives with his parents now dead. What she saw horrified her; the Dursleys couldn't have been any less like Lily and James if they had tried. She was thus present, along with [[Rubeus Hagrid]], when [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] placed Harry on the Dursleys' doorstep, despite her objections to leaving him with these [[Non-magic people|Muggles]], whom she considered to be the \"worst kind\" of them. She kept a close eye on Harry from time to time during his early childhood, as did the members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]].<ref name=\"PS\">{{PS}}</ref>\n\n===Between the wars {{c|1981\u20131995}}===\n[[File:Transfiguration class1.gif|241x241px|thumb|McGonagall teaching a second year Transfiguration class]]\nAfter the [[First Wizarding War]] had ended, Minerva continued on with her career at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], carrying on teaching the art of Transfiguration. Elphinstone, who had never ceased to love her, proposed every now and then until she finally accepted after Dougal's death. Their engagement happened during a summertime stroll around the lake in the Hogwarts grounds. The retired Elphinstone bought a small cottage for the two of them in Hogsmeade, whence Minerva could travel easily to work every day. Although the couple had no children, her nieces and nephews visited often. This was a period of great fulfilment for Minerva.\n\nIn 1985, three years into their marriage, Elphinstone died from a [[Venomous Tentacula]] bite.<ref name=\"pottermorebio\" /> Minerva, who couldn't bear to remain alone in their cottage, packed her things after her husband's funeral and returned to her first-floor study in Hogwarts Castle. It is unknown whether she still owns the cottage. Always a brave and private person, Minerva poured all her energies into her work and few people \u2013 excepting perhaps Albus \u2013 ever realised how much she suffered.\n\nDuring the second year of [[Jacob's sibling]], when [[Ben Copper]] when missing, they asked Minerva about it as she was the [[Head of House|Head of the Gryffindor House]]. She first asked if Jacob's sibling had seen him in the Hogwarts Express and if he had been acting strange and after learning that they didn't but [[Penny Haywood]] did and Ben seemed fine even though he was always a bit odd. She mentioned that the [[Cursed ice]] may have changed Ben and slightly chastised Jacob's sibling for their attempt to enter the [[Cursed Vaults|Cursed Vault]], asking them if they had learnt anything that said of a threat beyond the door and appealed to them that this involved all of Hogwarts, not just Jacob. Learning that they had found and read a message about an [[Ice Knight]] and [[Vanished Stairs]], Minerva said she will discuss this with Dumbledore and accidentally revealed that she and the other teachers had once dealt with the Cursed Ice, which she quickly covered by telling Jacob's sibling that he is free to help in the search of Ben and ask for him to tell her personally should he succeed, promising to reward him.<ref name=\"HM21\">{{HM|2|1}}</ref>\n\nMcGonagall and Snape eventually found the missing Ben Copper encased in Cursed ice and Jacob's Sibling and Rowan realised she knew more about the Cursed Ice than she revealed. Minerva was perplexed that the [[Knockback Jinx]] had no effect on the ice, noting on how they once could use it to shatter the ice, and even more so when Snape callously suggested they use [[Fire-Making Spell|Incendio]] to melt the ice while also burning him to death, as she realised from how the Cursed Ice had began to expand throughout the school that someone had been tampering with the Vaults. Ignoring Snape's frustrated questioning of Dumbledore's whereabouts, Minerva and Snape used the [[Fire-Making Spell]] to successfully free Ben from the Cursed Ice, taking care to target as further as possible from his body.<ref name=\"HM23\">{{HM|2|3}}</ref>\n\nKnowing Minerva was the only one left in the school with Dumbledore gone that could possibly teach them the [[Revelio Charm]], Jacob's sibling turned to her to learn the spell. At first Minerva was baffled due to how advanced the charm was but ultimately agreed to teach them if they proved themselves sufficiently adept, impressed by their desire to help Hogwarts and study Transfiguration. Finding their abilities to have reached the level required in the class, Minerva called them to have their private lesson and after Jacob's sibling successfully learned Revelio, Minerva congratulated them and noted the usefulness of the spell.<ref name=\"HM24pt\" />\n\nAfter learning that [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] had taught Jacob's sibling the Fire-Making Spell, Minerva was furious and scolded him heavily.<ref name=\"HM210\">{{HM|2|10}}</ref>\n\n====Protecting the Philosopher's Stone====\n{{Quote|Welcome to Hogwarts. The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be Sorted into your houses.|Minerva McGonagall introducing the first-year students of [[1991]] to Hogwarts|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}\n[[File:McGonagall students.jpg|245px|thumb|left|McGonagall welcomes first year students to Hogwarts]]\nIn 1991 friend of [[Albus Dumbledore]], [[Nicolas Flamel]], had the [[Philosopher's Stone]] that was keeping him alive moved from his safe in [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]] to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] for safe keeping. Minerva contributed to the defences set up around the magical artefact by transfiguring an enormous [[Chessboard Chamber|chess set]] and [[Piertotum Locomotor|animating]] it to behave as a normal Wizard's chess set would. As part of its protection duty, it required that the person or persons seeking to get past would have to take the place of a piece on the board and play an actual game of wizard's chess, at great physical risk to themselves. This larger than life version of [[Wizard's Chess]] is known to be brutally violent and sacrificial for wizards to have to take part in themselves.<ref name=\"PS\" />\n\n[[File:Harry-potter1-minerva_sorting.jpg|250px|thumb|Minerva directing students during the [[Sorting ceremony]]]]\nAlso in this year, [[Harry Potter]], whom Minerva had been watching over for many years, would start his first year of education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], not knowing this, as he did not know that he was a wizard. Once Harry eventually arrived at Hogwarts, after the delivery of many acceptance letters, Harry was Sorted into the house of [[Gryffindor]] which Minerva was head of. Harry was therefore again placed under the watchful eye and care of McGonagall.<ref name=\"PS\" />\n\nThough Minerva often maintained her strict persona in regards to the boy, she wasn't above bending the rules for him on occasion, such as when she caught him flying on a broomstick without proper supervision. Instead of expelling him, which was Madam Hooch's stated punishment for anyone caught doing so, Minerva instead took him to see [[Oliver Wood]], captain of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], to comment on his prodigious skill with the broom. Harry made the team, remarkable for a first year, and became the youngest [[Seeker]] in a century. She made arrangements for Harry to have a [[Nimbus 2000]], the fastest broomstick of the time, for use during games and practices. However, several incidents marred the year.<ref name=\"PS\" />\n\n[[File:Harry-potter1-mcgonagall classroom.jpg|250px|thumb|left|McGonagall chastising Harry and Ron for being late to class]]\nAt Hallowe'en, the festive feast was interrupted by the arrival of Professor Quirrell, who came charging in screaming about a troll loose in the dungeons before fainting dead away. After restoring calm, Dumbledore ordered all students to return to their dormitories while he and the teachers made their way to the dungeons. The troll was not there upon their entry, but a terrible racket from an upper floor provided a clue. Upon reaching the site, Minerva was shocked to discover a wrecked bathroom, an unconscious troll and three bedraggled first years, one of whom was her best student Hermione Granger. To her further shock, Hermione claimed that she had gone looking for the troll thinking she could handle it but would most assuredly have been killed had Harry and Ron not found her. Torn between anger and pride, Minerva took five points from Hermione but awarded five each to Harry and Ron for, as she put it, \"sheer dumb luck.\" Over the Christmas period, she attended the Christmas feast and received a kiss on the cheek from a very drunk Hagrid; rather than admonish him, she instead giggled while blushing red in the face.<ref name=\"PS\" />\n\n[[File:Transfiguration homework.jpg|250px|thumb|McGonagall being informed of the trio's suspicions someone was going to steal the Stone]]\nHowever, her serious side appeared one night when she caught Draco Malfoy roaming the school at night. Dragging him by the ear, she sentenced him to detention and deducted twenty points from Slytherin when he claimed that Harry was also out of bed with an illegal baby dragon. Though the dragon in question was successfully released, Harry, Hermione and Neville were all caught and brought before McGonagall by Filch. Mad and disappointed with them, she told them all off before punishing them severely; a loss of fifty points each, 150 in total, and detention with Malfoy. This caused Gryffindor to drop to last in the House Cup.<ref name=\"PS\" />\n\nTowards the end of the year, McGonagall and the other teachers' protective enchantments down in the [[Underground Chambers|Philosopher's Stone chambers]] would come to test when [[Quirinus Quirrell|Quirrell]] attempted to steal the Philosopher's Stone. Also testing and facing the enchantments were [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. The trio was successful in stopping the stone being stolen and at the end of the school year, Gryffindor had won the house cup after receiving the most house points that year after getting bonus points for the trio's and [[Neville Longbottom]]'s bravery. Thus, for the first time in years, McGonagall's house was the current house cup champions. Her reaction wasn't documented, but it's assumed that she was pleased with their efforts as Professor Snape shook her hand with a very forced look of congratulations.<ref name=\"PS\" />\n\n====The second opening of the Chamber of Secrets====\n{{Dialogue a-b|McGonagall|What does this ''mean'', Albus?|Albus Dumbledore|It means that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again.|The opening of the Chamber is confirmed after finding Colin Creevey petrified|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}In the beginning of the 1992 school term, Minerva had to deal with Harry and Ron, who crashed Mr Weasley's [[Flying Ford Anglia]] into the [[Whomping Willow]], due to the barrier to [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters]] being sealed by [[Dobby]] so the two couldn't board the train. This nearly exposed the wizarding world to Muggles, but Minerva was fairer than Snape, the one who brought the matter up in the first place. Minerva ultimately let them off with a mere detention and letters to their families. Also she didn't take any house points as Harry pointed out that term had not started yet when they took the car, which she confirmed and almost smiled at this remark.<ref name=\"COS\" />\n\n[[File:Harry-potter2-professors.jpg|250px|thumb|left|McGonagall and other members of staff discover the declaration]]\nLater, Minerva was present for the re-opening of the [[Chamber of Secrets]]. She, along with the rest of the teaching staff, scoured the castle for the Chamber, but to no avail. Minerva was worried over the messages left on the walls and was at a loss about what should be done. She also had to deal with the less than helpful [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], who had been hired for the position of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] Professor. McGonagall had little liking or use for the man and by the end of the year was only one of the many staff members who utterly despised him. For example when he decorated the Great Hall in nauseatingly lurid pink hearts for Valentine's Day, she was observed to have a muscle twitching noticeably in her face. Throughout the year, two of Minerva's students, Hermione Granger and Colin Creevey were Petrified along with the House ghost Nearly Headless Nick.<ref name=\"COS\" />\n\nIn the final weeks of that school year, Minerva served as temporary [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] of Hogwarts after the Board of Governors, under Lucius Malfoy's influence, suspended Dumbledore for failing to stop the attacks against the students. She was also quite shaken and softened up, as when Harry and Ron tried to sneak off to investigate the matter but were caught by herself. She let them off under the belief that they were trying to visit a [[Petrification|petrified]] Hermione, though she normally would punish them with detention.<ref name=\"COS\">{{COS}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|All students to return to their House dormitories at once.

Her temperament was not improved by the arrival of the hated Gilderoy Lockhart, who was completely oblivious to the worry of his fellow staff members, and immediately joined Professors Snape, Flitwick and Sprout in forcing him into a corner by recalling all of his boasts that he could deal with the monster easily. With him dealt with, as they couldn't care less if he succeeded or failed, the staff turned their attention to the thing they never thought would happen; the permanent closure of Hogwarts.<ref name=\"COS\" />\n\n[[File:Harry-potter2-minera_leaving_feast.jpg|250px|thumb|left|McGonagall at the End-of-Term Feast celebrating the end of the [[Chamber of Secrets]]]]\nThankfully, this terrible reality never came to pass.

Harry then explained that he and Ron had gone into the Chamber to find Ginny, having realised the mystery, and had slain the [[Serpent of Slytherin|monster]] within.

When the school year began in September, Minerva had to deal with the effects that the Dementors had on her students, such as Harry Potter. She also authorised [[Hermione Granger]] to use a [[Time-Turner]] in order to take extra classes, a decision that would prove more useful in future events that year. This year at Hogwarts would prove to be another difficult year with Dementors guarding the castle, though they were forbidden from entering the grounds properly by Dumbledore. Minerva heartily approved of this, as she despised the foul creatures.<ref name=\"POA\" />\n\nAt the start of the year, when McGonagall demonstrated her [[Animagus]] form to her first class, she notes how quiet they were, as every class she demonstrated it to prior clapped. When Hermione explained about their first [[Divination]], McGonagall understood and asked her class which of them would be dying this year. Harry Potter raised his hand. McGonagall assured him that [[Sybill Trelawney]]'s predictions were a way of greeting her class and that no deaths of any students have occurred yet. To further put him at ease, she demonstrated one of her rare glimmerings of humour by stating that she still expected him to do his homework, but if he did die then she would excuse his not handing it in.<ref name=\"POA\" />\n\n[[File:Gryffindor common room 1993.jpg|250px|thumb|Professor McGonagall and the residents of Gryffindor Tower in the common room after Sirius Black's break-in]]\nThroughout the year, Minerva assisted in guarding the school, yet nonetheless Black was able to infiltrate the castle. After Black had attacked the [[Fat Lady]], McGonagall tried to tell Harry that Black was after him, but was cut off by Harry, who told her that Mr Weasley had told him, before she could explain. Later in the year, Minerva was summoned to [[Gryffindor Tower]] when Ron Weasley claimed to have been attacked by Black. She initially dismissed him as Black could not have possibly got in without the password (unaware that Hermione's cat, [[Crookshanks]], befriended by Sirius and gave him a discarded list of passwords) but was rendered speechless when the new guardian, Sir [[Cadogan]], confirmed that he had indeed let him in because he had the passwords written down. When [[Neville Longbottom]] admitted to having written the passwords down, McGonagall banned him from future Hogsmeade visits for the rest of the year, gave him a detention, forbade anyone to give him the password into Gryffindor Tower and wrote to his grandmother. As a result, Neville received a [[Howler]] from her during breakfast.<ref name=\"POA\" />\n\n[[File:Christmas Firebolt minerva.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry receives a Firebolt for Christmas that is soon confiscated by McGonagall]]\nWhen Harry received a [[Harry Potter's Firebolt|Firebolt]] following the destruction of his Nimbus 2000, McGonagall had it confiscated to be \"examined\" because she believed it to have been sent by Black (and correctly so), and therefore lethally cursed (which was incorrect). This incident caused Harry and Hermione to have a row, because Hermione had alerted Minerva about the Firebolt. It was returned to him later after having been declared safe. During the Quidditch match against Ravenclaw, Draco Malfoy, Gregory Goyle, Vincent Crabbe, and Marcus Flint posed as [[Dementor]]s to sabotage Harry's performance, only to get struck down when Harry reflexively cast a Patronus Charm at them. Utterly furious at this downright trickery, she deducted fifty points from Slytherin and put the quartet in detention.<ref name=\"POA\" />\n\n[[File:Harry Potter Pottermore Harry Holding Quidditch Cup In A Crowd Moment.jpg|250px|thumb|Gryffindor wins the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]] in 1994]]\nIn the spring of 1994, though disgusted by the Slytherin Quidditch team's dirty tactics during the final Quidditch match after witnessing [[Draco Malfoy]] grab onto the end of Harry's Firebolt to stop him from catching the [[Golden Snitch]] (which infuriated her to the point where she stopped telling Lee Jordan off and actually joined him in firing furious comments at Malfoy), she witnessed the Gryffindor Quidditch team win the Quidditch Cup for the first time since [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]] had played for the team during his Hogwarts education. McGonagall was delighted by Gryffindor's victory, openly sobbing &mdash; even louder than the already sobbing Oliver Wood \u2014 into a Gryffindor Flag, but was upset to see [[Oliver Wood]] leaving.

[[Harry Potter]] was selected as a Triwizard Champion, despite being under age and McGonagall worried for his safety after having looked after him for so many years. Minerva pleaded with Dumbledore and Crouch to withdraw Harry from the tournament, as the tournament was highly dangerous. But withdrawing would go against the rules of the tournament and Potter had to continue on, as there was a [[binding magical contract]] in place.<ref name=\"GOF\" />\n\n[[File:Harry-potter4 minerva yule ball.jpg|250px|thumb|left|McGonagall attending the Yule Ball and dancing with Dumbledore]]\nDuring the year Minerva more than once exhorted her students to provide a good appearance to their guests at the castle. She attended the [[Yule Ball]] with Albus Dumbledore and notably wore her hair down for the first time since Harry started his education at Hogwarts. While at the Ball, Minerva danced with both [[Ludovic Bagman]] and Dumbledore, among others. In the case of the former, Harry Potter noticed Bagman kiss Minerva's hand once they had finished dancing.<ref name=\"GOF\" />\n\nMinerva loaned [[Classroom 1B|her classroom]] to Harry, Ron and Hermione so they could practise spells for Harry's preparation for the Third Task. She did this after having walked in on them practising so many times around the school. At the end of the Tournament, Minerva accompanied Dumbledore and [[Severus Snape]] in the rescue of Harry Potter from the [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Death Eater]] that had spent the entire school year impersonating the [[Auror]] [[Alastor Moody]], that year's [[Defence Against the Dark Arts|DADA]] professor.<ref name=\"GOF\" />\n\n[[File:B4C36M1 Snape Dark Mark reveal.png|250x250px|thumb|McGonagall is present while Snape presents his newly activated Dark Mark]]\n\nShe was instructed to guard Crouch Jnr after he revealed his part in the rebirth of Voldemort but was unable to prevent the Dementor brought by [[Minister for Magic|Minister]] [[Cornelius Fudge]] from giving the Death Eater the [[Dementor's Kiss]]. She was intensely furious at Fudge for this blunder, and severely shaken from having witnessed the unspeakably horrible act, screaming more than Harry had ever seen before. Thus, when the Minister refused to believe Dumbledore and Harry Potter about the return of Voldemort, Minerva nonetheless stood in support of her superior and her student. In the return of the Dark Lord, [[Hufflepuff]] student [[Cedric Diggory]] was carelessly murdered and a [[Memorial feast to Cedric Diggory|memorial feast]] was held at the end of the school year.

She would come and go from [[12 Grimmauld Place]] wearing a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] dress rather than her robes, which Harry thought made her look odd. Though these duties took up much of her time, Minerva would face even greater challenges at Hogwarts. Because Dumbledore was unable to find a new professor for Defence Against the Dark Arts, the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] appointed [[Dolores Umbridge]], a senior Ministry official and stout supporter of Fudge, to the Hogwarts staff. Minerva saw this appointment as an affront to the school itself and did little to hide her disgust.<ref name=\"OOTP\">{{OOTP}}</ref>\n\n====High Inquisitor at Hogwarts====\n{{Quote|I wonder how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me?

McGonagall did all she could to circumvent Umbridge's authority without risking her own security as Deputy Headmistress. Indeed, she treated Umbridge with as little credence and respect as possible while Hogwarts was under investigation by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and even gave [[Peeves]] tips on how to unscrew a chandelier when he was trying to cause havoc for Umbridge. McGonagall also managed to put aside her dislike of [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] for a time in the face of Umbridge's persecution of Hogwarts' inhabitants. It is shown she brings Trelawney back to Hogwarts after Umbridge dismissed her.<ref name=\"OOTP\" />\n\nAfter Umbridge's appointment as [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor|High Inquisitor]], Minerva was forced to endure the other woman's presence during her evaluation of Minerva's teaching.

After Harry's resistance group was discovered by Umbridge, Minerva was present in Dumbledore's office when Harry was brought in. When Umbridge revealed that anti-Muggle prankster [[Willy Widdershins]] had provided her with testimony that Harry was forming this rebel group, Minerva loudly voiced that she had wondered why he had managed to avoid prosecution for all his regurgitating toilet charges, joined in her vocal outrage by the portrait of Headmaster [[Dexter Fortescue]].<ref name=\"OOTP\" />\n\nDumbledore managed to save Harry by taking credit for the student organisation, which led to Fudge announcing his intention to arrest him and actually attempted to have him taken by force, sneering at the idea of Dumbledore taking on him and the others single-handed.

She only stood down on Dumbledore's direct orders, as Hogwarts would need her.<ref name=\"OOTP\" />\n\nAfter Dumbledore escaped arrest, Umbridge was appointed Headmistress over Minerva, but had virtually no support. When Umbridge invaded the career advising of the 5th-year students, Minerva finally lost her temper. During Harry Potter's session, when Umbridge kept interrupting the conversation and declaring that Harry would never be an [[Auror]] at the Ministry, Minerva declared to Harry that she would help him in any way necessary to achieve his goal, even if it was the last thing she ever did.

Amycus then revealed that they had been warned that Harry might try to get into Ravenclaw Tower, to which Minerva responded with confusion as Harry was in her house, speaking of this with pride in her voice, before scanning the room. Amycus then horrified her by stating his plan to push the blame for Alecto summoning Voldemort on the children in the dormitories, without remorse or concern that they would likely be killed or horribly tortured. Minerva refused to allow it, prompting the Death Eater to spit in her face, only to be flung across the room with the [[Cruciatus Curse]] when Harry, who had witnessed the whole thing from under his Invisibility Cloak, revealed himself in sheer anger.

During this term, the school also guided those who would have otherwise completed their studies had it not been for the [[Magic is Might]] Campaign of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his followers, such as [[Muggle-born]]s like [[Hermione Granger]], in finishing their [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.s]].<ref>PotterCast 130</ref>  And while Professor McGonagall eventually went on to become a revered and inspirational Headmistress, it was not an altogether untroubled transition, as the final battle had left marks both seen and unseen upon the denizens of [[Hogwarts Castle]]. The school for instance, though rebuilt, still bore scars decades later,<ref>{{WU}} ([[SOS Task Force Training]] - Calamity Essentials III: Price of Freedom)</ref> and for years after the the Dark Lord's last stand, nearly all of their students were able to see the [[Thestral]]s that pulled the [[Hogwarts carriages]]; serving as a constant, painful reminder of the cost of said event.<ref name=\"WUBE Back to Hogwarts\" /> One such student was [[Grim Fawley]];  a young student in [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]] whose own magical education had been marred by the loss of both his parents to the [[Death Eaters]] in his [[second year]], the same year saw him evacuated along with most of his peers while the older students, teachers and members [[Order of the Phoenix]] waged the legendary [[Battle of Hogwarts]], which resulted in the defeat of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and the conclusion of the [[Second Wizarding War]].\n\nUpon assuming her new position, Minerva relocated; moving out of her sparse, stone-floored bedroom off of the [[first-floor corridor]] and took up permanent residence in Professor Dumbledore's [[Headmaster's Tower|old quarters]], whereupon her new [[Headmaster's Office|study]] became the home to among other things a self-playing harp whose tones could often heard around midday between classes.<ref name=\"WUBE Lost Love\" /> In the time that followed, Professor McGonagall was responsible for, among other things, finding someone to replace her as the school's Transfiguration teacher,<ref>{{WU}} Chapter 2: ''Minerva McGonagall: Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, '''formerly Professor of Transfiguration.'''

Having diligently continued to collect the newcomers escorted by Professor Hagrid even after she was in a position to delegate that task, Professor McGonagall brought the aforementioned [[Unidentified Muggle-born Hogwarts student|Muggle-born]] and the rest of the new students to the [[Great Hall]]. Addressing the students, she held a brief speech about the importance of unity in spite of their individual differences, citing their victory at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] as a prime example of what the castle's residents may accomplish when they work together and putting at ease nervous students by reminding them that even the famous [[Harry Potter]] had started out a student just like themselves. While overseeing the annual [[Sorting ceremony]], however, where she saw the sorting of among others [[Daniel Page]], [[Colby Frey]], [[Lottie Turner]] and [[Robyn Thistlethwaite]] into their respective houses, it quickly became clear that one of the new students, a girl by the name of [[Ivy Warrington]], was missing from the group. Fortunately, Hagrid had found her and brought her forward, explaining she had been distracted by bushes outside the castle. McGonagall found the situation of a student late for the Sorting ceremony to be highly unusual. Nevertheless, she suggested the rest of the student body should enjoy the [[Start-of-Term Feast]] while they still could, as they would have to be well-rested before embarking on the new term.<ref name=\"MA\" />\n\nLater that term, the Headmistress was occupied elsewhere when a group of first-year students sneaked into the [[Headmaster's Tower|Headmistress' Tower]] to use the [[Hogwarts Pensieve|pensieve]] to view a [[memory]] that had been contained within the locket of [[Ivy Warrington]], and as such presumably unaware of their intrusion until afterwards. In light of her disappearance at the beginning of the term, however, Professor McGonagall had reached out to Ivy's family to keep them informed on the situation, and eventually gotten in touch with Miss Warrington's [[Warrington sisters' grandmother|grandmother]], whom she invited to the castle so she could help shred light on the reason behind Ivy's erratic behaviour and apparent memory loss. Sympathetic to the difficulty of Madam Warrington's position in deciding to [[Memory Charm|modify]] the memory of her own grandchild to spare her the pain of knowing that she had accidentally [[Vanishment|vanished]] her own sister, she commended the old witch for her good intentions and assured her that in spite of everything, Ivy had underwent a tremendous amount of personal growth over the course of her first term, and voiced the opinion that she and the group of friends she had made had a bright future ahead of them.<ref name=\"MA2\">{{MA}} ([https://youtu.be/GB2hCrV9YPI?t=408 see video])</ref>\n\n=====2015\u20132016 school year=====\nHaving appointed Mr Lupin the new [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]] over the [[summer holidays]] leading up to his seventh and last year at the school; Minerva greeted the students for the new term; which at [[End-of-Term Feast|its conclusion]] would see the [[Graduation ceremony|departure]] of said student, and at its [[Start-of-Term Feast|beginning]] saw the arrival of among others young [[James Potter II|James Potter]], the oldest son of [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginevra]].

In light of these developments, the faculty at Hogwarts, with Minerva at the helm, dutifully lent their expertise to the [[Calamity Management Team]] to help the agents of the recently established [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] with onerous job of investigating and contain the a \"confounding\" piece of chaotic magic, wherein the [[Hogwarts Headmaster|Hogwarts Headmistress]] was put in charge of overseeing [[Calamity Investigator]]s wishing to pursue a career as [[Professor]]s, whom she warned of the difficulties they would have to face along the way, as well as the fact that they might be called upon to do things they never thought possible. To this end, she invited at least one such person to join the teaching staff at Hogwarts in time for the new term in order to get some experience educating young witches and wizards.<ref>{{WU}} (Professor McGonagall was the one to introduce members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force|SOS Task Force]] to their chosen career during the Calamity.)</ref>\n\nUpon the arrival of a [[Calamity Investigator]] to [[Hogwarts Castle]] to take up a teaching position, Professor McGonagall welcomed the individual by giving them a copy of the letters that were once exchanged between [[Albus Dumbledore]] and [[Adalbert Waffling]] to help improve their skills in addressing the [[Calamity]], specifically in fighting Impaired Foes.<ref>{{WU}} ([[SOS Task Force Training|Professorial Appraisal]]: \"Ideal Exchange\")</ref> Along with teaching them the [[Deterioration Hex]] for purpose of weaken their foes,<ref>{{WU}} ([[SOS Task Force Training|Professorial Appraisal]]: \"The Deterioration Hex\")</ref> she also showed them how to draw on the strength of others when in combat,<ref>{{WU}} ([[SOS Task Force Training|Professorial Appraisal]]: \"Strength in Numbers\"</ref> how to systematically work with academic research to improve their attention for detail,<ref>{{WU}} ([[SOS Task Force Training|Professorial Appraisal]]: \"Attention to Detail\")</ref> and how to augment the effects of the exceptionally powerful [[Protection Charm]] they had previously been taught by [[Filius Flitwick]] by adjusting their stance.<ref>{{WU}} ([[SOS Task Force Training|Professorial Appraisal:]] \"Enhanced Protection Charm\")</ref> During this time, she would also lecture them on how to better connect with their [[Calamity Investigator|teammates]], which helped them get better results with their [[Proficiency Charm]].<ref name=\"Proficiency Charm\">{{WU}} ([[SOS Task Force Training|Professorial Appraisal]]: \"Advanced Proficiency Charm\")</ref> \n\nAs she had done during her time as [[Deputy Headmaster|acting headmistress]] after [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s [[Order of Suspension|suspension]] by the [[Hogwarts Board of Governors|Board of Governors]] during the [[1993\u20131994 school year]], Minerva was determined to run the school as normally as they possibly could under the circumstances. As such, the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup]] was held as planned, and at some point after the [[Quidditch tryouts|tryouts]] of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], Professor McGonagall announced to an gathering of students in the [[Great Hall]] that [[Rose Granger-Weasley]] had made the it as their new [[Chaser]].<ref name=\"Proficiency Charm\" /> Despite their best efforts of everyone involved, however, it eventually became glaringly obvious that the security measures that had been put in place to ensure the safety of the school's residents were woefully insufficient to stop the Calamity from claiming victims from within the castle itself. At some point, students from all the four houses became [[Foundable]]s which appeared in the [[Non-magic world|Muggle world]], which Minerva was unable to control. Many items and special artefacts from Hogwarts became Foundables as well (such as [[portrait]]s), along with several Hogwarts staff memebers, including Minerva herself.<ref name=\"Foundables\">{{WU}} (See [https://wizardsunitehub.info/foundables/ here])</ref>\n\n=====[[2019\u20132020 school year]]=====\n======[[Brilliant Event: Back to Hogwarts|Back to Hogwarts]]======\nShortly before the beginning of the [[2019\u20132020 school year]], she learned that a highly talented student in [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]] would withdraw from the school and transfer to [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]] to distance herself from the surges of chaotic magical activity that was running rampant in Britain, as the Calamity apparently targeting her House.<ref name=\"WUBE Back to Hogwarts2\">{{WU}} \"[[Brilliant Event: Back to Hogwarts]]\"</ref> Even so, the Headmistress took no small amount of pride in the fact that more than seventy-four percent of the volunteers that had taken time off their busy schedules to assist the Ministry - by quill and parchment - with the job of tracking, sorting, cataloguing, collating, and [[Returned Foundable Manifest|archiving]] returned [[Foundable]]s for the Ministry were current and former members of [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]].<ref name=\"WUBE Back to Hogwarts2\" /> Around the same time, Minerva also received owls from no less than three students in [[Ravenclaw|Ravenclaw House]] asking if they could receive their lesson plans early as not to fall behind in their studies, an exchange she noted that it was not uncommon for her to have with students of that house at the beginning of each term.<ref name=\"WUBE Back to Hogwarts2\" />\n\nWhen the [[Hogwarts Express]] was whisked away by The Calamity just shortly prior to its scheduled departure on [[1 September]], however, she quickly solicited the assistance of a highly reputable member of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force|SOS Task Force]] that [[Hermione Granger]] had recommended, hoping said individual could returned the train in time for the new school year. In the meantime, however,  due to the ongoing surge, a number of [[Foundable]]s materialised on the school grounds, including [[Werewolf|Werewolves]] and [[Fire-breathing chicken]]s, expressing the concern that lest the Calamity was not dealt with, she would have to spend the entire school term keeping [[First Year]] [[Gryffindor]]s and [[Rubeus Hagrid]] away from them.\n\nThe [[Calamity Investigator]] was eventually successful in returning the Hogwarts Express in time for the start of the term, much to the relief of Minerva; who pointed out that the time-honoured tradition of riding the train to school was as much part of the \"Hogwarts experience\" as the [[Sorting ceremony]]. She was also relieved to hear of the safe return of the [[Trolley witch]], who had been turned into a [[Foundable]] and at some point afterwards retrieved by the aforementioned Task Force member, saying that the [[Hogwarts Express]] would not be the same without her and her sweets, noting that she could remember her working at the train even back when Minerva herself was a student, during which she was \"partial\" to her [[Pumpkin Pasty|Pumpkin Pasties]].<ref name=\"WUBE Back to Hogwarts2\" />\n\nThat was not to say that her troubles was over, however, as The Calamity hit the school itself next, spiriting off with the [[Sorting Hat]], a [[Thestral]]s from Hogwart's [[Hogwarts Thestral herd|herd]], one of their [[Hogwarts carriages|carriages]], a [[Hogwarts boats|boat]], a Winged Boar Statue and even the sign directing people between [[Hogwarts Castle]] and [[Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade Village]]; all of which the same diligent individual was able to retrieve and return to their allotted places, much to the delight of the denizens of Hogwarts Castle. Upon thanking their saviour, the Headmistress informed them that the school had suffered no lasting effects from the recent outburst of the Calamity, not counting the students' new favourite excuse for nothing finishing their schoolwork in time; 'the Calamity stole my homework!'<ref name=\"WUBE Back to Hogwarts2\" />\n\n======[[Brilliant Event: Lost Love|The Lost Love]]======\nLater on during the term, Professor McGonagall reached out to the same individual that had done such an exemplary job helping the school earlier that school year, informing them that the [[Calamity]] had spirited away with quite a few of items of a \"personal and private nature\", soliciting their assistance in getting them back. Along on this endeavour was one of her former students and fellow Head of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]], [[Constance Pickering]], who kept commenting and asking questions about each of the artefacts as they were retrieved, much to the dismay of the Headmistress. The first possession to be returned to her self-playing harp, at which point Minerva showed signs of mild exasperation when she had to explain to Miss Pickering that the self-playing instrument had, as the name suggests, been bewitched to play itself. The next items on the list was the [[memory]] of a [[Minerva McGonagall's hornbill|hornbill]] that she once owned, which she had used as a teaching aid during her career as a [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] professor, and remembered it fondly as \"a good bird\", although she had not viewed it as a pet, as she was more partial to cats. The next items on the list included a school crest and her [[Order of Merlin]], First Class, which she had framed and kept in her office, and an old photo of [[Dougal McGregor]], about whom she refused to comment when Pickering questioned the man's identity, saying only that he was \"''a man [she} once knew''\" and that that was all she was prepared to say on the matter.<ref name=\"WUBE Lost Love2\">{{WU}} \"Brilliant Event: Lost Love\"</ref> When all of the items had been retrieved, she lightly admonished Miss Pickering for prying into her personal life, noting that she had a keen and inquisitive mind, but that she needed to learn that she did not have the right to the answer of every question just because she asked.<ref name=\"WUBE Lost Love2\" />\n\n======[[Brilliant Event: The Quidditch Cup|Inter-House Cup]]======\nIn spite of the fact that the security of the castle had been breached more than once as a result of the [[Calamity]], and, having taken into account the prevailing theory that if enough people focused on something, it could affect how said phenomenon behaved, the decision to permit the annual and always much anticipated [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Inter-House Quidditch League]] to go on as planned was not one Minerva made lightly. Having concluded, however, that the collective disappointment at its cancellation would be more likely to trigger a new surge with Hogwarts at the heart of it than to allow the student body their yearly competition, the new season was held as normal. It was later noted that the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] had, despite some injuries on the part of the players, a fine showing that season, as had the [[Slytherin Quidditch team|Slytherin team]], which the Headmistress herself judged to have been deserving recognition for their successes. Having proceeded without incidents for most of its duration, it was only as the final matches of the contest that the Calamity was drawn back to the [[Highlands|Scottish Highlands]] and whisked away with among other things the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Hogwarts Quidditch Cup]]. Upon learning this, Professor McGonagall alerted the Ministry of Magic, which sent an agent from the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] to recover the all. One of the [[Foundable]]s in question was an old [[Nimbus 2000]], prompting a [[Chaser]] on the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] to grow concerned that her broom, which of the same model, might vanish and be weakened if the same happened to hers, to which her headmistress assured her that the broom in question was almost certainly the echo of [[Harry Potter's Nimbus 2000|the one]] that once belonged to another, [[Harry Potter|famous student]] that played on their team years earlier. When the [[Gryffindor]] house ghost, [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]], was spirited away by the Calamity along with the cup and turned him into a Foundable, Minerva was delighted to see his safe return, stating that she had meant to ask his opinion on the Calamity, seen as how he, being somewhat separated from his original self, just like the Foundables were, perhaps had some interesting insights into the Calamity they had not considered.<ref name=\"WUBE HQC2\">{{WU}} \"Brilliant Event: Hogwarts Quidditch Cup\"</ref>\n\n=====[[2020\u20132021 school year]]=====\nAs though the [[Calamity]] was not bad enough; conceding with the ongoing catastrophe was also the discovery that various dark and dagerous magical creatures that had once allied themselves with the Dark Lord had began to behave rather conspicuously. As a staple in the magical community, Minerva was present at the Extraordinary General Meetings, most notably the meeting in 2020 where they discussed the concerning movement of Voldemort's allies. Furthermore, Minerva also revealed that someone had taken [[Boomslang skin]] and [[Lacewing fly|lacewing flies]] from the Potions stores during the summer break, the ingredients for [[Polyjuice Potion]].<ref name=\"CC\">{{CC}}</ref>\n\n======Assisting Albus Potter======\n[[File:Harryandminerva.jpeg|250px|thumb|right|Minerva and [[Harry Potter|Harry]] arguing over [[Albus Potter|Albus]] and [[Scorpius Malfoy|Scorpius]]'s friendship]]\nWhen [[Albus Potter]] and [[Scorpius Malfoy]] did not arrive at Hogwarts with the [[Hogwarts Express]] on [[1 September]], [[2020]], Minerva sent owls to their parents and later met with [[Harry Potter]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Potter]] and [[Draco Malfoy]], along with [[Minister for Magic]] [[Hermione Granger]] and her husband [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], to find them.

Minerva used the map to discover that they were in the [[Moaning Myrtle's Bathroom|girls' bathroom on the first floor]].

As punishment for their recklessness, however, she put both in [[Discipline at Hogwarts#Detention|detention]] for the reminder of the year, and placed on them both a blanket ban on all future [[Hogsmeade weekend trips|Hogsmeade trips]], before telling them to find the missing Time-Turner.<ref name=\"CC\" />\n\n==Physical appearance==\n{{Quote|The door swung open at once.

She had black hair which was rarely let down, and the majority of the time was combed back into a tight bun.<ref name=\"Hair\" /> In her youth, Minerva was described to not be as beautiful as her [[Isobel Ross|mother]], but she was still rather pretty according to her picture in that age.  \n\nMinerva always had a very prim expression. She also was known for her mouth to become very thin whenever she was angry. [[Harry Potter|Harry]] Potter made analogies to McGonagall looking like she was going to explode, breathe fire and shoot sparks from her nose based on how transparent her anger could appear. When Minerva was happy or relaxed, she seemed like a different person entirely. She was capable of blending into [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] crowds though Harry noted that the appearance didn't suit her.\n\nMinerva often wore emerald green robes or her favourite tartan pattern. She wore square spectacles that matched the markings around the eyes of her [[Animagus]] and [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]]: a silver tabby cat. She also wore a pointed hat cocked to one side.

Used to having her way, she tolerated neither audacity nor silliness from her pupils and was known to turn cold towards people who said or did things in front of her that were stupid, or if she thought they were trying to be funny.<ref name=\"GOF\" /> She was a woman who rarely smiled or gave compliments freely.

She fought the Death Eaters and protected her students, proving her bravery. Despite her loyalty to her house, Minerva was a fair-minded person who was known for docking points from students in her own House when she saw it must be done.<ref name=\"PS\" /> Although she permitted of-age students to choose whether they wanted  to stay or evacuate for the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] as a respect for their valour and rights, she gave the strict orders for anyone underage to evacuate, prioritising their safety over their courage and refusing to let under-qualified children risk  dying in battle despite their desires.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\nFor the most part, though, Minerva usually maintained great emotional composure, without being indifferent. Although she wasn't always particularly personable, she could be very warm and supportive during times of trouble or loss and cared a great deal about her students, both personally and academically. She was known to be extremely caring in times of tragedy, being known for her kindness in her own reserved manner. Though it rarely happened, Minerva showed a temper that could reveal itself on occasions when she was angry or flustered.<ref name=\"GOF\" /> Apparently, she shared this temper with her father.

She become an [[Animagus]] - a complicated, long process- to further her study in this subject and enjoyed correcting articles in [[Transfiguration Today]]. On the other hand, Minerva had very little patience for the field of [[Divination]], due to its impreciseness and rarity of true Seers.<ref name=\"POA\" />\n\nThough she gave up Quidditch on leaving Hogwarts, the innately competitive Minerva later took a keen interest in the fortunes of her house team and retained a keen eye for Quidditch talent. She enjoyed watching [[Quidditch]], and supported the [[Montrose Magpies]].\n\nMinerva inherited her cast-iron moral sense from her father. As a law-abiding citizen, she respected the particular law that all Animagi of Britain must register, insisting that [[Talbott Winger]] do so despite understanding his reason of secrecy. She wasn't inducted into the Order of the Phoenix during Voldemort\u2019s first climb to power because the Order was held as a renegade outfit by the Ministry, who feared Dumbledore\u2019s charisma and magical talent and were inclined to harbour fears that he wished to succeed them. Instead, she became their informant and bravely spied on Voldemort's followers in the guise of a cat.<ref name=\"OOTP\" />\n\nHowever, by the time of the second wizarding war, Minerva was no longer prepared to act as a spy for a Ministry she believed had become corrupt and dangerous. She is known to have a very severe dislike and hatred of those who abused power, such as her making an enemy of [[Dolores Umbridge]] for the latter's bigoted and sadistic behaviour. This also displayed her own distaste for racial prejudice and sadism.<ref name=\"OOTP\" /> Following the confrontation with the Death Eaters who had invaded Hogwarts at the time of Albus Dumbledore\u2019s death, Minerva became a fully fledged member of the Order of the Phoenix, which was now, more than ever, seen as an outlaw organisation. Similarly, she stood up to [[Amycus Carrow]], despite the Death Eater's higher authority at the time, refusing to let him blame the students for [[Alecto Carrow|Alecto's]] blunder and looked down at him with pure disgust.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\nIn her free-time, Minerva was known to enjoy needlework.<ref name=\"pottermorebio\" />\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n{{Quote|Minerva was a gifted Transfiguration student to say the least. But it's been most satisfying to see her grow into a master of magic as well.|[[Albus Dumbledore]] on Minerva's outstanding magical power and knowledge|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}[[File:Patronus Cat2.jpg|192x192px|thumb|Minerva McGonagall's Patronus, a cat]]\nMinerva McGonagall was an incredibly powerful and talented [[Wizardkind|witch]] whom none should have ever underestimated. Her magical prowess allowed her to be the teacher of [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]], a remarkably complex field of magic which she proved to be an expert in. She was also highly capable in many areas of magic as well as Transfiguration, the proof of this being she survived both Wizarding Wars and a duel with Voldemort himself, as well as correctly brewing the extremely advanced Animagus potion at only seventeen years of age. She was also the only person ever seen to produce three Patronus charms at once, which she additionally did non-verbally. Many wizards and witches alike are unable to produce one Patronus whilst saying the incantation, so this is further evidence of Minerva's world class ability.\n{{Quote|Professor McGonagall is the most powerful witch I know.|[[Jacob's sibling]] on Minerva's outstanding magical prowess|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n\n*'''[[Magic]]al mastery''': Minerva was an exceptionally powerful and talented witch, having inherited such talent from her mother and great-grandmother. She achieved top grades in her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.Ls]] and [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.Ts]] when she was at [[Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry|Hogwarts]], being quickly recognised as the most outstanding student of her year, with a particular talent for [[Transfiguration]]. During her school years, she was the recipient of several awards such as the \"''Transfiguration Today'' Most Promising Newcomer Award\". As an adult, Minerva displayed her tremendous skills and powers by successfully becoming the [[Head of Transfiguration]], Deputy Headmistress, and Headmistress at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She had extremely advanced magical knowledge, proving herself capable time and time again of mastering and performing highly advanced and difficult spells. Voldemort himself respected her ability, given that even when he controlled the school, and her unwavering loyalty to Dumbledore, she was kept on as Transfiguration professor showing her Transfiguration skills were tremendous. Her duelling skills were also exceptional, for she faced some of the greatest magical talent of the age and lived to tell the tale. When facing Snape in battle, one of the few wizards who could have rivalled McGonagall for magical skill, her magical assault was such he was forced onto the back foot almost immediately. Along with surviving both Wizarding Wars, she even went on to challenge Voldemort himself along with Horace Slughorn and Kingsley Shacklebolt at the very end of the second wizarding war, holding him at bay from harming the crowd that had gathered to watch. Though they were ultimately overpowered, neither side were able to hurt the other, further showing her extraordinary skill.\n*'''[[Wandless magic|Wandless]] and [[Nonverbal spell|nonverbal magic]]''': Minerva was shown to be extremely skilful at non-verbal magic for a wide variety of spells, especially transfiguration spells and charms which she could perform with just a wave of her wand. This is a testament to her formidable magical skills as both these branches of magic are difficult to begin with not to mention to do them non verbally which requires intense concentration and focus. She could even perform certain spells intentionally without her wand, such as the [[Avifors spell]]<ref name=\"COSG\">{{COS|G}}</ref> and often wandlessly conjured a textbook into her hands during Transfiguration class. She stalemated and gained the upper hand over Severus Snape in a fierce duel without uttering a single incantation which is further evidence of her extraordinary skills - lesser witches and wizards seemed to produce weaker magic when using non-verbal spells or under the influence of Silencing Charms, but she seemed unhindered. She was fully capable of disintegrating Snape's fiery serpent he sent at her with just a wave of her wand and instantly turning it into swarm of daggers without saying the incantation. They were so powerful even without the incantation that he was forced to hide behind a suit of armour.<ref name=\"DH30\" /> She non-verbally untransfigured Draco Malfoy when he was turned into a ferret by simply pointing her wand at him.<ref name=\"GOF13\">{{GOF|B|13}}</ref> When Neville Longbottom vanished one of the legs of his desk by accident during a lesson, she had it back very shortly after with just a wave of her wand. She also non-verbally [[Silver rope conjuring spell|conjured a length of shimmering silver rope]] to hang the Carrow siblings before the Battle of Hogwarts to incapacitate them.<ref name=\"DH30\" /> If her ability to conjure three consecutive Patronuses at once was not impressive enough, it should also be noted she did so non-verbally, which is an extraordinarily challenging feat, considering the difficulty of conjuring a single one with the incantation.<ref name=\"DH30\" />\n{{Quote|As if one of them could have Stunned Minerva McGonagall face-on by daylight!|[[Poppy Pomfrey]] on Minerva's exceptional duelling capabilities|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n[[File:Fiery Offensive Spell.gif|277x277px|thumb|McGonagall duelling Snape]]\n\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': Minerva was an immensely skilful duellist. She was described as moving \"faster than [[Harry Potter|Harry]] Potter would have believed\", displaying an incredible amount of speed and precision with her spell work. Though she was hit by four [[Stunning Spell|stunning spells]] without warning by a group of [[Three Aurors who tried to arrest Rubeus Hagrid|Aurors]], [[Poppy Pomfrey]] furiously insisted that they wouldn't have stood a chance in an actual fight.<ref name=\"OOTP\" /> During the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], Minerva easily overpowered [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] [[Alecto Carrow]] even when she had aid from [[Amycus Carrow|her brother]], sending them desperately escaping from her spells, and survived the battle unscathed.<ref name=\"HBP\" /> In 1998, shortly before the Battle of Hogwarts, she proved herself capable of not only matching [[Severus Snape]] in a fierce duel, quickly and easily countering all of his spells and responding with her own, but she also managed to begin to gain the upper hand sending daggers so powerful after him that he was forced to take refuge behind a shield of armour when he couldn't counter her spell. With aid from Pomona Sprout and Filius Flitwick, she swiftly forced Snape to flee from the school by jumping out of a classroom window and flying through the grounds. Even without them, her ability to make Snape unable to counter one of her spells showed Minerva alone could have probably eventually defeated Snape (although it must also be noted that Snape wasn't fighting to kill her). Minerva emerged as one of the survivors of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] and most likely defeated many Death Eaters given her previous results in duels. Alongside [[Horace Slughorn]] and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], she even duelled [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] himself to a stalemate and they were only overpowered when Voldemort's rage of Bellatrix's death caused his magic to explode, although it must be noted that Voldemort was wielding the [[Elder Wand]] at the time without having achieved mastery over it and Harry's [[Sacrificial protection|loving sacrifice]] was weakening the power of Voldemort's spells.<ref name=\"DH\" /> It should also be noted, in her favour, that she, Horace and Kingsley had been fighting Death Eaters for hours before facing Voldemort, whereas Voldemort had only just entered battle. Her duelling knowledge remained even as she grew older, with her instructing members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] how to improve their sight and teamwork.<ref name=\"WU\" /> She was also incredibly skilled in manipulating and using her environment to her advantage in battle, which made her an extremely formidable opponent in duels. Her most impressive uses of this came in the duel with Snape, where she utilised the torches on the walls to make a fiery whirlwind, and at the beginning of the Battle of Hogwarts, when she [[Piertotum Locomotor|brought the various desks and chairs to life]], leading them into battle against her Death Eater opponents.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n{{Quote|Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape\u2019s desk.

With guidance from her teacher Albus Dumbledore, she was skilled enough to achieve the [[Animagus]] transformation at the young age of seventeen, a highly advanced and challenging process that could be disastrous if gotten wrong. Her record was so impressive that upon finishing her seventh year, she was awarded the \u201c[[Transfiguration Today Most Promising Newcomer award|Most Promising Newcomer Award]]\u201d by [[Transfiguration Today]]. Upon returning to Hogwarts to teach, she was offered a job as Professor of Transfiguration, under Head of Department, Albus Dumbledore.<ref name=\"pottermorebio\" /> Her mastery, skill and power in this immensely difficult branch of magic meant she took over the job as [[Head of Transfiguration]] upon Dumbledore\u2019s promotion to Headmaster, a job title she retained until she herself became [[Headmaster]] in 1998. She would later regard it as \u201csome of the most complex and dangerous\u201d magic taught at Hogwarts.<ref name=\"PS\" /> As an adult, her skills in Transfiguration were known to be exceptional, [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] himself respecting her skills given that she was kept on as Head of Transfiguration even when he controlled the school, despite her allegiance to Dumbledore making her a prime target. Minerva was therefore phenomenally accomplished in all branches of transfiguration, including [[Conjuration]], [[Vanishment]], [[Transformation]] and [[Untransfiguration]]. She could perform advanced transfiguration spells with just a quick flick of her wand, for example untransfiguring [[Draco Malfoy]] back into human form, which she did simply by pointing her wand at him.<ref name=\"GOF13\" /> Like Dumbledore, she seemed especially proficient at conjuration.

During both [[Wizarding Wars]], Minerva remained staunch in opposing [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] even if she did fear speaking his name, which she soon overcame, despite the losses of many of her friends and even when all hope seemed lost with Dumbledore dying and [[Severus Snape|Snape]] taking over, Minerva continued to oppose Voldemort and help protect the students from [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow|the Carrows]]. She defiantly led the defenders during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] and even faced Voldemort himself despite [[Harry Potter|Harry]]'s apparent death seemingly rendering the Dark Lord unbeatable. Minerva's moral compass also remained steadfast even in the face of great victories as she did not hesitate to take 150 [[House points]] from Gryffindor to punish Harry, [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] despite how close Gryffindor was to winning the [[House Cup]] and she remained adamant in confiscating Harry's [[Firebolt]] even though it would greatly benefit the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]].\n*'''Teaching skills''': Being the Head of [[Transfiguration]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], Minerva was an extremely skilled and efficient teacher during her time in this position and was one of the few professors at Hogwarts who could keep a class quiet with minimal effort as a result of her strict nature, making her one of the most respected teachers at Hogwarts.

Albus discovered Minerva in tears in her classroom late one evening after she found out about [[Dougal McGregor]]'s marriage with another woman. She confessed the whole story to him, and he offered both comfort and wisdom; telling her some of his own family history, previously unknown to her.\n\nThe confidences exchanged between the two intensely private and reserved characters were to form the basis of a lasting mutual esteem and friendship. Despite this fact, she had never been fully in his or Dumbledore's confidence. Minerva was one of only a handful of people who knew how dreadful a moment it was for Dumbledore when he made the decision to confront and defeat the Dark wizard [[Gellert Grindelwald]] in [[1945]].<ref name=\"shortstories\" />\n\nMinerva served for many years as his [[Headmaster|Deputy Headmistress]], standing in for him in dangerous situations and even replacing him as Headmistress on several occasions.<ref name=\"COS\" /><ref name=\"HBP\" /> She also served more than once to bring Dumbledore back on track when he became distracted from the matter currently at hand.<ref name=\"GOF\" /> Minerva had great faith in Dumbledore, placing great stock in the differences between him and Voldemort.<ref name=\"PS\" /> However, she didn't hesitate to disagree with him when she felt the need to do so, greatly opposing his decision to place Harry Potter with [[Petunia Dursley]]'s family<ref name=\"PSF\" /> and his policy of allowing Harry to run extreme risks.\n\nMinerva never hesitated in displaying her loyalty to Dumbledore. When [[Cornelius Fudge]] brought Aurors to arrest Dumbledore in 1996, she boldly stepped forward and announced her intention to fight the Aurors on his behalf. She only stepped back at Dumbledore's insistence when he reminded her that Hogwarts and her students would need her in his absence.<ref name=\"OOTP\" /> Minerva was devastated when Dumbledore was killed in [[1997]] during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and arranged his funeral.<ref name=\"HBP\" /> A year later, when Harry was on a mission given to him by Dumbledore, she didn't question the decision of the late headmaster, but immediately sought to provide whatever assistance she could.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\n===Harry Potter===\n{{Quote|You couldn't find two people who are less like us.

She was sort of a loving grandmother to him and expressed concern with both Dumbledore's choice trusting Hagrid to safely transport Harry to [[Little Whinging]], and of the choice of family with whom Harry would stay. She spent hours on end spying on the Dursleys to get an insight to what life for Harry growing up would be like,<ref name=\"PS\" /> calling them \"the worst sort of Muggles imaginable\".<ref name=\"PSF\" />  It is unlikely, however, that she kept watch over Harry, as she would never go against Dumbledore's actions, no matter how much she disagreed with them.\n\nWhen Harry arrived at Hogwarts, Minerva was naturally pleased that he was sorted into Gryffindor, her house and as he studied in Hogwarts. Although her relationship with him remained mostly normal, she kept a watchful eye on him and his friends [[Ronald Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] to ensure his safety. She also (along with the other professors) reported that he was likeable, humble and talented.<ref name=\"DH33\">{{DH|B|33}}</ref> Although she was fully willing to punish him for his misdeeds, Minerva would not hesitate to intervene in their affairs whenever necessary to keep them safe and ensured that Harry would not be punished too severely. This was shown when Harry and his friends were caught sneaking around the tower in the dead of night during their first year at Hogwarts and she sent him off to serve detention in the [[Forbidden Forest]].\n\nHowever, rather than punishing or expelling him for having broken Madam Hooch's order that no student would ride on their broomsticks and the risk he took, Minerva brought him to see [[Oliver Wood]], captain of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], announcing that she had found their new [[Seeker]]. In her gratitude for Harry accepting the position, she bought him a [[Nimbus 2000]] for his first Quidditch game.<ref name=\"PS\" /> Her affection for him even allowed her to forgive him and Ron's use of the Weasleys's flying car to reach Hogwarts, which risked exposure of the wizarding world and broke several of the international laws, a far more serious deed than smuggling Norbert out of Hogwarts, without even taking House Points from Gryffindor and only punishing him and Ron by giving them both detention.

Yes, I\u2019m fine.|McGonagall reassuring Harry before the first task of the Triwizard Tournament|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\nWhen Harry became the fourth Triwizard Champion, Minerva adamantly defended Harry from the accusation of [[Olympe Maxime]] that Harry had been willing to die for the gold rewarded and even went as far as to try to convince Albus into not letting Harry compete, being utterly mortified by the fact that Snape and Dumbledore were willing to use Harry as a bait and often showed herself to be more protective of Harry than the then Headmaster. She also wanted to keep Harry out of the explanation the imposter was about to give, believing Harry had had enough, but reluctantly conceded to Dumbledore's wish that Harry stay. However, she was quick to praise his performance and assure he was tended to in the First Task and helped him train for the Third Task by lending her room.\n\nIn Harry's fifth year, Minerva promised Harry that she would do whatever she possibly could to see that he achieved his dream of becoming an [[Auror]]. She supported him unequivocally even though she had never been fully in his confidence. When she later found out about the sort of [[Black Quill|punishment]] Harry and various other students had been receiving from [[Dolores Umbridge]], Minerva expressed nothing but absolute disgust and disapproval, despite the power Umbridge wielded.<ref name=\"OOTP\" /> In return, although Harry disliked her strictness regarding his opposition of Umbridge, he was still grateful for her care towards him and was utterly infuriated when McGonagall was attacked so severely by the Aurors sent to capture Hagrid she had to be sent to St Mungo to the point where he even believed Umbridge being murdered brutally (fed to a [[Blast-Ended Skrewt]]) was not a punishment good enough and immediately felt such anger that he coldly defied Umbridge when she gloated over McGonagall's current state despite being cornered.\n\n{{Quote|Why would Harry Potter try to get inside [[Ravenclaw Tower]]? Potter belongs in ''my'' House!|McGonagall's pride that Harry belongs in her house|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\nShortly prior to the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Amycus Carrow - who, along with his sister [[Alecto Carrow|Alecto]], had been posted at the school by Voldemort - demanded to know where Harry was in the Tower and McGonagall asked why he would be there as he belonged in her house, with clear pride in her voice. When Amycus spat at McGonagall, Harry was outraged to the point of attacking him with the [[Cruciatus Curse]], even agreeing with [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]'s assertion that one had to \"really mean it\" to perform the curse correctly. Although shocked by Harry's sudden appearance and his use of an [[Unforgivable Curses|Unforgivable Curse]], she was clearly touched by the gesture. Though Minerva initially tried to convince Harry to flee out of concern for his safety, she immediately joined Harry in retaking the castle and preparing for battle. She did this when he informed her that he was acting on Dumbledore's orders. Nearing the end of the Battle of Hogwarts, Minerva's devastation was great when she saw [[Rubeus Hagrid]] carrying Harry's seemingly dead body. This grief was enough to make her duel Voldemort head on in the final battle, alongside [[Horace Slughorn]] and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], in order to protect the rest of her students. When the battle ended with Voldemort's death at Harry's hands, she was among the first to embrace him.<ref name=\"DH\" />  \n\nThe two continued to have a very positive relationship over the following years. Harry acted as a frequent guest lecturer on Defence Against The Dark Arts, under Minerva's jurisdiction. She would serve as Headmistress over Harry's three children, and in turn she learned to expect them to get into the same kinds of trouble as their father. This was to be expected, after having now taught and served over three generations of Potters. Minerva's relationship with Harry experienced a brief strain when he blackmailed her into using the Marauder's Map to ensure Albus and Scorpius remains apart, which she felt great discontent at doing, but it was reconciled when Harry apologised and she wasn't shown to hold any ill-will afterwards.\n\n===Hermione Granger===\n{{Quote|Ah, of course.

She gave Hermione one of her \"rare smiles\". Hence, Minerva was extremely shocked and disappointed in Hermione when she said she had gone looking for the [[Troll]] that invaded [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], under the impression that she could stop it. The claim wasn't true, but Minerva was none the wiser.<ref name=\"PS\" /> When Hermione was attacked by the [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk]] in 1992, Minerva was greatly moved and would often take time to visit her Petrified student in the hospital wing.<ref name=\"COS\" />\n\nIn Hermione's third year, Minerva went to the effort to arrange for Hermione to be given permission to use a [[Time-Turner]] to take additional classes. Teachers didn't often seek permission for a student to use one of the devices, but she saw something special in Hermione and went out of her way to make sure the younger witch wasn't under-achieving.<ref name=\"POA\" /> Hermione further showed her high regard of Hermione, by appointing her a Gryffindor [[prefect]] in her fifth year at Hogwarts. When Minerva was attacked by several Ministry employees outside of Hagrid's Hut, Hermione showed deep emotion towards the event, like Minerva did a few years before. She and McGonagall were allies during the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], surviving the [[Second Wizarding War]].\n\nMinerva was a role model for Hermione and both had much in common.

The two clashed when he and [[Harry Potter|Harry]] flew [[Arthur Weasley]]'s flying car to Hogwarts. However, she didn't wish to see them expelled. During the [[Yule Ball]], Minerva showed the other students how to dance by dancing with Ron in front of the whole class, a move which prompted laughter from the class and Fred and George agreeing to always tease him about it.\n\nRon is appointed [[prefect]] by McGonagall in his fifth year after most likely being persuaded by Dumbledore, as he felt that Harry had enough responsibilities to deal with.

They were eventually tortured into insanity by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]].

As she wasn't a Slytherin, Malfoy didn't respect her at all but was never foolish enough to make this clear in front of her. \n\nDespite her clear disapproval of Malfoy's pure-blood supremacist leanings, McGonagall sought to protect him as much as every other student, being completely appalled when [[Alastor Moody]] ([[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] in disguise) [[Human to ferret spell|transformed]] Draco into a ferret in 1994. She transformed Malfoy back into his human form and reminded Moody that they never use transfiguration as a punishment. In addition, Minerva wouldn't accept Harry's accusations of Malfoy mailing a [[Opal Necklace|cursed necklace]] without sufficient evidence, nor condone any attacks Harry made on Malfoy such as when the former used the [[Sectumsempra]] curse (not knowing exactly what it did) on Malfoy, in 1997.\n\nHowever, when Draco was proven to have led a group of Death Eaters into the castle, Minerva came to see him as much an enemy as any Death Eater, until after the war, where Draco was pardoned. At which point. Minerva and Draco established a cordial relationship, as she accepted Draco's [[Scorpius Malfoy|son]] into Hogwarts and treated him just as she would every student despite whatever dark feelings she may had towards Draco for his misdeeds, being utterly appealed at Harry's request that she help Albus and Scorpius stay apart. Draco also trusted her into using the Marauder's Map to find his son and Albus and fully accepted whatever punishment would be given to Scorpius, acknowledging he believed her decision would be fair.\n\n===Weasley family===\n[[File:Weasley family.png|245x245px|thumb|The [[Weasley family]]]]\nMcGonagall and the [[Weasley family|Weasleys]] get along well, considering they were all in [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]] and fellow members of the Order of the Phoenix. However, Minerva disapproved of [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]]'s behaviour at school, although she still seemed impressed by their magical skills. When [[Dolores Umbridge]] was appointed as High Inquisitor for Hogwarts, she allied with the twins and attempted to oppose Umbridge.\n\nMinerva was fond of all the Weasley children, including [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]]. She was glad that Ginny was sorted into Gryffindor, and, although Ginny thought McGonagall was a little strict, she believed that the Transfiguration professor was also fair. Both witches tried to oppose Umbridge (in 1995) and the Carrows (in 1998). Furthermore, Minerva had high regard and expectations of [[Percy Weasley]], who was a Gryffindor prefect and [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]] in his last year at Hogwarts.\n\n===The Marauders and Lily Evans===\n{{Quote|Is it true, Albus?

After they left Hogwarts, both McGonagall became allies with her former students, who became members of the first Order of the Phoenix.\n\nThe Marauders were four great friends: [[Remus Lupin]], [[Peter Pettigrew]], [[Sirius Black]] and [[James Potter I|James Potter]]. Despite their boisterous ways, at odds with Minerva's no-nonsense reputation, they seemed to have a good relationship with her. Coincidentally, both McGonagall and the Marauders had the accomplishment of becoming Animagi. This information most likely not privy to her.\n\n[[File:Lily Potter1.jpg|238x238px|thumb|[[Lily J.

McGonagall seems to have had a good relationship with his future wife, Lily Evans[[Prefect|.]] The couple would later become [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]] and [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Girl]]; neither appointment would have happened if their Head of House had not approved, which means she trusted them. McGonagall was devastated at the murder in 1981 of Lily and James, both of whom she considered her all-time favourites. She later became friendly with the Potters' son, Harry, who was also her student and a member of her House, though she did not show favouritism and was more than willing to take many points even from her own House for misbehaviour.\n\nA little over a decade after he left Hogwarts, Remus Lupin (a former [[Prefect]] of her House) returned to the school in order to teach [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], becoming Minerva's professional colleaguein 1993. She didn't care about the fact Remus was a werewolf, because Dumbledore trusted him, and respected his efficient teaching skills, as she referenced him during Harry's [[Careers Advice]]. The two  were members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] in the [[Second Wizarding War]]. After Dumbledore's death, McGonagall, Lupin and several other individuals were devastated; they all discussed about the way Snape killed Dumbledore. Sadly, Lupin himself died in the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nMinerva had a good relationship with Sirius Black. But after James' death, she, the rest of the wizarding community, assumed it was Sirius who betrayed the Potters since he was expected to be their [[Secret Keeper|Secret-Keeper]]. Only in 1995 did she learn that the Secret-Keeper at the time of the Potters' deaths was actually Peter Pettigrew, who took the title after Sirius turned it down. Sirius was murdered by his own cousin [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] in 1996. Minerva's reaction to Sirius's death is unreported.\n\n{{Quote|Hero-worshipped Black and Potter. Never quite in their league, talent-wise. I was often rather sharp with him... Stupid boy... Foolish boy...|McGonagall's low opinion of Peter Pettigrew|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}\nMinerva had a pretty poor relationship with Peter Pettigrew, describing him as a \"stupid\" and \"foolish\" boy. She confessed that she was harsher than necessary with him during their time together as student and teacher, even when \"hero-worshipped\" James Potter and Sirius Black for the mischief. Peter faked his own death standing up to Sirius, who was a suspect in the Potters' betrayal, leading McGonagall to regret that she had been harsh towards him and to acknowledge him as a brave Gryffindor.\n\n===Rubeus Hagrid===\n{{Quote|I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place, but you can't pretend he's not careless.|McGonagall's opinion of Hagrid in delicate situations|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}\n[[File:Rubeus Hagrid.jpg|226x226px|thumb|left|[[Rubeus Hagrid]], her friend and colleague]]\nRubeus Hagrid respected McGonagall. Hagrid was the gamekeeper, and later [[Care of Magical Creatures]] professor of Hogwarts. McGonagall was one of the most serious professors at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], and sometimes disapproved of Hagrid's behaviour, especially during the [[Sorting ceremony]]. However, they were still close friends, were both members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], and admired Albus Dumbledore.\n\nHagrid once kissed McGonagall on her cheek when he had drunk very much and she was noted giving a flushed giggle in the event's festivities. When Dolores Umbridge and several [[Auror]]s from the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] sought to sack and exile Hagrid from the school grounds by force, Minerva quickly flew to his aid, in turn taking four stunners simultaneously to the chest. Hagrid was disgusted when the Aurors stunned and injured her to the point that he attacked them in an uncontrollable rage before fleeing, furiously denouncing them as cowards.\n\nIn 1997, after Albus Dumbledore's death, Minerva stated that she appreciated Hagrid's opinion very much, as did Dumbledore. McGonagall and Hagrid fought against [[Death Eaters]] during the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. They were among the first ones to run to congratulate Harry after he defeated Voldemort. They both survived the war and still taught at Hogwarts.\n\n===Severus Snape===\n{{Quote|And Potter \u2014 do try and win, won't you?

After he had graduated and then returned as the [[Potion]]s master, he and McGonagall became colleagues. As Head of [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]], McGonagall and Snape teased one another about House points and Quidditch standings, acting like friendly rivals to one another. Like Snape, McGonagall was a strict disciplinarian, but was fairer to [[Harry Potter]], who was a member of her House. \n\nBoth were demanding and effective teachers, unusually talented at magic, and loyal to Albus Dumbledore, so over time, Minerva grew to respect Severus despite his dark past. McGonagall knew that Snape was a Death Eater in his youth, but she followed [[Albus Dumbledore]] in believing that he truly regretted his former allegiance. She did, however, admit to being suspicious of Snape's true allegiance though she trusted him simply because Albus did. Unusually for Snape, he was on first name terms with McGonagall, showing a certain level of personal friendship. \n\n{{Quote|Coward! COWARD!|Minerva's fury towards Snape after duelling him|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\nAfter Snape killed Dumbledore, McGonagall was shocked and perhaps personally hurt to find her formerly-respected colleague a murderer and apparent traitor. When Snape became Headmaster of Hogwarts, she opposed him and his supposed minions the Carrows, without knowing Snape was secretly helping her protect the students from his fellow [[Death Eaters]]. At the onset of the Battle of Hogwarts, McGonagall and Snape duelled inconclusively; with [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]]'s later help, and Snape fled the school rather than continue the fight. McGonagall, believing his retreat was motivated by fear, called out \"Coward!\", an insult he particularly detested. Snape was killed by Voldemort during the battle, but she learnt that Snape had killed Dumbledore in a painful act of loyalty to the Headmaster's own orders too late. Following a private conversation with Harry, Minerva later took the controversial decision to add a portrait of Severus Snape to the gallery of old headmasters and headmistresses in her tower office. There is no report that she objected this, which shows that she likely forgave him and came to admire his marvellous bravery.\n\n===Pomona Sprout===\n{{Dialogue a-b-c|Flitwick|Nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.|Sprout|But we can hold him up.|McGonagall|Thank you Pomona|[[Filius Flitwick]], [[Pomona Sprout]], and Minerva just before the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\n[[File:Professor Sprout.jpg|259x259px|thumb|left|[[Pomona Sprout]], her longtime friend and colleague]]\nThe relationship between Professor McGonagall and [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] dates back to when both attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name=\"shortstories\" /> The two students maintained an excellent relationship, which was kept well into their adulthood.\n\nWhen [[Dolores Umbridge]] stood to speak during the [[1995]] [[Welcoming Feast]] after her introduction by [[Headmaster]] [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], the two professors were both taken aback at this, and even exchange glances of disapproval.<ref name=\"OOTP\" /> During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] on [[2 May]], [[1998]], Minerva and Pomona had the same views on protecting the Castle against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Death Eaters]].<ref name=\"DH30\">{{DH|B|30}}</ref>\n\n===Sybill Trelawney===\n{{Dialogue a-b|Sybill Trelawney|Certainly I knew, Minerva.

The only reason Minerva has never spoken ill of Sybill directly was due to her refusal to insult her colleagues.<ref name=\"POA\" />\n\nDespite her dislike for Trelawney and her teachings, Minerva was still disgusted when [[Dolores Umbridge|Umbridge]] unceremoniously and cruelly sacked Sybill. They would grow to understand one another through their shared hatred of Dolores Umbridge during the woman's tenure as [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] Professor. Minerva was there as a literal shoulder for Sybill to cry on, speaking out against Dolores and told her what she thought after the events.<ref name=\"OOTP\" />\n\n===Hogwarts staff===\n{{Dialogue a-b-c|Filius Flitwick|I suppose you are aware that nothing we do can indefinitely prevent [[Tom Riddle|You-Know-Who]] to enter the school, right? \u2014|Pomona Sprout|But we can delay it. \u2014|McGonagall|Thank you, [[Pomona Sprout|Pomona]].|McGonagall's interaction with other members of staff|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\n\n[[File:Harry Potter Movie Pictures-Professors.jpg|241x241px|thumb|Minerva with some of her colleagues]]\nMcGonagall seemed to have a good relationship with most of her co-workers at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Among them was [[Filius Flitwick]]. Their fellow [[Hatstall]] status was a subject of gentle humour between them, with the two Heads of house being amused to think that they might, but for those crucial moments in their youths, have exchanged positions. Flitwick fought alongside McGonagall in the  the upstart of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].\n[[File:Flitwickmainimage.jpg|265x265px|thumb|alt=|[[Filius Flitwick]], her friend and colleague]]\nMcGonagall was friendly with [[Poppy Pomfrey]], the nurse. Pomfrey seemed to admire McGonagall's magical abilities and strength. This was shown when McGonagall was hit by four Stunners on the chest, as Madam Pomfrey said that it would have killed most witches of her age.\n\nMcGonagall was friendly with [[Argus Filch]], the caretaker, although they argued many times. During the Battle of Hogwarts, she shouted at Filch, and called him a blithering idiot. Then she sternly ordered him to call [[Peeves]]. It is possible that, after the war, McGonagall and Filch were still co-workers.\n\nMinerva was on amicable terms with [[Horace Slughorn]], her former Potions professor. However, she commented on his seemingly cowardly behaviour when he realised the castle was under attack, noting he should take his students and do so if he wished to leave. She said that the two would duel to kill if he attempted to hinder their efforts against Voldemort from inside the castle, stating that it was time for Slytherin to finally choose their alliances. He was taken aback at this and he fled, but later returned with reinforcements of students' parents and residents of Hogsmeade to help with the battle efforts. Both Minerva and Horace battled together against Voldemort alongside Kingsley Shacklebolt in the Battle of Hogwarts.[[File:Gilderoy Lockhart COS promo.jpg|240x240px|thumb|[[Gilderoy Lockhart]]]]\nOn the other hand, Minerva had no liking for [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] whatsoever, the D.A.D.A professor before Lupin. This was due to him being obnoxious, incompetent and insensitive, annoying her with nonsensical advices while being ignorant and unhelpful around the second opening of the Chamber of Secrets. Even as a student, Lockhart was already a vain, annoying attention-seeking troublemaker, to which she held in contempt. Minerva was positively hateful towards Lockhart when he walked in late and oblivious when everyone else was greatly saddened at [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley's]] impending doom. She full-heartedly supported Snape sending Lockhart to deal with the monster within in the hopes of scaring her incompetent colleague away. When Lockhart resigned due to his self-induced amnesia, McGonagall was cheerful along with the rest of the staff and students at the news.\n\nAfter Voldemort infiltrated Hogwarts, two new professors took the post of [[Muggle Studies]] and [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]: [[Alecto Carrow|Alecto]] and [[Amycus Carrow]] respectively. They were loyal Death Eaters, and befitting their status, they taught Dark Arts rather than Defence Against the Dark Arts, devoted [[Muggle Studies]] to explaining how Muggles were filthy animals, and often took delight in punishing students with the [[Cruciatus Curse]]. When Amycus spat on McGonagall's face, Harry Potter got very angry and hit him with the Cruciatus Curse. After the war, McGonagall sent the Carrows to [[Azkaban]].\n\n===Order of the Phoenix members===\n[[File:Order of the Phoenix.png|251x251px|thumb|The original [[Order of the Phoenix]]]]\nMcGonagall had a good relationship with most members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. Some of them included [[Nymphadora Tonks]] and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], whom she appeared to be friendly with Kingsley. They fought Voldemort, along with [[Horace Slughorn]], and all of them survived the war. \n\nOther fellow member was [[Alastor Moody]], who was appointed as [[Defence Against the Dark Arts|DADA]] professor in 1994. However, he was captured by [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] and [[Peter Pettigrew]]; Barty Crouch was disguised as Moody and became the professor, as he wanted to send [[Harry Potter]] to Voldemort. McGonagall was very angry by Crouch's teaching methods and shouted at him. It is possible that she had the same opinion of the real Moody, but Moody might have been friendly with McGonagall afterwards. He was killed by Voldemort during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]].\n\n===Lord Voldemort===\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Minerva McGonagall|As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone \u2014|Albus Dumbledore|My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name?

Like most in the Wizarding world, Minerva was very wary of speaking Voldemort's name.<ref name=\"PS\" />\n\nDuring his second rise to power, Minerva joined the [[Order of the Phoenix]] and stayed in Hogwarts during the tenure of [[Severus Snape]] as [[Headmaster]] and the Carrows to protect her students. She was one of the few people that was not afraid of standing against the Carrows, as she did defy them many times during the 1997-1998 school year. In spite of her well-known loyalty to Professor Dumbledore, Voldemort and his followers believed that Minerva was both too gifted to lose, and too sensible not to join them fully once their victory was assured. However, she proved him wrong when she defended the school against his army and, along with [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] and [[Horace Slughorn]], bravely duelled Voldemort himself during the second part of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. She watched as Voldemort was defeated by [[Harry Potter]] once and for all, finally ending the War.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\n===Dolores Umbridge===\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Minerva McGonagall|He has achieved high marks in all his [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] tests \u2014|Dolores Umbridge|I'm terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me \u2014|I should have made my meaning plainer, He has achieved high marks in all Defence Against the Dark Arts tests set by a competent teacher.|Minerva insulting Dolores Umbridge|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n[[File:Dolores_Umbridge_Deathly_Hallows_promotional_image.jpg|218x218px|thumb|[[Dolores Umbridge]], her enemy and former colleague]]\nMinerva disliked Dolores Umbridge right from the beginning when the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher began to invade Hogwarts with her [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor]] position and did everything she could in her power to circumvent Umbridge's authority without risking the loss of her job. She was the colleague whom she had more violently clashed with than any other colleague in her long and varied career. During Umbridge's inspections of McGonagall's class, Minerva tried for the most part to ignore Umbridge. This was difficult due to Umbridge's constant interruptions by means Umbridge's soft, girlish cough of \"''Hem hem''\". When forced to acknowledge Umbridge's presence, McGonagall treated her with a cold and harsh demeanour.<ref name=\"OOTP\" />\n\nDespite Umbridge having the power to put Minerva on probation or even sack her, Minerva was not afraid to show her disgust and hatred of Umbridge to the woman's face. Despite this, she understood that Umbridge had a lot of power and that she was reporting directly to [[Cornelius Fudge]], and so Minerva once warned [[Harry Potter]] to tread carefully around Umbridge. Even so, Minerva vehemently vouched for Harry during their [[Careers Advice|Career Advice]] session, claiming that she would coach him nightly if she had to in order to realise his dream of becoming an [[Auror]], after Umbridge's furious protests that Harry would never become one. After Umbridge fired [[Sybill Trelawney]] from her post as [[Divination]] teacher, Minerva even put aside her mild dislike of Sybill to focus even more on her hatred of Umbridge, indirectly stating that the latter's evaluation is incompetent and will not be taken into consideration.<ref name=\"OOTP\" />\n\n[[File:Disloyalty Minerva Dolores.jpg|240px|thumb|left|Dolores Umbridge arguing with Minerva McGonagall]]\nEven when Dolores took over Hogwarts, replacing [[Albus Dumbledore]] as Head of the school, Minerva continued to help undermine Umbridge's reign, preferring to watch her struggle with the chaos that was being caused by the students and [[Peeves]] (and sometimes even helping with it). When Minerva was attacked and sent to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]], Dolores was pleased that she at last had complete control of Hogwarts. After she returned to Hogwarts, Minerva did nothing to curb the students' enthusiasm when Peeves chased Dolores from Hogwarts, only lamenting that she could not watch with them because the poltergeist had taken her walking stick to hit Dolores with as he followed her from the school.<ref name=\"OOTP\" /> Umbridge returned to the Ministry in a high-ranking position and interrogated Muggle-borns, capturing them and imprisoning them to [[Azkaban]]. However, after the Second Wizarding War, Umbridge was captured by Aurors and sent to Azkaban herself, for the rest of her life.\n\nDespite their hatred for each other, both McGonagall and Umbridge share the same [[Patronus Charm|patronus]]: a cat, although McGonagall's resembled her Animagus form.\n\n==Media==\n<gallery width=\"200\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nFile:Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 - McGonagall sends the Slytherin students away (HD)|McGonagall Sends the Slytherins Away \nFile:Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 - ''Boom'' and Piertotum Locomotor scene (HD)|Hogwarts is Threatened\n</gallery>\n\n==Etymology==\n*The name ''Minerva'' means \"wise\". Minerva is the Roman name of Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom, strategy, war, courage, and justice (among other things), which is a name suitable for Minerva's personality. Also, Minerva was the goddess of wisdom, schools, art and commerce, which could connect to her being one of the heads of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].\n*''McGonagall'' comes from the Scotsman William Topaz McGonagall, who is considered to be one of the worst poets in the English language, although Rowling stated that this has nothing to do with Minerva, she only liked the surname. The Scottish name McGonagall (or McGonigle, McGonegal) is from the Celtic name Conegal, meaning \"the bravest\", plus Mc, or \"son of\".\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:MinervaMcGonagall WB F1 MinervaMcGonagallRobeIllustration Illust 080615 Port.jpg|217x217px|thumb|McGonagall as she appears on {{PM}}]]\n[[File:McGonagallWU.png|120px|thumb|McGonagall as she appears in {{WU}}]]\n[[File:Minerva DHP2.jpg|thumb|Minerva in {{DH|F2}}]]\n[[File:Minerva McGonagall - PAS.png|140px|thumb|Minerva McGonagall as seen in {{PAS}}]]\n[[File:Mcgonagall_pop.jpg|thumb|Minerva as a [[POP!

She also provided McGonagall's voice in {{HM}}.<ref>https://twitter.com/HogwartsMystery/status/981864182957166597</ref> Despite being from Essex, her late mother was from Glasgow, so Smith may had picked up that accent, but is less pronounced.\n**In 2007, Dame Maggie Smith was diagnosed with breast cancer and struggled through the filming of Half Blood Prince (2008) while undergoing the chemo treatments. In 2009, during the filming of Deathly Hallows: Part 2 she developed shingles (a painful skin rash), but still continued the film despite the pain.\n**From August 2017 onwards, Maggie Smith is the oldest cast member still living in the series, after the death of [[Robert Hardy]] (born [[1925]]), who played [[Cornelius Fudge]].\n*McGonagall's [[Tabby Cat]] [[Animagus]] appearance is portrayed in the first instalment by [[Mrs P. Head|Mrs P. Head]].\n*A younger Minerva McGonagall is portrayed by [[Fiona Glascott]] in {{COG}}.\n**Previously, on [[Harry Potter Wiki]] and [[Harry Potter Lexicon]], McGonagall's year of birth was calculated to be 1935 from her {{PM}} biography and {{OOTP|B|15}}, which reveals she began Hogwarts in December 1956 after working for the Ministry for two years immediately after graduation. This places her graduation in 1954, her first year in 1947, and her birth in 1935, because of her October birthday, she was almost 12 when starting at Hogwarts. Furthermore, her{{PM}} piece states that she was a student of Dumbledore when he taught Transfiguration (\"under the guidance of her inspirational Transfiguration teacher, Albus Dumbledore. It also states that Dumbledore employed her when he was still Head of the Transfiguration department and that she worked under him when he was Head of the department (\"offering her a job in the Transfiguration department, under Head of Department, Albus Dumbledore\").\n***However, in {{COG}}, Albus and Minerva were presented as basically being a contemporary and Dumbledore taught Defence Against the Dark Arts first, meaning he couldn't have taught her Transfiguration. Hence, McGonagall's appearance in {{COG}} greatly upset certain fans and generated debates on the matter. In order to force it to work, she (and Dumbledore) have to switch back and forth implausibly in too short of a timeframe in their career, and it extensively ages [[Pomona Sprout]] (who had two overlapping school years with McGonagall) too. Theories have included:\n****McGonagall's comments to [[Dolores Umbridge]] in {{OOTP}}, where she says she had been working at the school for \"thirty-nine years\" never specified that she taught those thirty-nine years ''consecutively'', which was the assumption for the calculation to work. This could mean Minerva had been teaching as Head of the [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] Department for 39 years and not Hogwarts in general. In this case, it only contradicts Minerva's second statement that she had started as transfiguration professor \"after working for the Ministry for two years immediately after graduation.\"<ref name=\"OOTP\" />\n*****It is also possible that she took a break in her career at some point in her life like [[Horace Slughorn]] or she was in fact outright lying to Dolores Umbridge about her real length of employment at Hogwarts.\n****There is also the possibility that there was another, older Scottish witch of the same name who also taught at Hogwarts before the birth of the Minerva who appears in the Harry Potter books and films, although it would be unlikely that the two are related as the latter inherited her surname from her Muggle father.<ref name=\"shortstories\" />\n****Another possible theory is the idea of [[Time-Turner|time travel]] as this concept has been explored in {{CC}}, where [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus Potter]] and [[Scorpius Malfoy]] get stranded in the [[1981]] timeline but were successfully able to summon their parents back from the [[2020|present]] to save them. Similarly, there is a possibility that McGonagall travelled back to the early 1910s to fill in [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s previous (or intended) position in [[Transfiguration]], so Dumbledore could instead teach [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] thus better preparing his students for the [[Global wizarding war|war]] to come. If so, it is likely that Dumbledore was able to summon a professor back from the future (which happened to be McGonagall) to fill in the post by sending a out message to her future self in a [[Harry Potter's blanket|similar manner]] like what was used by Albus Severus to summon [[Harry Potter|Harry]]. Also, in ''the Cursed Child'', she later expresses her disgust about time turners and their consequences towards Albus Severus and Scorpius due to their reckless use of one and towards [[Hermione Granger]] due to not destroying that. This may also be attributed to a bad experience she had back in those days when using it.\n*[[J. K. Rowling]] stated that she always pictured [[Maggie Smith]], who portrays her in the films, as Professor McGonagall.\n*Professor McGonagall has the distinction of being the first magical character introduced in the series, when [[Vernon Dursley]] sees her reading a map in her Animagus form on the morning after the Potters' deaths. Only the three Dursleys are introduced before her. However in the films, McGonagall is the second magical character introduced as [[Albus Dumbledore]] appears before her. She is the second overall character introduced in the film series, as well as the first female character introduced.\n*In the films, McGonagall appears to be older than she is described in the books. The timeline suggests that the character was forty-six when she and Dumbledore left Harry with the Dursleys, was fifty-five when Harry started Hogwarts, and sixty-two by the Battle of Hogwarts. By contrast, Maggie Smith was already in her late sixties at the time that she first played McGonagall.\n*In the film adaptations, it seems to be a recurring gag to have Minerva delivering alliterative lines; for instance, in ''Goblet of Fire'', she says \"behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons\", and in ''Deathly Hallows: Part 2'', she says \"particular proclivity for pyrotechnics\".\n*In {{POA|FA}} there is a painting of a young Minerva McGonagall on the Gryffindor common room wall. The same painting, although in a different frame, can be seen hung at the Grand Staircase interacting with [[Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]].\n*In {{HBP|FA}} she led the respectful wand raising to rid the sky of the dark mark from the late Dumbledore's body.\n*In {{DH|F2}}, after casting ''[[Piertotum Locomotor]]'', Minerva excitedly says to Molly Weasley, \"''I've always wanted to use that spell!''\"\n*In {{DH|F2}}, before the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], she tells [[Filius Flitwick]] not be afraid to say [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s name, because he will try to kill him either way. Also before the Battle of Hogwarts, she duels Snape with what appears to be the [[Blasting Curse]], defeating Amycus and Alecto Carrow before Snape Disapparates.\n*Minerva is partly inspired by [[J. K. Rowling]]'s inspirational English teacher Lucy Shepherd, who taught her what a good book looks like.\n*In an early draft of the first book, she was called \"Madam McGonagle\".\n*Minerva was the first Animagus introduced in canon.\n*She was the first female character confirmed to have kept her maiden surname when she married. Later, it was revealed that [[Hermione Granger]] also did.\n*In an interview after the publication of {{DH}}, [[J. K. Rowling]] had stated that Hogwarts had [[Marazion|a different Head]] by the time Harry Potter's children arrived in 2017, saying that Minerva was \"getting on a bit\".<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0726-today-vieira1.html JK Rowling One-On-One: Part One.
