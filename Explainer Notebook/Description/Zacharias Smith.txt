"{{Individual infobox\n|theme = hufflepuff\n|image = [[File:WB F5 Dumbledores army smith.jpg]]\n|name = Zacharias Smith\n|born = Between [[2 September]] [[1979]] and [[1 September]] [[1983]]<ref>It is never stated in the book what year Smith is in. Since he was on Quidditch team in the [[1995\u20131996 school year]], he was at least 12 years old on 1 September 1995; and since he was still attending Hogwarts for the [[1997\u20131998 school year]], he was at most \"1 day to 18 years old\" on 1 September 1997. There are speculations that Smith was at least 17 years old on 2 May 1998, since he was fleeing from the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], and under-age wizards and witches were instructed to leave. This would put his date of birth before [[2 May]] [[1981]]. However, it was also argued that his fleeing could simply be an indication of his fear at the time, or simply that he was in the queue in the first place because he was underage.</ref><ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0700-swns-alfie.htm 2000 interview with J.

Since [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s [[Muggle-Repelling Charm|are not given access to Hogwarts]], and because Zacharias shares a surname with a descendant of [[Helga Hufflepuff]], it is mostly likely that he comes from a wizarding family.

[[1979]]/[[1981]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], who was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into and a member of [[Hufflepuff]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]]. He was a [[Chaser]] on the [[Hufflepuff Quidditch team]] and a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation taught and led by [[Harry Potter]].<ref name=\"OOTP16\">{{OOTP|B|16}}</ref> On [[2 May]] [[1998]], he abandoned the D.A. instead of fighting with them during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].<ref name=\"DH31\" />\n\n[[Ronald Weasley]] detested him as soon as they met, mostly because of his insolent and cynical attitude while talking to the [[trio]], and his disloyalty towards [[Harry Potter]] and Hogwarts.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nZacharias was born into the [[Smith family]], most likely between 1979 and 1981 in Great Britain or Ireland.\n\n===Hogwarts years {{C|1990s}}===\nZacharias probably started his education at Hogwarts in either [[1992]] or [[1993]]. During the [[Welcoming Feast]], Zacharias was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into the house of [[Hufflepuff]] and it is possible he shared a dormitory with [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], and [[Wayne Hopkins]]. Zacharias did not fit the normal Hufflepuff sorting, as he showed selfishness, disloyalty, and cowardice, while most Hufflepuffs are  loyal and kind.\n\n====1995\u20131996 school year====\n{{Quote|All [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] told us last year was that [[Cedric Diggory]] got killed by You-Know-Who and that you brought Diggory\u2019s body back to Hogwarts.

[[Hermione Granger]] eventually regretted inviting him, as he was annoyingly and constantly sceptical. He did not stop his continuous criticism at the [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]] meeting until [[Fred and George Weasley]] threatened him with a ''\"long and lethal-looking metal instrument.\"''<ref name=\"OOTP16\" />\n\n[[File:Smith DA meeting.jpg|250px|thumb|Zacharias at a D.A. meeting, standing next to Neville Longbottom]]\nSmith was also openly critical of [[Harry Potter]]'s leadership abilities, such as when he scoffed at Harry's decision to teach them ''[[Disarming Charm|Expelliarmus]]'', which prompted Harry to point out that it had saved him when he duelled with [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], and that Zacharias was free to leave at any time.<ref name=\"OOTP18\">{{OOTP|B|18}}</ref> He also  openly mocked Harry when he believed him to be taking remedial [[Potions (class)|Potions]], due to Harry's private lessons with [[Severus Snape]] to learn [[Occlumency]].<ref name=\"OOTP24\">{{OOTP|B|24}}</ref> However, after the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' announced that ten [[Death Eaters]] had [[Azkaban escapes#1996|escaped]] from [[Azkaban]], Smith worked much harder, along with the other D.A. members.<ref name=\"OOTP25\">{{OOTP|B|25}}</ref> He later played in the Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff Quidditch match, beating Gryffindor by ten points.<ref name=\"OOTP26\">{{OOTP|B|26}}</ref>\n\n====1996\u20131997 school year====\n{{Quote|He saw me hex Zacharias Smith, you remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the DA?

The [[Potions Master]] [[Horace Slughorn]] witnessed this, but instead of giving Ginny detention, he invited her to the [[Slug Club]].<ref name=\"HBP7\">{{HBP|B|7}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Zac_smethfron.PNG|250px|thumb|left|Zacharias in the [[Hogwarts Library|library]] during likely his fourth or fifth year]]\nSmith earned more ire from [[Gryffindor]]s when he took over [[Lee Jordan]]'s former position as [[Quidditch]] commentator, along with [[Luna Lovegood]]. Among his offending statements was a claim that [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]'s friendship with [[Harry Potter]], the team captain, helped get him onto the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. When both Ginny and Ron proved themselves very capable players, Smith began making disparaging remarks about the new Gryffindor beaters instead. Smith was again on the bad end of Ginny's temper; after the match, she dive-bombed the podium where Smith was calling the match, and slammed into him. Ginny made an excuse to [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] saying that she forgot to brake.<ref name=\"HBP14\">{{HBP|B|14}}</ref> When Luna Lovegood commentated on Quidditch that same year, she speculated that Smith was suffering from [[Loser's Lurgy]].<ref name=\"OOTP19\">{{OOTP|B|19}}</ref>\n\nIn December, Hermione considered asking Smith to Horace Slughorn's [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]] instead of [[Cormac McLaggen]], as she knew that Ron loathed both boys, and wanted to get revenge for his relationship with [[Lavender Brown]]. Once in Slughorn's office, she told Harry and Luna that she wished she ''had'' chosen Smith; McLaggen talked about nothing but himself and was not at all a gentleman. Harry was revolted at the idea.<ref name=\"HBP15\">{{HBP|B|15}}</ref>\n\nWhen the school year ended in tragedy, Smith was not among the students who attended the [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|funeral]] of [[Albus Dumbledore]], instead leaving the day before with his haughty-looking [[Zacharias Smith's father|father]].<ref name=\"HBP30\">{{HBP|B|30}}</ref>\n\n====1997\u20131998 school year====\n{{Dialogue a-b|[[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]]|And what if we want to stay and fight?|[[Minerva McGonagall]]|If you are of age, you may stay.|Over-aged students were given a chance to defend the school before the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\n{{Quote|Harry saw Zacharias Smith bowling over first years to get to the front of the queue, here and there younger students were in tears, while older ones called desperately for friends or siblings.|Description of the evacuation before the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\nEven though he was a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], Smith did not help in the defence of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] when it was attacked by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s army in May of [[1998]]; this may indicate that he did not join the revived D.A. that faced considerably more danger in opposing the [[Carrow family|Carrow]] professors that year. Smith was last seen fleeing Hogwarts, rather than participating in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. He even pushed first-year students out of his way in his rush to leave.<ref name=\"DH31\">{{DH|B|31}}</ref> It is unknown if Smith survived the war, or what happened to him afterwards if he survived.\n\n==Physical appearance==\nZacharias Smith was described as a tall, skinny blond boy with an upturned nose.<ref name=\"OOTP16\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|That Zacharias bloke's a wart.|Zacharias's unpleasant personality|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\nZacharias Smith seemed to generally be a rather unpleasant person and was seen as overly critical of [[Harry Potter]] in the [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]]<ref name=\"OOTP16\" /> He was also pushy and insensitive in questioning [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] and rude and biased in his [[Quidditch]] commentary.<ref name=\"HBP14\" /> He was obnoxious, condescending, pessimistic, and a hypocritical ingrate. He failed to see flaws in himself and was constantly openly insulting people or pointing out exaggerated facts or opinions about said people. When he was part of [[Dumbledore's Army]], he obnoxiously criticised and challenged Harry's competence as a teacher as well as a wizard \u2014 he didn't seem to realise that he himself was doing terribly in general, as seen by his struggling with the [[Disarming Charm]] (though this might be due to the Weasley Twins' intervention).<ref name=\"OOTP18\" /> The main reason he attended the D.A. recruitment meeting was to hear details regarding [[Cedric Diggory]]'s death; even though Harry made it clear the meeting was not about such topics and that he has no intention of speaking of it, Smith pressed on the matter until Harry bluntly told him to stay down or leave.<ref name=\"OOTP16\" />\n\nAside from this lack of fair play, Smith also showed cowardice and a lack of the loyalty uncharacteristic of [[Hufflepuff]] house in fleeing, instead of fighting for his school and fellow students in their time of greatest need. He was so selfish that he went as far as to forcefully rush through [[first year]]s in his great haste to escape.<ref name=\"DH31\" /> He did not stay for the late headmaster [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's funeral]], instead leaving the moment his \"haughty-looking\" father came to pick him up.<ref name=\"HBP30\" />\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Zacharias joined the [[Hufflepuff Quidditch team]], playing as a [[Chaser]], implying he was a reasonably skilled and talented [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player.<ref name=\"OOTP26\" />\n*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': In [[1995]], he reluctantly and cynically joined [[Dumbledore's Army]] and therefore would have learned to cast various defensive and offensive [[spell]]s and how to [[Duelling|duel]] with [[martial magic]], under the expertise teaching of [[Harry Potter]]. However, his overall performance during the lessons was far from exemplary, as he had difficulty casting the [[Disarming Charm]],<ref name=\"OOTP18\" /> although he did try much harder after it was announced several [[Death Eaters]] had [[Azkaban escapes|escaped]] from [[Azkaban]],<ref name=\"OOTP26\" /> meaning that he likely improved his skills.\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Zacharias was capable of producing a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]],<ref name=\"LEGOY2\" /> a highly advanced and difficult piece of [[magic]], which he likely learnt how to cast in Dumbledore's Army.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Zacharias is a variant of ''[[Wikipedia:Zechariah (given name)|Zechariah]]'', a Hebrew name meaning \"God has remembered\" (this was probably a misnomer for Zacharias). This was the name of the father of John the Baptist. He and his wife were very old when they had John, and Zechariah was initially disbelieving when an angel informed them they would have a son; as punishment for his doubt, he was struck mute. This may allude to Zacharias Smith's scepticism.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Dean Thomas, Zacharias Smith and others DHF2.png|thumb|A possible Zacharias Smith standing behind Dean and seeing Voldemort announce Harry's \"death\" in {{DH|F2}}]]\n*In the closing credits of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', [[Nick Shirm]] is identified as \"Somewhat Doubtful Boy\", rather than by name. Shirm also voiced the character in the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|video game]], where he is explicitly identified as Zacharias.\n*Zacharias Smith seems to be more pleasant in the movies than in the novels, like for example in {{OOTP|FA}}, he cheered on Fred and George for their fireworks departure, he congratulates [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] for disarming [[Padma Patil|Padma]], and before the Christmas holidays began, he happily applauded Harry's Dumbledore's Army lessons.\n*Zacharias Smith may be [[Smith family|related]] to [[Hepzibah Smith]], and therefore possibly a descendant of [[Helga Hufflepuff]], founder of his [[Hufflepuff|house]] at Hogwarts. Should this be true, Zacharias would be an odd irony compared to his ancestor Hufflepuff, lacking loyalty and fair play - this would explain, though, why someone that did not carry many Hufflepuff traits would still be Sorted into that house, as he could have requested to be put in Hufflepuff.\n*It could also be that, since Helga Hufflepuff would take students that were not picked by the other founders, the Sorting Hat sensed that Smith didn't possess any of the qualities needed for the other houses and put him in Hufflepuff by default.\n*In {{DH|F2}}, he is possibly seen standing in the courtyard, witnessing [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] announcing Harry's apparent [[death]], suggesting that, unlike in the novel, he ''did'' fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in the film.\n*Zacharias Smith may be named for another fantasy figure, [http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/Doctor_Zachary_Smith Doctor Zachary Smith] of Lost In Space. Doctor Smith was also known for cowardice, selfishness, and being quick to cast aspersions.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Zacharias Smith}}\n*{{OOTP}} {{1st}}\n*{{OOTP|F}}\n*{{OOTP|G}}\n*{{HBP}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{Possible}} {{Voice}}\n*{{DH}}\n*{{DH|F2}} {{Possible}}\n*{{PM}}\n*{{WW}}\n*{{QWC}} \n*{{LEGO|Y2}}\n*''[[Harry Potter: The Wand Collection]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=[[Lee Jordan]]\n|position=Hogwarts Quidditch Commentator\n|years=[[1996]]\n|successor=[[Luna Lovegood]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n{{Dumbledore's Army}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Smith, Zacharias}}\n\n[[de:Zacharias Smith]]\n[[es:Zacharias Smith]]\n[[fi:Zacharias Smith]]\n[[fr:Zacharias Smith]]\n[[nl:Zacharias Smid]]\n[[pl:Zachariasz Smith]]\n[[pt-br:Zacarias Smith]]\n[[ru:\u0417\u0430\u0445\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0421\u043c\u0438\u0442]]\n[[ja:\u30b6\u30ab\u30ea\u30a2\u30b9\u30fb\u30b9\u30df\u30b9]]\n[[zh:\u624e\u5361\u8d56\u65af\u00b7\u53f2\u5bc6\u65af]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Chasers]]\n[[Category:Dumbledore's Army defectors]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts Quidditch Captains]]\n[[Category:Hufflepuffs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Quidditch commentators]]\n[[Category:Smith family|Zacharias]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
