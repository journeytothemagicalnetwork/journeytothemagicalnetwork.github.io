She was initially sceptical, saying that Harry \"''always seemed so nice''\", but was eventually convinced by her friend Ernie Macmillan that Harry was the one that had attacked [[Muggle-born]] students around Hogwarts, including her housemate and friend [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], which didn't go down well with Hannah, unsettling her.<ref name=\"COS11\">{{COS|B|11}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hufflepuffs in Transfiguration class.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hannah during a second year Transfiguration lesson]]\n\nWhen Hermione was attacked by the [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk]], Ernie and Hannah apologised, knowing Harry would never harm her.

Hannah was among the many Hufflepuffs who were displeased when Harry appeared to be usurping Cedric's rightful place, by becoming the second [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] champion during the Triwizard Tournament, and she showed support only for her fellow Hufflepuff.<ref name=\"GOF19\">{{GOF|B|19}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-Hannah_&_Ernie.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hannah with Ernie watching the Third Task of the tournament]]\n\nThis was because [[Hufflepuff]] never received much attention, and she, along with many others, felt Harry was taking the glory away from Diggory.<ref name=\"GOF19\"/> To show her support, she wore a ''Support CEDRIC DIGGORY \u2014 the REAL Hogwarts Champion!'' badge that was able to change to read ''POTTER STINKS''.<ref name=\"GOFF 14\">{{GOF|F}} - Chapter 14 (''Ferret Boy'')</ref>\n\nAgain, as in her [[second year]], Hannah spent a lot of her free time revising in the [[Great Hall]] with Ernie Macmillan, presumably studying for her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] which were coming up the following year.

She applied for the job of Matron at Hogwarts. On [[8 July]] [[2014]], [[Rita Skeeter]] scathingly reported that she and Neville enjoyed \"''a little more Ogden's Firewhisky than most would expect from custodians of our children''\".<ref name=\"QWCfinal\">[[DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP FINAL]] (Archived)</ref> Since Rita enjoyed fabricating information to slander people, it is likely that her statement is untrue.\n\n==Physical description==\nHannah was described as a pink-faced girl with blonde hair. In her younger years, she usually wore pigtails.<ref name=\"hair&skin\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nHannah appeared to have a naive streak since she was easily convinced by Ernie that Harry might be the [[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]], despite having always considered him to be nice.<ref name=\"COS11\"/> She also believed that [[Sirius Black]] could turn into a flowering shrub (although, given that he was, in fact, an [[Animagus]], the belief wasn't too far from the truth).<ref name=\"POA9\"/>\n\nHannah was easily flustered and appeared to lack self-confidence, as was evidenced by her breakdown in [[Herbology]] and her claims of being stupid.<ref name=\"OOTP27\"/> It seemed that, when under pressure, she was prone to making mistakes.<ref name=\"ootp31\"/> Despite this, Hannah was a loyal friend and showed her bravery firstly by joining [[Dumbledore's Army]],<ref name=\"OOTP16\" /> and then fighting in the defence of Hogwarts.<ref name=\"DH31\"/>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Hannah joined [[Dumbledore's Army]] in her [[fifth year]],<ref name=\"OOTP16\"/> and learned how to cast various defensive and offensive [[spell]]s, under the masterful teaching of [[Harry Potter]].<ref name=\"OOTP38\"/>\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': Hannah helped retaliate against [[Draco Malfoy]] and his [[Draco Malfoy's gang|friends]] when they tried to gang up on and attack Harry Potter, where she and her friends managed to [[jinx]] and [[hex]] them into having the appearances of [[slug]]s.<ref name=\"OOTP38\"/> She also impressively fought in and survived the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], showing her to have been an excellent duellist with considerable proficiency in [[martial magic]].<ref name=\"DH31\"/><ref name=\"DH36\"/>\n*'''[[Herbology]]''': Hannah achieved a high mark on her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] exam, and in her [[sixth year]] she attended N.E.W.T. Herbology classes, showing her proficiency in the subject.<ref name=\"HBP11\" />\n*'''[[Healing magic]]''': In her adulthood, Hannah trained to become a [[Healer]] and applied for the position of the Hogwarts [[Matron]], meaning she would have been very accomplished and learned in healing magic, including with [[healing spell]]s, [[potion]]s and other magical remedies.<ref name=\"QWCfinal\"/>\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Hannah was capable of conjuring a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]],<ref name=\"LEGOY2\"/> a mark of superior [[magic]]al ability given how difficult the said charm is to perform. She likely learned how to cast the spell whilst attending Dumbledore's Army meetings.\n\n==Possessions==\n*'''[[Wand]]''': Hannah owned a wand, which was of an unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] material. Like most witches and wizards in [[Great Britain]], she presumably purchased it from [[Ollivanders]] in [[Diagon Alley]], [[London]], prior to starting her [[first year]] at Hogwarts in [[1991]]. She would have wielded her wand throughout her school life, and during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]].\n*'''[[Leaky Cauldron]]''': After graduating from Hogwarts, Hannah eventually become the Landlady of the Leaky Cauldron, the popular wizarding pub in Diagon Alley, thus becoming its owner.\n*'''[[Prefect badge]]''': Hannah owned a Hufflepuff Prefect badge, prior to becoming a [[Prefect]] at the start of the [[1995\u20131996 school year]], which she would have worn during her Prefect duties.\n*'''[[Potter Stinks badge]]''': At the start of the [[Triwizard Tournament]] in [[1994]], Hannah owned and wore one of these enchanted badges to show her contempt for Harry Potter becoming the second Hogwarts champion, believing he was stealing [[Cedric Diggory]]'s limelight. She stopped wearing hers after becoming a supporter of Harry during the Tournament.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Neville Longbottom===\n[[File:Neville Longbottom.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Neville Longbottom]], her future husband]]\nAlthough it appeared that Hannah and Neville Longbottom were rarely ever together during their school days, and given that Hannah supported [[Cedric Diggory]] in their fourth year, their friendship probably evolved from their time in [[Dumbledore's Army]] together, and during the student rebellion during their seventh year, as well as just being in the same year and sharing classes for so long \u2014 particularly [[Herbology]], Neville's best subject, which the [[Gryffindor]]s shared with the [[Hufflepuff]]s.\n\nIt is possible that Hannah and Neville both found comfort in each other during their seventh year, since in the previous year Hannah's mother had been killed by [[Death Eaters]], and Neville would understand how she would be feeling as Death Eaters tortured his parents into [[insanity]]. Hannah joined Dumbledore's Army under the leadership of Neville, and in the absence of Harry, and proved her loyalty to him throughout the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].\n\nFollowing the [[Second Wizarding War]], Hannah and Neville became closer and eventually married. Neville became the new Professor of Herbology at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], taking over from [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]], whilst Hannah became the new landlady of the [[Leaky Cauldron]], taking over from [[Tom]]. The couple lived together above the pub, a fact that Neville's students thought was \"cool\".<ref name=\"CH\" />\n\nHannah eventually applied for the job of Matron at Hogwarts, which could have brought her closer to Neville, if she managed to gain the position.\n\n===Ernie Macmillan===\n[[File:Louis-Doyle-Ernie-Macmillan.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], her friend and house mate]]\nHannah and Ernie Macmillan were close friends during their time at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], both having been sorted into the house of [[Hufflepuff]] during their first year. During their second year they both discussed the possibility of Harry being the Heir of [[Slytherin]] after the Chamber of Secrets had been declared open. Hannah had her doubts, as she thought Harry was nice, but Ernie was easily able to sway her opinion.<ref name=\"COS11\" />\n\nBoth Hannah and Ernie shared the hobby of collecting [[Chocolate Frog Card]]s.<ref name=\"GOF19\"/> They also both supported [[Cedric Diggory]] as the School Champion during the [[Triwizard Tournament]], as many Hufflepuffs and even Ravenclaws did, and both shared a certain irritation with Harry Potter, the other champion.<ref name=\"GOF19\" /> In [[1995]], they both became the [[Hufflepuff]] [[prefect]]s<ref name=\"OOTP10\"/> and joined [[Dumbledore's Army]].<ref name=\"OOTP16\"/> Unlike Hannah, Ernie was able to keep his cool during his O.W.L.s.<ref name=\"ootp31\" />\n\n===Justin Finch-Fletchley===\nHannah and [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]] were close friends during their time at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], both having been sorted into the house of [[Hufflepuff]] during their first year. During their second year they both discussed the possibility of Harry being the Heir of [[Slytherin]] after the Chamber of Secrets had been declared open.<ref name=\"COS11\"/> Both Hannah and Justin joined [[Dumbledore's Army]].<ref name=\"OOTP16\" />\n\n===Susan Bones===\nHannah and [[Susan Bones|Susan]] were roommates and friends during Hogwarts, and sat together in the [[Hogwarts Express|train]] while going to Hogwarts.<ref name=\"DHF1\"/> Both joined [[Dumbledore's Army]] and both fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].\n\n==Etymology==\n*\"Hannah\" is from the Hebrew name \u05d7\u05b7\u05e0\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4 (Channah) which meant \"favour\" or \"grace\". Hannah was the mother of the prophet Samuel in the Old Testament. As an English name, Hannah was not regularly used until after the Protestant Reformation.<ref>http://www.behindthename.com/name/hannah</ref>\n\n:*\"Hannah\" sounds almost identical to the Japanese word for flower, \u82b1 (romanised \"Hana\"). As such, it could be taken as part of the pattern of flower names, which includes [[Lily J. Potter]], [[Lily L. Potter]], [[Rose Granger-Weasley]], [[Fleur Delacour]], [[Petunia Evans]] and others. However, it is very likely that this is simply a coincidence, given that the name is of Hebrew origin and means something else.\n*\"Abbott\" is a Middle English surname.<ref>http://www.wordnik.com/words/Abbott</ref> An abbot was a church position below the pope, archbishops and bishops in the Church hierarchy in the Middle Ages. The ancestors of people with the surname Abbott probably were abbots or abbesses in medieval times (900-1300).\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Da-hannah.jpg|150px|thumb|Hannah as she appears on {{PM}}]]\n*During the [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]], Hannah Abbott was doing her [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] practical at the same time as [[Harry Potter]]. This is odd as the examinations are done by surname, meaning that Hannah should have finished a while earlier. One possible explanation is that the lists for that examination were mistakenly compiled by first name. Another is that Hannah's exam took an unusually long time, possibly due to her nerves.<ref name=\"ootp31\"/>\n*[[Harry Potter]] and [[Hermione Granger]] saw the grave of someone named \"[[Abbott]]\" when they visited [[Godric's Hollow]] in [[1997]]. This may have been the grave of a relative of Hannah's, perhaps indicating that her [[Abbott family|family]], like the [[Potter family|Potters]], come from Godric's Hollow.\n*While Hannah's mother was revealed to be killed by the Death Eaters, her father's fate was left unknown, indicating that he was either alive or deceased by 1996. So, Hannah may have possibly been left an orphan after her mother's death. Alternatively, her father could have been the one who pulled her out of Hogwarts.\n[[File:Hannahabbott.PNG|150px|thumb|Hannah Abbott as she appears in the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|''Order of the Phoenix'' video game]]]]\n*Hannah Abbott was portrayed by [[Charlotte Skeoch]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]] of ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', as well as voicing the character for the game ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]''.
