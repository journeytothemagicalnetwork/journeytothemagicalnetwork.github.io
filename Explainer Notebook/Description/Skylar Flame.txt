Flame was in a study group with [[Margaretta Ironbark]] and [[Olin Oakwood]]. They pressured Olin to compete in the tournament, along with Margaretta. The competition got the best of them and turned them into grudging enemies. After he defeated them and won the tournament, their study group fell apart and each of them formed their own clubs, each one dedicated to the areas of study that suited them best.<ref name=\"HM5T\">{{HM|5|THE TOURNAMENT OF CLUBS}}</ref>\n\nAt some point, Flame wrote a historical manuscript that was entitled, ''\"[[Olin the Cheat]]\"''.
