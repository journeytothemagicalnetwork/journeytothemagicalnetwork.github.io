George's first few years were marked by the height of the [[First Wizarding War]] and [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s first fall.\n\nHe attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1989]]-[[1996]] with Fred, and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]. He and Fred were popular students, becoming [[Beater]]s for the Gryffindor [[Quidditch]] [[Quidditch team|team]] in their second year, and members of [[Dumbledore's Army]] in their unfinished seventh year. \n\nA born prankster and inventor, George left Hogwarts prior to graduation to become a successful entrepreneur, alongside his twin brother, and opened the joke shop [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] at [[93 Diagon Alley]]. He was a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] and fought in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]; in the latter, Fred died, leaving George devastated.\n\nSometime after the end of the [[Second Wizarding War|Second Wizarding]] war, George married [[Angelina Johnson]], with whom he had a son named [[Fred Weasley II|Fred]], in honour of his late twin, and a daughter named [[Roxanne Weasley|Roxanne]].

Although the family was poor, they were loving and happy.\n\nGeorge and Fred were troublemakers from a young age, delighting in playing clever pranks and in teasing their siblings (especially Percy), and it was a challenge for their mother to try to keep them under control.

He and his twin brother made very good friends with fellow Gryffindors [[Lee Jordan]], [[Angelina Johnson]], [[Alicia Spinnet]], and [[Oliver Wood]], and became well known for their senses of humour.

Harry joined the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] as its [[Seeker]], and became friendly with George and Fred as well. For Christmas, Harry received a [[Weasley family|Weasley]] jumper along with George, Fred, Ron, and their other brother Percy. The twins' jumpers had their initials on them, prompting George to quip that they knew they were \"Gred and Forge\".<ref name=\"PS\" /> George also insisted that his older brother [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] wear his jumper and sit with his brothers instead of the other [[Prefect]]s, reminding him that the Christmas holidays were a time for family.<ref name=\"PS\" />\n\nHe, along with the rest of the family, was immensely proud of Ron when the latter beat [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]'s giant chess set. George was also on the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] that had the worst loss in 300 years in the Quidditch final without Harry as Seeker because of his encounter with [[Quirinus Quirrell]].

They pulled the bars off his window and flew him to the Burrow in their father's [[Flying Ford Anglia|Ford Anglia]]. While at the Burrow George and Fred came to know Harry better as they spent time flying with him. The twins soon began their fourth year at Hogwarts, and took to teasing their younger sister Ginny as she began her first year. They were trying to cheer her up, unaware that her emotional state was fragile due to the influence of [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|Tom Riddle's Diary]].\n\n[[File:Writing on wall students.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Fred, George, and others read the message about the opening of the Chamber of Secrets]]\n\nThat year, the Chamber of Secrets was opened and frightening messages were written on the castle walls. Rumours were circulating that Harry was responsible for it, since he spoke [[Parseltongue]] and thus might be the [[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]]. Neither George nor Fred took these rumours seriously, they found the whole thing laughable and frequently joked about it. They also came to [[Hermione Granger]]'s defence when [[Draco Malfoy]] called her a \"''filthy little [[Mudblood]]''\", lunging at him, only to be blocked by Captain [[Marcus Flint]].<ref name=\"COS\" /> \n\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;line-height:22px;\">George helped protect Harry form a rogue Bludger during Gryffindor's opening match against Slytherin.</span><span style=\"font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;line-height:22px;\"> </span>After Gryffindor won the Quidditch match, George went to the hospital wing with the rest of the Gryffindor Quidditch team to see Harry, because [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] had removed all his bones, and congratulated him for his unbelievable flying, but not before seeing Marcus Flint yelling at Draco Malfoy for \"''having the [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]] on top of his head and not noticing''\", of which he informed Harry.<ref name=\"COS\" /> At the end of the school year, George was relieved when his younger sister was saved \u2014 and delighted when she revealed that Percy had a secret girlfriend, as this was another opportunity to take the mickey out of him.<ref name=\"COS\" />\n\n[[File:Weasley Wizarding Vacation in Egypt.png|235x235px|thumb|The Weasleys in Egypt]]\n\nArthur Weasley had won a large amount of gold from a Ministry contest, something that was both a surprise and delight for the family. The Weasleys used the money won that summer, to take a holiday to [[Egypt]], where the oldest son [[William Weasley|Bill]] was working as a [[Curse-Breaker|Curse Breaker]]. While there, Fred and George tried to push Percy, who had been acting even more arrogant and pompous than usual because he learned he had been appointed [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]], into a pyramid. Their mother stopped them and scolded them severely. They and their brothers went in all the pyramids. They also annoyed [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] when she couldn't go in the last one, most likely because her their mother thought her too young.<ref name=\"POA\" />\n\n====Fifth year====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|George|This, Harry, is the secret of our success.|Fred Weasley|It's a wrench, giving it to you, but we decided last night, your need's greater than ours.|Anyway, we know it off by heart.

Around Christmas, he and Fred decided to give the Marauder's Map to [[Harry Potter]] in order to help him get into [[Hogsmeade]] without permission, as they had already memorised it. They also comforted Harry when he was upset by the presence of [[Dementor]]s at the school that year, and somewhat comforted [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] after his pet rat [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]] went missing. This was also the year that George and Fred took their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] examinations, earning three OWLs each.<ref name=\"POA\" />\n\nIn the summer of 1994, George attended the [[Quidditch World Cup]] with his family as well as Harry and [[Hermione Granger]]. They gambled on the outcome, and won a great deal of money because of it. However, [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] defaulted on the bet. Fred suggested threatening to inform the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] of Bagman's activities, but George was against it, arguing that it was blackmail. That year, George and Fred also started trying out the prank devices they invented, starting with the [[Ton-Tongue Toffee]] on [[Dudley Dursley]].<ref name=\"POA\" />\n\n====Sixth year====\n{{Quote|We thought if we just wrote to him, and told him he'd made a mistake, he'd cough up.

That year, Hogwarts also hosted the [[Triwizard Tournament]], which Fred and George both wanted to enter, despite being underage. They attempted to fool the [[Age Line]] spell that [[Albus Dumbledore]] put around the [[Goblet of Fire]] using an [[Ageing Potion]], but the attempt was unsuccessful, though they both thought their beards were uproariously funny.\n\n[[File:B4C23M1 Weird Sisters playing at the Yule Ball.png|251x251px|thumb|left|The Yule Ball that George attended]]\n\nLater that year, George danced with his chosen partner at the [[Yule Ball]].

He and Fred pocketed [[Doxy|Doxies]] while cleaning up in order to use in their experiments, and spied on Order meetings using their [[Extendable Ears]] invention. They had also passed their [[Apparition]] [[Apparition (class)|tests]] \"with distinction\", and delighted in annoying other inhabitants of the house by frequently Apparating and Disapparating around the house.<ref name=\"OOP\" /> When [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] received news that they were [[Gryffindor]]'s new [[Prefect]]s, George was slightly disgruntled by their mother's overjoyed reaction, and he and Fred both taunted Ron over his accomplishment.<ref name=\"OOP\" />\n\n[[File:DA Luna Fred Ginny George Ron.jpg|240px|thumb|left|Fred and George during a D.A. meeting]]\n\nAlthough neither George nor Fred were very concerned about completing their educations, they returned to Hogwarts for their seventh year, and continued to develop and sell their joke products. Hermione managed to stop them from testing out their products on younger students after threatening to tell their mother that they had been tricking first-years into trying out treats from the [[Skiving Snackbox]]es, a threat George considered \"below the belt\".\n\nGeorge and Fred also joined [[Dumbledore's Army]]. They greatly disliked the new Ministry appointed [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor and High Inquisitor Dolores Umbridge and wanted to oppose [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] control at Hogwarts, as well as prepare to fight [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]].<ref name=\"OOP\" />\n\nLater in the year, Umbridge kicked George, Fred, and Harry off the [[Gryffindor]] [[Quidditch]] [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|team]] and gave them all lifetime bans from [[Quidditch]] after George and Harry got into a fight with [[Draco Malfoy]] (although their bans were lifted immediately when Umbridge was removed from Hogwarts).<ref name=\"OOP\" /> The [[Slytherin]]s had written the lyrics to the demeaning song ''[[Weasley is Our King]]'', intended to humiliate Ron and undermine the Gryffindor team, and then insulted George's parents and Harry's late mother. Things would get worse for George and his family around Christmas, when their father was attacked by [[Nagini]], Voldemort's snake. The Weasleys split their Christmas holidays between Order headquarters and [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]], although [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] did not visit and sent the jumper his mother sent him back unopened, continuing his estrangement.<ref name=\"OOP\" />\n\n[[File:Peeves salutes Weasley twins' departure - PM.png|250px|thumb|Fred and George during their escape from Hogwarts]]\n\nLater in the school year, the D.A. was discovered, but [[Albus Dumbledore]] took the blame and left Hogwarts. George and Fred decided that they no longer cared about getting into trouble, and started an all-out rebellion against Umbridge. They shoved [[Inquisitorial Squad]] member [[Graham Montague]] into a [[Vanishing Cabinet]] when he attempted to dock House Points from them, set off a spectacular array of fireworks of their own making, and created a [[Portable Swamp]] in a corridor.<ref name=\"OOP\" /> In a flourish of vandalism and chaos, George and Fred flew away from Hogwarts, encouraging other students and [[Peeves]] to follow their examples.<ref name=\"OOP\">{{OOTP}}</ref>\n\n===Career as a shop proprietor {{C|1996\u20131997}}===\n====Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes====\n{{Dialogue|Fred Weasley|We've just developed this more serious line.

In the summer of 1996, Harry, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger]] visited the shop and Fred showed Harry around. He also offered Hermione a [[Patented Daydream Charm]] for free after she called them \"extraordinary magic\", but still charged Ron for his purchases. Fred and George also questioned [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] on her love life, much to her irritation.<ref name=\"HBP\" /> That Christmas, the twins stayed at the[[the Burrow| Burrow]] for the holidays.

Fred and George had also created a [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] line of products, such as \"Shield Hats\" and \"Shield Cloaks\" that were widely purchased by the Ministry for its staff.<ref name=\"HBP\" /> Throughout the school year of 1996 to 1997, the twins were able to disguise products to be sent into Hogwarts by mail order (even though all their merchandise was banned by [[Argus Filch]]) to the students.

While in Privet Drive they also tried numerous times to lighten the mood. \n\nOnce in the air a large group of Death Eaters attacked the Order members and their charges, this led to a massive sky battle.

They were as close as two brothers could ever be. The two would always agree with one another, and never get into any fights or arguments, (at least not real ones.) The two did just about everything together. They often finished each other\u2019s sentences and spoke in a back and forth way that could confuse others at times. They were trouble makers, often pranking their siblings, particularly [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], and even sold pranking charms and spells in the boys bathroom. Together, Fred and George designed many ingenious pranks and shared the ambition to found a [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|joke shop]] together. They were also both [[Beater]]s for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] and close friends with [[Lee Jordan]].\n\nGeorge was devastated by the death of his twin in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], and would never truly get over this loss. He eventually named his [[Fred Weasley II|son]] after Fred. \n\n[[File:Weasley Wizarding Vacation in Egypt.png|240x240px|thumb|The Weasley family]]\n\nLike his younger siblings, George tended to look up to his older brothers [[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]]. However, he and Fred delighted in teasing [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], who was closer to their age and rather stuffy.<ref name=\"COS\" /> George was furious with Percy when he fell out with the family over their [[Arthur Weasley|father]]\u2019s support of [[Albus Dumbledore]] and [[Harry Potter]] instead of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]], but the family reconciled just before the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] began when Percy apologised for his mistakes. \n\nGeorge and Fred also enjoyed teasing their only younger brother, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]]. Ron\u2019s phobia of spiders derives from a prank the twins played on him when he was young.In Ron's first year, George teased his younger brother by teaching him a fabricated spell, which in turn led Ron to get embarrassed in front of his friends Harry Potter and Hermione Granger.\n{{Quote|Sunshine, daisies,<br/>butter mellow,<br/>turn this stupid,<br/>fat rat yellow.|Ron Weasley casting the fake spell, taught to him by George Weasley|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}\nThey also teased him over things such as his embarrassing crush on [[Fleur Delacour]]. After Fred's death, Ron helped George run the joke shop for a time. George was quite close to his sister [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], who was similar to the twins in temperament and also liked to tease Ron. They were protective of her, as well, often disapproving of her love life.\nLike most members of the Weasley family, George got on well with his parents. He along with Fred was furious when Draco insulted them and when Harry's mother was insulted too, causing him to let go of George, George proceeded to beat up Malfoy along with Harry and did not regret it even when he was banned from being a Beater at Hogwarts for life.\n\nMrs Weasley was often unhappy with the twins' lack of seriousness and commitment to his learning. She was unhappy with both their earning of only three O.W.L.s and desire to own a joke shop. Mrs Weasley was very upset when she first saw George's cut ear, and thanked [[Remus Lupin]], who saved George from Death Eaters.\n\nMr Weasley was more laid back than his wife. While not overly supportive of George and Fred's wrongdoing, he seemed to encourage the trying of new things. Mr Weasley was excited when informed of George's adventure rescuing Harry Potter from the Dursleys and only pretended to be strict. He was upset by George's injuries after the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], but also very glad that George survived the battle.\n\nAfter the war, [[Arthur Weasley|Mr]] and [[Molly Weasley|Mrs Weasley]] had two grandchildren through George and his wife, [[Angelina Johnson]].\n\n====Harry Potter====\n{{Quote|The Marauder's Map was, however, of immense use to the young Weasley twins...

The twins became friendly with him when he joined the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] as their [[Seeker]], giving them hope to win the [[House Cup]].  The [[1992|following year]], George and Fred cheered Harry up when many of the students believed that he might be the [[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]], which they scoffed at, and the year after that, they gave him the Marauder's Map to help him sneak into [[Hogsmeade]].\n\nThe twins also stood up for Harry when others doubted his claim that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned or challenged his authority in [[Dumbledore's Army]], and assisted him in contacting [[Sirius Black]] when he told them and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] of his desire to speak to his godfather. Both twins risked their lives in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters|operation]] to remove Harry from his [[4 Privet Drive|relatives\u2019 home]] in [[1997]]. They seemed to regard Harry almost as another younger sibling, and were inclined to both be both protective and teasing of him. Harry was very upset by George's injuries after the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]. He eventually became George's brother-in-law through his marriage to [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]].\n\n====Hermione Granger====\n[[File:Hermione Granger HBP promo.jpg|216x216px|thumb|[[Hermione Granger]], his friend and future sister-in-law]]\n\nGeorge became friendly with [[Hermione Granger]] after she became a close friend to his younger brother [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]]. Although Hermione disapproved of some of the twins\u2019 antics, since she was a [[Prefect]], she generally got on fairly well with them. They seem to regard Hermione as somewhat of a sister due to her close relationship with Ron and the fact that she stayed at the Weasley's mutliple times during the holidays. They were outraged when [[Draco Malfoy]] called her a \u201c[[Mudblood]]\u201d in [[1992]], to the point of attempting to physically attack him. Hermione also warned Fred and his twin brother that their [[Ageing Potion]] wouldn't trick the age line protecting the [[Goblet of Fire]] due to the fact that Dumbledore would have thought of a foolish ageing potion in advance. They found out she was right when they were blown backwards and grew long, white beards.\n\nGeorge and Fred also tried to get Hermione to relax, joking around with her about things such as their late uncle [[Bilius]]\u2019s penchant for making mischief at weddings. Hermione also admired the twins\u2019 cleverness and creativity in their spell work, once remarking that they could do some \"extraordinary magic\", though she did not agree with how they put it to use. George also admired Hermione's magical talents and even bet on her beating Ron in a dual during training for Dumbledore's Army. Hermione was also one of the few people willing to stand up to the twins when she disagreed with them. For example, when she caught them testing sweets from the [[Skiving Snackbox]] on first-year students with [[Lee Jordan]], she was furious, and told them off for what she considered taking advantage of innocent children. George and Fred initially scoffed at her concerns and at her ability to make them stop, but backed down when she threatened to tell their [[Molly Weasley|mother]]. However, the twins did not seem to hold a grudge, as they continued to be friendly. Hermione would eventually become George's sister-in-law through her marriage to [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]].\n\n====Angelina Johnson====\n[[File:GOF promo Angelina Johnson.jpg|205x205px|thumb|left|[[Angelina Johnson]], his wife and mother of his children]] \n\nGeorge was friendly with [[Angelina Johnson]], a [[Gryffindor]] in his year and fellow [[Quidditch]] player, during their school years. She attended the [[Yule Ball]] with his twin brother Fred in [[1994]]. After Fred\u2019s death and the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]], she and George evidently grew closer, and eventually married and had two children together. One of the children was named after George's late twin.\n\n====Children====\nAfter the [[Second Wizarding War]], George married Angelina Johnson and together they had two children; [[Fred Weasley II|Fred]], who was named after his [[Fred Weasley|late twin brother]], and [[Roxanne Weasley|Roxanne]]. George possibly had a good relationship with his children, and joked in front of them, as Ron did to his children.\n\n====Nieces and nephews====\nGeorge had also several nieces and nephews through his siblings: [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]], [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]] and [[Louis Weasley|Louis]], Bill and Fleur's children; [[Molly Weasley II|Molly]] and [[Lucy Weasley|Lucy]], Percy and his wife, Audrey's children; [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]], Ron and Hermione's children; [[James Potter II|James]], [[Albus Potter|Albus]] and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily]], Ginny and Harry's children. It is supposed that George had a good relationship with his nieces and nephews, and that they liked him. James also appeared to act like George, because they both enjoyed pulling pranks and teasing their siblings.  \n\n===Minerva McGonagall===\n[[File:Minerva McGonagall POAF promo.jpg|204x204px|thumb|Minerva McGonagall, his previous professor]]\n\n[[Minerva McGonagall]] was the [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] teacher during George and his brother, Fred's years at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Although McGonagall was always well known for being strict and stern, she was never shown punishing or even telling off Fred and George for their wild behaviour and many pranks. It was known however that they were good [[Quidditch]] players from a good family, and she was visibly displeased with having the twins and Harry kicked off the [[Gryffindor]] [[Quidditch]] [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|team]]. McGonagall often perceived the twins as naughty but seemed to share their dislike of [[Dolores Umbridge]], who was the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher for a small time. McGonagall did not attempt to remove the fireworks that surfaced around the school causing great disruptions. When George made his legendary escape in [[1996]], McGonagall assisted [[Peeves]] to unscrew an overhead chandelier, in an obvious homage to Fred and George.\n\n===Lee Jordan===\n[[File:Leejordan OoTP.PNG|218x218px|thumb|left|Lee Jordan, his good friend]] \n\n[[Lee Jordan]] was best friends with Fred and George during his time at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], and often got into trouble along with them. In [[1995]] he joined [[Dumbledore's Army]] and helped the twins harass [[Dolores Umbridge]], one incident of which resulted in him being punished by \"writing lines\", scarring his hand. Lee Jordan also attended Fleur and Bill Weasley's wedding, and danced with [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] in 1997. On [[2 May]], [[1998]], Lee returned with Fred and George to fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. After Fred's death, George and Lee both defeated the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] [[Corban Yaxley|Yaxley]].\n\n===Hogwarts staff===\n[[File:20100111183429!Flitwick HBPoster Lighter.png|223x223px|thumb|[[Filius Flitwick]], his previous professor]]\n\nFred and George had a good relationship with most [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] professors. Professor [[Filius Flitwick]], the [[Charms (class)|Charms]] professor, seemed to like them; he was very happy by their spell work. He also thought that they were very talented wizards, and started to support them, becoming against [[Dolores Umbridge]] in [[1995]].  When Fred and George set off fireworks around the ground she spent a day running around putting them out. After she had done Flitwick's classroom, he told her that he could have put them all out easily but was concerned he didn't have the authority to do so. After Easter break, the twins used one of their inventions, a [[Portable Swamp]] to change a corridor into a swamp and then shortly afterwards they departed from school to go into the world of business. Flitwick was seen cheering and supporting them at their departure after they ran rings around Umbridge and Filch.  Flitwick was asked to remove the swamp they created, which he did but left a small patch in the corner as he believed it to be really good magic.\n\n[[File:Rubeus Hagrid promo.png|229x229px|thumb|left|Rubeus Hagrid, his friend and previous professor]]\n\nFred and George were friends with [[Rubeus Hagrid]], the [[Care of Magical Creatures]] professor, during their time at Hogwarts. Hagrid seemed to be one of their favourite members of the staff, as he was not too serious, unlike many other professors. They were also among the few people who believed that Hagrid was a great person even after they learned that he was a [[half-giant]]. Hagrid also thought that Fred and George were trouble-makers, but very funny. He once compared them with Harry Potter's deceased father [[James Potter I|James]] and his best friend [[Sirius Black]]. Furthermore, they were all among Harry Potter's closest friends. Fred and George fought in the Second Wizarding War along with Hagrid. However, Fred was killed in the Battle of Hogwarts, during an explosion. It is possible that Hagrid was very sad when he learned about that.\n\n[[File:AlbusPOA.jpg|197x197px|thumb|Albus Dumbledore, his previous headmaster]]\n\nBoth Fred and George appeared to like the Headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] and thought that he was the greatest wizard of all time. He seemed to like them, too, despite that they were trouble-makers, and he knew they were good persons. Along with his twin, George joined the [[Order of the Phoenix]], an organisation founded by Dumbledore, in order to oppose [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]] as well as [[Dumbledore's Army]] to oppose Dolores Umbridge and the Ministry of Magic. Fred and George both showed loyalty to Dumbledore by punishing Umbridge after Umbridge became headmistress.\n\n[[File:Severus Snape Profile.jpg|204x204px|thumb|left|Severus Snape, his previous professor and enemy]]\n\nFred and George disliked [[Severus Snape]] the potions master. Snape disliked them, too. This could be because of the fact that the Weasley twins were trouble-makers, like Snape's schoolboy rivals the [[Marauders]], especially [[James Potter I]] and [[Sirius Black]]. Snape was eventually charged with being [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]; however, he was a double agent and working for the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. He accidentally hit George with a [[Sectumsempra]], while aiming at a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]. George possibly learned that Snape was on their side during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].\n[[File:Filch and mrs. Norris.png|205x205px|thumb|Argus Filch, an enemy]]\n\nThe twins also disliked [[Argus Filch]], the caretaker. Filch had punished them many times during their Hogwarts years, because they were trouble-makers. Fred and George also \"nicked\" the [[Marauder's Map]] from Filch, while they were in his office. Filch also had a great knowledge of all Hogwarts' secret passages, only less than Fred and George's. When [[Dolores Umbridge]] was appointed at Hogwarts, Filch supported her, and tried to punish the twins again.\n\n[[File:Dolores Umbridge Deathly Hallows promotional image.jpg|191x191px|thumb|left|Dolores Umbridge, his previous DADA professor and enemy]]\n\nFred and George hated [[Dolores Umbridge]], who was appointed by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] as the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor in [[1995]]. Umbridge was a sadistic woman who enjoyed punishing and torturing students. Almost every resident of Hogwarts at the time hated Umbridge, but she particularly hated [[Harry Potter]] and Fred and George. When George and Harry attacked [[Draco Malfoy]], Umbridge kicked them off the team, along with Fred (although their bans were lifted immediately following Umbridge's removal from the school). Fred and George were the ones who opposed Umbridge. They also created a [[Portable Swamp]], in order to anger Umbridge. When she attempted to punish them, Fred and George insulted her in front of the whole school and then fled with their broomsticks. After the war, Umbridge was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]], for her crimes against [[muggle-born]]s.\n\n===Dumbledore's Army===\n[[File:Dumbledore's Army.jpg|233x233px|thumb|[[Dumbledore's Army]], his alias]]\n\nIn [[1995]], George and Fred joined [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation founded and led by [[Harry Potter]], in order to oppose [[Dolores Umbridge]] and teach [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] to the other students. The twins knew most of them, and they had a good relationship with most members of the army, including Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Ginny Weasley, Lee Jordan and Angelina Johnson.\n\nSome members of the army were also members of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], including [[Alicia Spinnet]] and [[Katie Bell]]. The girls appeared to be close with George, whom they possibly knew since their first year, as well as his brother, Fred. Both of them were very upset when Umbridge kicked Harry and the twins off the team. George met them again when they fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]] and they possibly survived the war.\n\nOther members of the army were [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Luna Lovegood]], [[Dean Thomas]], [[Seamus Finnigan]], [[Lavender Brown]], [[Padma and Parvati Patil|Parvati and Padma Patil]], [[Colin and Dennis Creevey]], [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], [[Hannah Abbott]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], [[Susan Bones]], [[Cho Chang]], [[Anthony Goldstein]], [[Michael Corner]], [[Terry Boot]], [[Marietta Edgecombe]] and [[Zacharias Smith]]. George was friendly with them, although not very close; however, he disliked Zacharias Smith, who didn't believe that Voldemort had returned, and did not fight at the Battle of Hogwarts, as did Marietta Edgecombe, who betrayed the army to Umbridge. However, the rest of them fought for Dumbledore's Army, and at least one of them, Colin Creevey, was killed by Death Eaters.\n\n===The Marauders===\n{{Quote|Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. We owe them so much.|George's appreciation for the Marauders|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}\n\n[[File:Marauders 1997.jpg|220x220px|thumb|James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew]]\n\nGeorge and his brother [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] regarded the [[Marauders]] with a kind of idolatry and they believed that they owed a lot to them, as their invention, the [[Marauder's Map]], helped them to achieve a lot of their aims. Although they owned the map for many years, they did not refer to them as the Marauders, but instead they called them by their nicknames: [[Remus Lupin|Moony]], [[Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]], [[Sirius Black|Padfoot]], and [[James Potter I|Prongs]]. \n\nWhile they were in possession of the map, the twins did not, however, work out that two of the Marauders were two of their friends in the [[Order of the Phoenix]]: [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Sirius Black]]. Neither were they aware that Prongs was in fact [[Harry Potter|Harry]]'s father, [[James Potter I|James]], and that Wormtail was actually [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] [[Peter Pettigrew]].\n\nHe and Fred were both friends of Sirius Black after they both learnt of his innocence. Sirius was friendly with them, but he argued with the twins (for example: when he told them to wait at home while their father was in danger). Sirius was killed by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] in [[1996]]. The twins were saddened by his death, but tried not to remind Harry about it.\n\nThey were also friends of Remus Lupin, whom they first met in [[1993]], when he was [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor. They considered him among the best teachers of this lesson they had ever had. Lupin fought with the twins in many battles of the Second War, and was killed in the final battle, along with Fred. Their bodies were put near each other's in the [[Great Hall]].\n\nIt is unknown if the twins ever learnt the true identities of the Marauders, although it is possible they did eventually learn the truth after Voldemort's return considering that Sirius mentioned Pettigrew's nickname Wormtail in front of them while explaining Voldemort's intentions to them without them questioning that. It is also unknown if Lupin and Sirius ever learnt that the twins both had the Marauders Map in their possession during their time in Hogwarts.\n\n===Order of the Phoenix===\n[[File:Order of the Phoenix \u2013 first generation.jpg|251x251px|thumb|left|The original [[Order of the Phoenix]], his alias]]\n\nGeorge also became a member of the Order of the Phoenix during the [[Second Wizarding War]]. The Order was an organisation led by [[Albus Dumbledore]] in order to fight [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]. George had a good relationship with most members of the order. Some notable relationships include Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, his other family members (excluding Percy who had fallen out with the other Weasleys, and Ginny who was underage) and some of the Hogwarts professors.\n\nAnother member of the Order that they knew was [[Nymphadora Tonks]]. Tonks and the twins were close in age, and they were friendly. They fought together in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].Tonks was killed during the final battle, too. Her body was put near Fred's, as well as Lupin's, after their death.\n\nThe twins also knew [[Alastor Moody]] and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]]. They appeared to have a good relationship, although they were not very close. When Moody was killed by Voldemort, everyone was sad. Before the twins learned about it, they were joking with each other. They immediately stopped talking once they heard Moody died, and their expressions immediately switched to sadness. Kingsley survived the war and became Minister for Magic.\n\n==Media==\n<gallery width=\"200\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nFile:Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Clip) Harry escapes the Dursley's|Rescuing Harry\n</gallery>\n\n==Etymology==\n''[[Wikipedia:George (given name)|George]]'' is a popular male given name derived from the Greek word \u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 (''georgos''), meaning \"farmer\" or \"earthworker\". [[Wikipedia:Saint George|Saint George]] was a third-century martyr who became a patron saint of England after the Crusades. Six kings of Britain have borne the name George. Other famous bearers include the composer George Frideric H\u00e4ndel, first American president George Washington, two kings of Greece, and explorer George Vancouver. It was also the pen name of English writers George Eliot and George Orwell.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/george Behind the Name: George]</ref>  [[J. K. Rowling]] has stated that she chose the name for liking and and finding it fitting with the \"old-fashioned\" theme of the other Weasley brothers.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070724184310/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=72 F.A.Q. question] at {{JKRS}} (archived)</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:George Weasley.png|252x252px|thumb|George Weasley as a [[LEGO Harry Potter|LEGO]] minifigure]][[File:GeorgeWPOP.jpg|thumb|George Weasley as a [[POP! Vinyl]]]]\n[[File:George_Weasley_Yule_Ball_pop_vinyl.jpg|thumb|George Weasley (in his [[Yule Ball]] robes) as a [[POP!

K. Rowling]] described the twins as \"shorter and stockier\" and Percy and Ron as \"long and lanky\", but in the film, Fred and George were a lot taller and lankier than Percy and Ron.\n*George Weasley's O.W.L. results have not been specifically stated by name; he had mentioned in {{OOTP}} that he had an inspected [[Charms (class)|Charms]] lesson, and that he and his brother Fred were going to sell extendable ears before [[Herbology]]. [[Lee Jordan]] also mentioned that they played Exploding Snap in [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]. Since they only passed three subjects, these are most likely the subjects they passed (although it is also possible that the twins chose different subjects to take beyond OWL level and purposely failed other courses to free up their schedules).\n*Rowling has said that George and Fred are among her favourite characters.<ref>[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=8 F.A.Q.: Favourite Characters] at {{JKRS}}</ref>\n*Unlike [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], his younger brother, George never got mad at [[Harry Potter]] for dating and romancing with George's sister, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]]. However, George was protective of Ginny.\n*The Weasley twins were born April Fools' Day - April 1. It's traditional to play a prank on someone on this day, which seems to be a particular hobby of Fred and George's.\n*In {{DH|F1}} it is George who walks in on Harry and Ginny kissing in the kitchen on Harry's birthday, instead of Ron bursting in on them in Ginny's bedroom.\n*It is interesting to note that the only times Fred or George have been injured were when they were apart. They were split up at the time of Fred's death and when George lost his ear.\n*Unsurprisingly, losing his ear barely affected George at all, joking only minutes after having it cut off. By the morning he's even using his ear as a place to hold things.\n\n===Author's comments===\n*J. K. Rowling described Fred and George as \"the risk-takers in the family... who just take a totally different life path and were prepared to risk everything\".<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-3.htm 16 July 2005 Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet Interview]</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Fred and George Weasley}}\n[[File:George WeasleyWU.png|125px|thumb|George Weasley as seen in {{WU}}]]\n[[File:PAS Fred and George Twins.png|125px|thumb|right|[[George Weasley]] as seen in {{PAS}}]]\n*{{PS}} {{1st}}\n*{{PS|F}}\n*{{PS|G}}\n*{{COS}}\n*{{COS|F}}\n*{{COS|G}}\n*{{POA}}\n*{{POA|F}}\n*{{POA|G}}\n*{{GOF}}\n*{{GOF|F}}\n*{{GOF|G}} {{Mention}}\n*{{OOTP}}\n*{{OOTP|F}}\n*{{OOTP|G}}\n*{{HBP}}\n*{{HBP|F}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{Mention}}\n*{{DH}}\n*{{DH|F1}}\n*{{DH|G1}} {{Voice}}\n*{{DH|F2}}\n*{{FB|R}} {{Mention}}\n*{{PM}} \n*{{WW}}\n*{{HPPU}} {{Mention}}\n*{{LEGO|B}}\n*{{LEGO|C}}\n*{{QWC}}\n*''[[J.K.
