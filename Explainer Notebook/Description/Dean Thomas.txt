The message said Harry was back, and we were going to fight! I'll have to get a wand, though....|Dean's determination to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\n'''Dean Thomas''' (b. [[1979]]/[[1980]]) was an [[England|English]] [[half-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], the son of a [[Dean Thomas's father|wizard]] and a [[Dean Thomas's mother|Muggle mother]].<ref name=\"rowling1\" /> When Dean Thomas was very young, his father died and his mother married [[Dean Thomas's stepfather|another man]], giving Dean [[Dean Thomas's half-siblings|several half-siblings]].<ref name=\"rowling1\" /> Since Dean's father never told his mother that he was a wizard and was eventually murdered by [[Death Eaters]] when he refused to join them, Dean grew up thinking he was [[Muggle-born]].<ref name=\"rowling1\" />\n\nDean was a [[Gryffindor]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He was in the same year as the famous [[Harry Potter]] and played as a [[Chaser]] for his house's [[Quidditch]] [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|team]] for a time. In his fifth year, he joined [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation taught and led by [[Harry Potter]]. Dean (although a half-blood) could not prove that he had any wizarding heritage and was therefore in danger when [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] took control of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in [[1997]]. \n\nDean was forced to go on the run to avoid arrest and imprisonment by the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]], missing his seventh year of schooling. He was eventually captured by [[Snatchers]], but [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor|escaped]] [[Malfoy Manor]] along with several other prisoners and soon returned to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] to participate in the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nDean survived the [[Second Wizarding War]] and was seen after the final battle sitting next to [[Seamus Finnigan]] and [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] in the [[Great Hall]]. His later life however, remains unknown.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Dialogue a-b|Dirk Cresswell|Muggle-born, eh?|Dean|Not sure. My dad left my mum when I was a kid.

However, she never had proof of this and so Dean was believed to be [[Muggle-born]].<ref name=\"rowling1\" /> Dean started his education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] on 1 September, [[1991]]. He was in the same year as the famous Harry Potter. During the [[Welcoming Feast]] he was Sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]], where he met with fellow Gryffindor classmate [[Seamus Finnigan]].<ref name=\"PS\"/>\n\n[[File:Dean at feast.jpg|250px|thumb|Dean in the Great Hall with other Gryffindors]]\n\nDean shared a dormitory with Seamus, who soon became his best friend, as well as with [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Harry Potter]], with whom he later became good friends. Due to his Muggle upbringing, Dean, like Harry, was not a supporter of Quidditch, as he had never heard of the sport (though he would eventually become quite a skilled player, filling in for [[Katie Bell]] (mainly) and Ginny Weasley (who switched back to Seeker for the final game with Harry out in his sixth year). However, he hung a West Ham football team poster above his bed, much to the bemusement of Ron, who could not believe Dean would find a game with only one ball, two goals, and where no one was allowed to fly, interesting, prodding the poster in an attempt to get the football players to move.<ref name=\"PS\">{{PS}}</ref>\n\nDean, being artistic, drew a banner entitled \"Potter for President\" for his dorm-mate Harry Potter during the latter's first Quidditch match. The poster pictured a realistically painted Gryffindor lion that, due to [[Hermione Granger]]'s enchantment, changed colours throughout the game. When Harry was fouled by [[Marcus Flint]], Dean demanded that the referee send Flint off (with a Red Card), and Ron Weasley explained that the red card rule did not exist in Quidditch.<ref name=\"PS\"/>\n\n====Second year====\n{{Dialogue a-b-c|Parvati Patil|But, Professor, you'd probably have to use Dark Magic to open it \u2014|Professor Binns|Just because a wizard doesn't use Dark Magic, doesn't mean he can't, Miss Pennyfeather, I repeat, if the likes of Dumbledore \u2014|Dean|But maybe you've got be related to Slytherin, so Dumbledore couldn't \u2014|Dean correctly speculates about the Chamber of Secrets|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\n[[File:Dean & Seamus second year.gif|251x251px|thumb|left|Dean and Seamus in a second year Transfiguration class]]\n\nIn his [[second year]], Dean Thomas joined the [[Duelling Club]], a defensive club taught by [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] in an attempt to train students in battle against any [[Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk|possible danger]] that may be lurking around Hogwarts.<ref name=\"COS11\">{{COS|B|11}}</ref> He, among other students, shared their speculation about the [[Chamber of Secrets]] and what might be inside and how to get in. Dean was about to make a correct speculation, but Professor Binns cut him short before he could finish.

He was allowed to visit the village of [[Hogsmeade]], and he expressed positive interest in the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher [[Rubeus Hagrid]] as he always got on with him. However, in their first lesson when Hagrid introduced the class to a [[hippogriff]] named [[Buckbeak]], Dean stepped back and showed fear when Hagrid asked for a volunteer to pet him. Also in this year Dean would take on the subject Divination and was, along with Lavender Brown, one of the few students in their class unfamiliar with the Grim. That year, Hogwarts became under the protection of [[Dementor]]s following the hysteria surrounding the [[Azkaban escapes|Azkaban escape]] by [[Sirius Black]].<ref name=\"POA\" />\n\n====Fourth year====\n{{Dialogue a-b|Dean Thomas|I still can\u2019t work out how you two got the best-looking girls in the year.|Ron Weasley|Animal magnetism.|Dean and Ron discussing [[Padma and Parvati Patil]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\nDuring Dean's fourth year, Hogwarts hosted the [[Triwizard Tournament]], and his friend, Harry Potter had qualified as an under-aged champion. This was against tournament rules, so Harry was not the popular choice for Hogwarts representative, and instead, most support was given to [[Cedric Diggory]] by Dean's peers. However, Dean and other fellow Gryffindors supported Harry throughout the course of the tournament, staying loyal to their housemate.<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n\n[[File:Gryffindor dance lesson.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Dean and fellow Gryffindor boys during dance lessons with McGonagall]]\n\nDean would also be allowed to attend the [[Yule Ball]] as part of the tournament traditions. He commented that Harry and Ron were lucky to get the prettiest girls in the year as their dates, twin sisters [[Padma and Parvati Patil|Parvati and Padma Patil]]. It is unknown, though, about who Dean attended the dance with, as his best friend [[Seamus Finnigan]] was going with [[Lavender Brown]] and [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] was going with [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]].<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n\nLater on in the tournament, after Ron Weasley had forgiven Harry, Dean also seemed to be more supportive. After the third and final task, Harry returned to Hogwarts with [[Cedric Diggory]]'s dead body, and he said that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] was at large again. Albus Dumbledore took this information and at the end of the year he gathered students for a [[Memorial feast to Cedric Diggory]] in which he told them about the events that took place during the third task.<ref name=\"GOF\">{{GOF}}</ref>\n\n====Fifth year====\n{{Dialogue a-b|Dean|It's like Harry said, isn't it?

She called [[Remus Lupin]] a \"''dangerous half-breed'',\" which caused Dean to jump in to his defence, claiming that he was the best teacher he ever had, and commenting in response to Umbridge's comments that her [[Alastor Moody|predecessor]] had actually performed curses on them that the man in question had \"''turned out to be a [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|maniac]]''\", although he noted that they had still learned a great deal. He also was very supportive of Harry's claims that Voldemort had returned. Additionally, he and Seamus argued when Dean believed Harry about Voldemort returning and Seamus initially did not.<ref name=\"OTP\"/>\n\n[[File:Dean_in_d.a..jpg|251x251px|thumb|left|Dean standing with [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]], [[Cho Chang|Cho]], and  [[Parvati Patil]] during a D.A. meeting]]\n\nUmbridge soon caused an uproar amongst most students due to her ineffective teaching and cruelty, and when it came time to rebel, Dean was one of the first to arrive for the inaugural meeting of the group that became [[Dumbledore's Army]] in [[1995]], at the [[Hog's Head Inn]]. Dean was an enthusiastic member of the D.A. and learned how to cast numerous defensive spells under Harry's skilful teaching, in the [[Room of Requirement]] where the group secretly held their classes.<ref name=\"OTP\"/>\n\nAlso that year, Dean accidentally insulted his new [[Divination (class)|Divination]] teacher, [[Firenze]], after Umbridge had sacked [[Sybill Trelawney]]. Firenze was telling Dean that he had been banished by his herd living in the [[Forbidden Forest]], and Dean was excited to discover there were more centaurs around the school grounds and asked him if Hagrid was breeding them. Firenze told Dean that centaurs were their own race, had little to do with humans and did not require their help to breed, which caused Dean to become extremely embarrassed.<ref name=\"OTP\"/>\n\nDuring his fifth year, Dean took his [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] exams, and after he finished, he was pleased to hear that the results would not arrive until sometime in [[July]], meaning he did not have to worry about them until the middle of the school holidays. Later in the year, Umbridge and her [[Inquisitorial Squad]] would discover the D.A. and the meeting would end for the year. Some time around the end of his fifth year, Dean became romantically involved with [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]]<ref name=\"OTP\">{{OOTP}}</ref> and the two continued dating well into his sixth year.<ref name=\"HBP\"/>\n\n====Sixth year====\n{{Dialogue a-b|Ron Weasley|Just choose someone \u2014 better \u2014 next time.|Ginny Weasley|Well, I've chosen Dean Thomas, would you say he's better?|Ginny announces her relationship to her brother|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n[[File:Halfblood-00660.jpg|251x251px|thumb|New couple Dean and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] together on the Hogwarts Express with [[Luna Lovegood]]]]\n\nIn his [[1996\u20131997 school year|sixth year]] Dean replaced [[Katie Bell]] as the [[Chaser]] for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. He replaced her after she was hospitalised for touching a highly [[Opal Necklace|cursed necklace]]. At first Dean's relationship with Ginny seemed to be strong, as the couple spent a lot of time together. They dated in spite of her older [[Ronald Weasley|brother]] Ron's disapproval. Despite the amount of time they spent together their relationship began to spiral downwards. This was in part due to Ginny's insistent crush on [[Harry Potter]]. She had harboured affection for Harry since her [[first year]] at Hogwarts. At the end of her first year, her affections only intensified when Harry saved her from the influence of [[Tom Riddle's diary]]. Ginny still maintained hope that Harry would return her feelings, she started dating Dean and a few other boys.<ref name=\"HBP\"/>\n\n{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Harry Potter|Are you still interested in playing Chaser?|Dean Thomas|Wha \u2014?

Blimey, I can't wait to tell Ginny!|Dean's enthusiasm to play Quidditch|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\nGinny also showed Dean her willingness to continue standing up for  Harry, such as when she told Dean off for laughing about Harry getting hit by a [[Bludger]]. This accident that knocked him out with a cracked skull during one [[Quidditch]] game (making her visit him in the hospital wing afterward). It is possible that when Ginny learned from Dean during their visit to [[Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop]] five months prior about Harry inadvertently casting the ''[[Levicorpus]] ''charm on Ron when reading it from [[Severus Snape's copy of Advanced Potion-Making|the Half-Blood Prince's copy of ''Advanced Potion-Making'']]'' ''the night before, she may have berated him as for laughing with Seamus about that as well. As a result, Dean became overly solicitous with her, trying not to provoke another argument, to keep their relationship going, which increasingly annoyed Ginny.<ref name=\"HBP\"/>\n\n[[File:Halfblood-dean.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Dean as Ginny Weasley's date to Slughorn's Christmas party]]\n\nAccording to [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], when Harry bumped into Ginny while climbing through the Gryffindor common room entrance under his [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]] and under the influence of [[Felix Felicis]], Ginny believed that it was Dean who kept trying to help her through the portrait hole and the two argued over it. Dean stuck to his ground, saying he did not help her through and Ginny ended their relationship. Dean was shocked at the insensitivity of his friend Harry, when this happened (not knowing an invisible Harry was the true culprit and cause). Harry and Ginny shared a kiss at a Quidditch party soon after she broke up with him, and Dean broke his glass in astonishment that his room-mate and ex-girlfriend would start a romance so soon. Despite this, Dean shared no hate to either Ginny or Harry for their relationship; he was just hurt they would do such a thing so shortly after he was dumped by her.<ref name=\"HBP\"/>\n\n[[File:B6C30M1 funeral of Albus Dumbledore.png|250x250px|thumb|The funeral of Albus Dumbledore that Dean attended]]\n\nThe same year was also the year that the headmaster of Hogwarts school, [[Albus Dumbledore]] was killed. Dean Thomas attended his funeral with his best friend Seamus Finnigan after Seamus had rowed rather publicly with his mother to allow him to stay for the ceremony.

The Ministry also imprisoned them in [[Azkaban]] for [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission|allegedly stealing magic]].

The group stuck together and camped in different areas in an attempt to mislead any trails they may have left. At one point whilst on the run, Dean travelled alone with Griphook, most likely after the others were killed. Dean and Griphook often shared conversations about [[Harry Potter]], Dean fully supporting Harry in his quest and Griphook somewhat doubtful and occasionally finding the mentioning of Harry's name tedious. One evening they were overheard by Harry, Hermione, and Ron who were also in hiding; Dean expressed his worry at hearing that his former girlfriend, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], had gotten into trouble back at Hogwarts, as well as the belief that Harry was fighting Voldemort.<ref name=\"DH\"/>\n\n====Captured by Snatchers====\n{{Quote|It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell.

Dean helped Harry and Ron dig a grave for Dobby by hand to show gratitude, rather than do it with magic. Dean placed a woolly hat on top of Dobby, to represent that Dobby was a free elf. At the funeral, Dean expressed his thanks to the elf for [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor|rescuing them]].<ref name=\"DH\"/>\n\nDean spent the next few months of hiding at Shell Cottage with Luna, Griphook and the trio.

[[Dean Thomas's father|His biological father]] was a wizard who walked out on his Muggle wife and infant son in order to protect them from the Death Eaters. He never told his wife that he was a wizard, and was soon after killed by the Death Eaters when he refused to join their cause.

The two were often seen together at school, and Dean attended the [[Quidditch World Cup]] with Seamus and [[Seamus Finnigan's mother|his mother]] in [[1994]]. Seamus initially believed the smear campaign the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' ran against [[Harry Potter]] when he claimed that Voldemort had returned, but this did not appear to have affected his friendship with Dean, who believed Harry and who eventually managed to get Seamus to attend the final D.A. meeting of the year.<ref name=\"OTP\" />\n\nSeamus was also displeased when Dean was chosen as the replacement [[Chaser]] for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] over him when [[Katie Bell]] was injured, but again, the two still remained best friends.<ref name=\"HBP\" /> Since Dean could not return to Hogwarts for his final year, the two did not see each other for some time, and they missed each other greatly.

They appeared to be very close at first, but, according to Ginny's friend [[Hermione Granger]], things began to get rocky as Ginny became displeased with Dean for what she perceived as over-protectiveness, as Dean constantly tried to assist her in everything. Ginny's enthusiasm about the relationship seemed to ebb by [[Christmas]] of 1996, as she did not seem terribly eager to see Dean upon her return to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. The couple also began to row over little things, like Dean's constant attempts to help Ginny through the portrait hole into the Gryffindor common room, and they fought after Dean and Seamus laughed when Harry suffered a fractured skull courtesy of [[Cormac McLaggen]].<ref name=\"HBP\"/>\n[[File:Tumblr lip6qdRRT31qf3ys8o1 500.jpg|240x240px|thumb|left|Dean and Ginny on a date at the [[Three Broomsticks Inn|Three Broomsticks]]]]\nHarry contributed to their ultimate break-up by bumping up against Ginny when she and Dean were going through the portrait hole while under his [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]] and after having taken [[Felix Felicis]]. Thus, luck was on the side of Harry, who had developed an interest in Ginny, and she thought Dean was trying to push her through the portrait. This row led to their split. <ref name=\"HBP\"/>\n\nGinny clearly got over Dean soon after they broke up, as she began dating Harry soon after and admitted to him that she had never really given up on Harry. Dean, however, seemed astonished and hurt when he saw Harry and Ginny kissing, and went as far as smashing his glass, indicating that he took their split harder.<ref name=\"HBP\" /> Later, while Dean was on the run and heard news about Ginny, Harry noted that Dean was concerned for her welfare.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\n===Dumbledore's Army===\n{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|Well, that was pretty good, but we've overrun, we'd better leave it here.

Harry resented Dean slightly during their sixth year out of jealousy over Dean's romance with [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], on whom he had developed a crush. When Dean and Ginny split up, Harry's enmity lifted, though Dean then became upset when Harry kissed his ex-girlfriend soon after their break-up.<ref name=\"HBP\" /> In spite of this, Dean never seemed to carry any ill will towards them, as he was aware of Ginny's crush on Harry since her first year at Hogwarts. In fact, during his rescue from Malfoy Manor, he was reluctant to escape with [[Dobby]] and leave Harry behind.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\nDean was also good friends with both [[Fred and George Weasley]], older [[Gryffindor]] students.

A more likely explanation is that, having been raised in a Muggle household, Dean was a fan of the ''Star Wars'' series of films, much the same as he brought a poster with football players to Hogwarts because he was a fan of Westham FC.\n*Alfie Enoch and Devon Murray have both expressed that they like the fan theory of Dean and Seamus ending up together.<ref>[http://www.be.com/bim/alfred-enoch]</ref>\n\n===Character reduction===\n[[File:Deanthomasoriginal.PNG|240px|thumb|left|Dean Thomas was originally a prominent character, and was better friends with the main trio. This is an early sketch drawn by JKR of how she originally wrote the scene \"Midnight Duel\" which originally included Dean Thomas, however in publishing he was cut]]\nDean Thomas was originally going to be a more prominent character in the novels, like [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] and [[Luna Lovegood]], but his role was initially cut down. Originally, Dean was called \"Gary\", and in {{PS}}, Dean Thomas was going to be first introduced during the \"Sorting Hat\" chapter. His character was cut from the UK copies due to needing to shorten the chapter, however he still is in some US copies. He also was going to be featured in the chapter \"Midnight Duel\" going along with Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville to confront [[Draco Malfoy]], but he was cut out of this scene entirely. After having cut Dean out so much from the books, Jo did not want him to go unnoticed in the films and when {{PS|FA}} was in production she blew away director [[Chris Columbus]] with the amount of information she had on such a minor character. In {{COS}} J.K. Rowling had originally included Dean Thomas' background story, which explained about his \"Muggle-born\" blood status and his father being a wizard, but it was cut out again as it was \"unnecessary content.\" Jo has said that she believes she swapped developing Dean Thomas to develop the character [[Neville Longbottom]] instead, as he was more relevant to the overall plot. Dean later plays a somewhat larger role in {{HBP}}, where he becomes Ginny's boyfriend and a member of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and {{DH}}, where he is on the run, kidnapped, and rescued.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Dean Thomas}}\n*{{PS}} {{1st}}\n*{{PS|F}}\n*{{COS}}\n*{{COS|F}}\n*{{COS|G}} {{Voice}} {{Comment|PS1 version only}}\n*{{POA}}\n*{{POA|F}}\n*{{POA|G}}\n*{{GOF}}\n*{{GOF|F}}\n*{{OOTP}}\n*{{OOTP|F}}\n*{{OOTP|G}}\n*{{HBP}}\n*{{HBP|F}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{Mention}}\n*{{DH}}\n*{{DH|F1}} {{Mention}}\n*{{DH|G1}}\n*{{DH|F2}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}}\n*{{LEGO}}\n*{{PM}} \n*{{TCG}}\n*{{HPV|CH}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=[[Katie Bell]]\n|position=[[Chaser]] of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]\n|years=[[1997]]\n|successor=[[Katie Bell]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n{{Dumbledore's Army}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thomas, Dean}}\n\n[[de:Dean Thomas]]\n[[es:Dean Thomas]]\n[[fr:Dean Thomas]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0438\u043d \u0422\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0441]]\n[[fi:Dean Thomas]]\n[[it:Dean Thomas]]\n[[pl:Dean Thomas]]\n[[no:Tommy Ding]]\n[[sv:Dean Thomas]]\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:Battle of Hogwarts participants]]\n[[Category:Chasers]]\n[[Category:Dumbledore's Army]]\n[[Category:English individuals]]\n[[Category:Ginny Weasley's romantic relationships]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors Sorted in 1991]]\n[[Category:Half-bloods]]\n[[Category:Half-orphans]]\n[[Category:Imperius Curse victims]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Skirmish at Malfoy Manor participants]]\n[[Category:Thomas family]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
