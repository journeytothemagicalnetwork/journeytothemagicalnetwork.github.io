There was a [[portrait]] of her hung at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name=\"MHP\">{{MHP}} {{See image|File:Mary I.jpg}}</ref>\n\nShe was a daughter of the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] king [[Henry VIII]] and his first wife Catherine of Aragon and thus a half-sister to her successor, [[Elizabeth I]].<ref name=\"wikipedia\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Mary\" is the usual English form of Maria, which was the [[Latin]] form of the New Testament Greek names \u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03bc (Mariam) and \u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 (Maria) - the spellings are interchangeable - which were from the Hebrew name \u05de\u05b4\u05e8\u05d9\u05b8\u05dd (Miryam). The meaning is not known for certain, but there are several theories including \"sea of bitterness\", \"rebelliousness\", and \"wished for child\". However it was most likely originally an [[Egypt]]ian name, perhaps derived in part from mry \"beloved\" or mr \"[[love]]\".\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]] {{Portrait}}\n*{{WWHP}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{MHP}} {{Portrait}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=([[Henry VIII|\u2190]]) Edward VI\n|position=Queen Regnant of England\n|years=[[1553]]-[[1558]]\n|successor=[[Elizabeth I]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n[[es:Mar\u00eda I]]\n[[pl:Maria I]]\n[[Category:1516 births]]\n[[Category:1558 deaths]]\n[[Category:Brown-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:English individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Historical figures]]\n[[Category:Portraits]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Tudor dynasty]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
