A notable bearer was the Scottish outlaw and folk hero Rob Roy (1671-1734). It is often associated with French roi \"king\".\n\nRoy is also the pet form of Roibeard (the Gaelic form of [[Robert (disambiguation)|Robert]]), the short form of Royal (meaning \"king\" or \"kingly\") or the Anglicised version of the name Ruadh (meaning \"red\") [http://www.20000-names.com/male_r_names_3.htm] [http://webspace.webring.com/people/ge/edgarbook/names/frames.html]. It is also possible that Roy is a shortened form of another name in the Potter universe such as Royden (see [[Royden Poke]]) or Royston (see [[Royston Idlewind]]).\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{COS|G}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Duelling Club}}\n[[es:Roy]]\n[[fr:R\u00e9mi]]\n[[pl:Roy]]\n\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Duelling Club members]]\n[[Category:Green-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 20th century]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
