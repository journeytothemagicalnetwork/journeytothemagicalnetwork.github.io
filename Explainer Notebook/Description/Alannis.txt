She was at least in her [[first year]] by [[1996]] and was the captain of the Ravenclaw [[Duelling Club]] but due to her being trusted to be captain, it is likely she was at least in her [[second year]].<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nAlannis was sorted into [[Ravenclaw]] when she arrived at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. In [[1996]] Alannis became captain for [[Ravenclaw]] when the [[Duelling Club]] was revived by [[Albus Dumbledore]] as a precaution to help students defend themselves if the event of an attack from [[Death Eaters]] or [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] was ever to happen. [[Minerva McGonagall]] convinced [[Harry Potter]] to join the Ravenclaw Duelling Club, introducing him to Alannis, who requested that he showed a group of watching Ravenclaws how to cast ''[[Levicorpus]]''. After her duel with Harry she jokingly told him to watch his back as other Ravenclaws might hit him with their newly learnt [[jinx]].<ref name=\"HBPG\">{{HBP|G}}</ref>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': As head of the [[Ravenclaw]] [[Duelling Club]], Alannis was a highly skilled duellist, who was proficient with the casting of various offensive and defensive spells, such as the [[Stunning Spell]], [[Shield Charm]], [[Disarming Charm]] and ''[[Levicorpus]]'', showing she was talented with [[Martial magic]].<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Angus Matlock]]\n*[[Hufflepuff Duelling Club Captain]]\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Alannis has only ever appeared in the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{HBP}} never in any of the [[Harry Potter (book series)|novels]].\n*Her last name may be [[Alannis Shepley|Shepley]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{HBP|G}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Duelling Club}}\n[[de:Alannis (Spiel 6)]]\n[[es:Alannis]]\n[[pl:Alannis]]\n[[ru:\u0410\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0441]]\n[[fr:Alannis Shepley]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Brown-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Duelling Club Captains]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
