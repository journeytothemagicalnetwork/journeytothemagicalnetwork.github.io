In keeping with this assessment, in [[1996]] she agreed to tell [[Harry Potter]] what she knew about [[Draco Malfoy]]'s activities in the [[Seventh-floor corridor]] in exchange for a [[Skiving Snackbox]], which she planned to use to skip [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] (a subject she described as ''\"stupid\"''). She warned Harry not to tell anyone about what she told him.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{PS2 only}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nettlebed, Tracey}}\n[[pl:Tracey Nettlebed]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
