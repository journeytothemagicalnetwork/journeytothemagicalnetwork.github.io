Her mother accidentally [[Death|died]] while experimenting with [[spell]]s when Luna was nine and Luna was raised by her father, editor of the magazine ''[[The Quibbler]]'', in a [[Lovegood House|rook-like house]] near the village of [[Ottery St Catchpole]] in [[Devon]]. \n\nLuna attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1992]]-[[1999]] and was sorted into [[Ravenclaw|Ravenclaw House]]. In her fourth year, Luna joined [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation taught and led by [[Harry Potter]], of which she became an important member. She participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] ([[1996]]) and the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] ([[1997]]), and co-led the reconstituted [[Dumbledore's Army]] when [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] fell under the control of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] with Severus Snape as headmaster. \n\nBecause of her father's political dissidence at the time, Luna was abducted by [[Death Eaters]] to be held ransom, and imprisoned in the dungeons of [[Malfoy Manor]] for months. She was [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor|freed]] by [[Dobby]] along with several other prisoners in the spring of [[1998]], and stayed at [[Shell Cottage]] until she returned to Hogwarts to participate in the [[Battle of Hogwarts|final battle]] of the [[Second Wizarding War]].\n\nAfter the war, Luna became a [[Magizoologist]] (Studies magical creatures) discovering and classifying many magical species that had never been encountered before. She eventually married [[Rolf Scamander]], the grandson of [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], a famed Magizoologist, with whom she had twin sons, [[Lorcan and Lysander]]. Luna's good friends [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Potter]] also named their daughter and third child, [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Luna Potter]], in honour of her.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life {{C|1981\u20131992}}===\nLuna was born on [[13 February]], [[1981]], the only child of [[Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius]] and [[Pandora Lovegood]]. Luna's mother was accidentally killed while experimenting with a spell that she created when Luna was nine years old. Thus, Luna was subsequently raised by her father. As she witnessed her mother's death, she was able to see [[Thestral]]s, the magical skeletal black horses that led the Hogwarts carriages, from that point onward.<ref name=\"OTP\"/>\n\n===Hogwarts years {{C|1992\u20131998}}===\n====Early years====\n{{Quote|Some people call me 'Loony' Lovegood, actually.|Hogwarts' students view of Luna|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}Luna attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1992]] and was sorted into [[Ravenclaw|Ravenclaw House]]. One year behind the famous Harry Potter, she noticed [[Thestral]]s on her very first day of school, [[1 September]] [[1992]].\n\nDuring her years at Hogwarts, she was often teased by many of the other students due to her strange behaviour and odd beliefs. Some time during her early years at Hogwarts students had also taken to calling her \"Loony Lovegood\". Luna also met and became a friend of [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], who was in the same year as her. In the summer of [[1994]], she went to the [[Quidditch World Cup]] with her father.<ref name=\"GOF8\">{{GOF|B|8}}</ref>\n\nIn her [[third year]] at Hogwarts, she chose [[Divination (class)|Divination]] as an elective, as in the [[1996\u20131997 school year]] [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] claimed to miss her in class; Luna explained she had [[Firenze]] that year.<ref name=\"HBP15\">{{HBP|B|15}}</ref> She may also have attended [[Study of Ancient Runes]], as before the [[1995\u20131996 school year]], she was seen reading an article written about runes in ''[[The Quibbler]].''<ref name=\"OOTP10\">{{OOTP|B|10}}</ref>\n\n====Fourth year====\n{{Quote|There's room in this one, there's only Loony Lovegood in here \u2014 Don't be silly, she's all right.|[[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] introduces Luna to Nevile Longbottom|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix }}<!-- Don\u00b4t change this to fifth, she's younger than Harry. -->\n\n[[File:Order-of-the-phoenix-movie-screencaps.com-3530.jpg|250x250px|thumb|left|Luna meeting the [[trio]] and [[Neville Longbottom]] for the first time]]\n\nIn Luna's fourth year, she met and befriended [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Neville Longbottom]]. She believed Harry's declaration that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] was back. As the year progressed, she was invited to join an underground [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] group called [[Dumbledore's Army]], which was taught and led by Harry Potter. This organisation was to teach practical defence. She eagerly accepted, working hard along with the others and enjoying their company. In an effort to make people believe Harry's story, Hermione arranged an interview for him with [[Rita Skeeter]] at the [[Three Broomsticks Inn|Three Broomsticks]] \u2014 Luna accompanied them so as to persuade her father to publish the interview in ''[[The Quibbler]]''. The copy sold out, every Hogwarts student and possibly every professor as well, read the copy because of the Education Decree that stated that it was banned on school grounds.<ref name=\"OTP\"/>\n\n[[File:Dean in d.a..jpg|250x250px|thumb|Luna standing next to [[Dean Thomas]] and [[Cho Chang]] during a [[Dumbledore's Army]] meeting]]\n\nNear the end of the year, Harry had a vision that his godfather, [[Sirius Black]] was being tortured by Lord Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries. Luna and Ginny stood guard while Harry and Hermione snuck into [[Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]]'s office, to use the fireplace to try to contact Sirius, while Ron attempted to distract Umbridge. However, they were caught, along with Neville Longbottom, by Umbridge and members of the [[Inquisitorial Squad]]. They were restrained and gagged, but Luna hardly seemed bothered by this as she was staring, dreamily, through the window as if bored.<ref name=\"OTP\"/> \n\nHarry and Hermione drew Umbridge away into the [[Forbidden Forest]], and Luna, Ginny, Ron, and Neville managed to escape from the Inquisitorial Squad using a variety of hexes and jinxes. When they all met up again in the forest, Harry planned to go to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Luna reminded Harry about the [[Thestral]]s and suggested using them to get to the Ministry. She then mounted her Thestral side-saddle, \"as though she did this every day.\" She also helped Ron, Hermione and Ginny mount their Thestrals, as the animals were invisible to them. The six D.A. members flew to the Ministry and entered the [[Department of Mysteries]], where Luna heard voices coming from behind a [[Veil]], just as Harry did. The group was soon ambushed by twelve [[Death Eaters]].<ref name=\"OTP\"/>\n\n[[File:Tonks and Moody helping Luna escape GIF.gif|245x245px|thumb|left|Moody and Tonks helping Luna during the stand-off in the [[Death Chamber]]]]\n\nLuna participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries|battle]] that ensued. She protected Ron, who had been hit with a [[Confundus Charm|spell]] that made him highly confused. Luna also attacked a Death Eater who had seized Ginny's ankle with the [[Reductor Curse]], which destroyed a model of the planet Pluto. The model blew up in the Death Eater's face; however, the impact broke Ginny's ankle. Luna guided both the injured Ginny and the [[Confundus Charm|Confunded]] Ron until they met up with Harry and Neville. Luna was one of the last D.A. members to fall, eventually being [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] by a Death Eater and thrown across the room. She regained focus just before the end of the battle and survived relatively unscathed. At the end of the school year, Luna spoke to Harry, who was mourning the murder of his godfather and had found no comfort in talking to [[ghost]]s. Luna told him about [[Pandora Lovegood|her mother]]'s death and her belief that she would see her again someday, which was a comforting thought to Harry.<ref name=\"OTP\"/>\n\nThat summer, Luna and [[Xenophilius Lovegood|her father]] went to [[Sweden]] using the money the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' paid them to reprint ''The Quibbler'''s interview with Harry to see if they could catch a [[Crumple-Horned Snorkack]].<ref name=\"OTP\">{{OOTP}}</ref>\n\n====Fifth year====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a-b-a-b|Harry Potter|So have you had a good term?|Luna|Oh, it's been alright.

On her way to Hogwarts in the [[Hogwarts Express]], Luna shared a compartment with [[Harry Potter]] and she was accompanied by [[Neville Longbottom]]. Luna was holding another edition of the Quibbler, which she told Harry was going strong because of his interview. She then put on a brightly coloured pair of free \"Spectrespecs\" that were from inside the Quibbler. She was very disappointed to find out that the [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] would not continue that year. When [[Romilda Vane]] asked Harry if he wanted to join her and her friends in another compartment, while treating Luna and Neville with disdain, Harry coldly rebuffed her, stating that they were his friends. Luna correctly observed that people expected Harry to associate with \"cooler\" people; he replied that she and Neville were cool, and among his closest and most trustworthy friends.<ref name=\"HBP\"/>\n\n[[File:Luna Lovegood at the Slug Club party.jpg|150px|thumb|Luna Lovegood at the [[Slug club]] party]]\nTowards Christmas, Luna comforted [[Hermione Granger]] after [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] mocked her in [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] and Hermione ran into the girl's bathroom in tears. Luna had found Hermione crying and Harry had been looking for Hermione to return the books she left in Transfiguration class. After Hermione left, Harry asked Luna if she would like to go to Professor Slughorn's Christmas party with him, just as friends, and Luna excitedly accepted his invitation.<ref name=\"HBP\"/> \n\n[[File:Slug Club party.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Luna as Harry's date at Slughorn's Christmas party]]\n\nLuna wore a set of spangled silver robes that was attracting a certain amount of giggling from the onlookers, but she otherwise looked quite nice. While there, she conversed with multiple people, and took an interest in [[Sanguini]], a [[vampire]] guest. She also made Harry laugh so hard that mead came out of his nose when she discussed the [[Rotfang Conspiracy]] after [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] sneered at Harry's ambition to become an [[Auror]]. She continued the discussion of the Rotfang Conspiracy with [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]], who seemed completely interested. Luna was also present when Draco Malfoy was caught out of bed after hours by Filch and dragged into the party to be punished.<ref name=\"HBP\"/>\n\nAlso that year, Luna would temporarily replace [[Zacharias Smith]] as [[Quidditch]] commentator for the school. Many found Luna's commentary amusing, as Luna forgot players' names and went off on tangents such as speculating that Smith, who was unable to maintain procession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute, was suffering from \"[[Loser's Lurgy]]\", or saying how a cloud was interestingly shaped. She never actually attempted reported the score, and [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] had to report it. However, after Ron heard this commentary, which he found highly amusing, he said \"''you know, Luna's grown on me,''\" when previously he found her very strange and slightly off-putting.<ref name=\"HBP\"/>\n\n[[File:Ron, Luna, & Pomfrey raise wands.jpg|251x251px|thumb|Luna raising her wand after the death of Albus Dumbledore, along with Ron Weasley and [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]]]]\n\nLuna once gave Harry a note from [[Albus Dumbledore]] telling him to come to his office for a private lesson. At the end of the school year, the castle came under attack by [[Death Eaters]], and Luna was one of the few D.A. members to participate in the ensuing [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], along with Neville, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], Ron, and Hermione. Harry asked her and Hermione to watch Snape's office, which they did, but Snape told them that Death Eaters were in the castle and that they had to look after [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]], whom he claimed had collapsed. After taking [[Felix Felicis]] from Harry, the D.A. members were almost untouchable, and all survived the battle unscathed except Neville, who was injured but soon recovered. Luna helped him into his seat when they attended Albus Dumbledore's funeral at the end of the school year.<ref name=\"HBP\">{{HBP}}</ref>\n\n====Sixth year====\n<!-- Don\u00b4t change this to seventh, she's younger than Harry. -->{{Dialogue a-b-a|Harry Potter|The [[Lovegood family|Lovegoods]] are quite unusual.

Luna was able to instantly recognise [[Harry Potter]], who was disguised as a [[Weasley family|Weasley]] cousin by use of [[Polyjuice Potion]], by only his expression. She wore yellow robes, at her father's insistence, and had a sunflower in her hair. Her father believed that wearing sun colours to weddings brought luck. Luna sat at the same table as Harry, [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]]. At one point, while under the influence of gnome saliva, Luna started dancing by herself, twirling on the dance floor with her arms raised. This drew attention from a few onlookers, as it was a very bizarre sight.<ref name=\"DH\"/>\n\n[[File:DH1 Death Eaters inside Hogwarts Express 02.jpg|251x251px|thumb|Death Eaters conduct a raid on the [[Hogwarts Express]] in an attempt to capture Harry Potter]]\n\nThat day, the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] was taken over by [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]], so it was to a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]-controlled [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] that Luna returned for her sixth year. On 1 September, Death Eaters boarded the train in search of Harry Potter, but were unsuccessful in capturing him because he wasn't on board. [[Severus Snape]] had also been appointed headmaster and Death Eaters [[Alecto Carrow|Alecto]] and [[Amycus Carrow]] professors. Early in the year, Luna, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] attempted to steal the [[Sword of Gryffindor]] from the Headmaster's office, in an effort to help Harry. Snape caught them and sent them into the [[Forbidden Forest]] with [[Rubeus Hagrid]] as punishment. The three of them revived and led [[Dumbledore's Army]], which tried to sabotage the Death Eaters' control of the school and to help Harry, Ron and Hermione \u2014 who were off hunting down Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es \u2014 in any way they could.<ref name=\"DH\"/>\n\nOn her way home over the Christmas holidays, Death Eaters captured Luna because her father had been printing stories in support of Harry.<ref name=\"DH\">{{DH}}</ref>\n\n====Capture and escape====\n{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione Granger |Where's Luna?

Her father was so desperate to get her back that he tried to turn Harry, Hermione, and Ron over to the Ministry in exchange for her freedom; the trio escaped, but Hermione ensured that the Death Eaters [[Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius]] called glimpsed Harry as they left, so that neither he nor Luna would be punished. The [[Lovegood House|Lovegoods' home]] was largely destroyed with an erumpent horn, which Xenophilius had believed to be a [[Crumple-Horned Snorkack]]'s, blew up inside. After the failed ambush Xeno was taken to Azkaban prison for the remainder of the war.<ref name=\"DH\"/>\n\n[[File:Harry-potter-deathly-hollows-p2-harry luna dobby.jpg|250px|thumb|Luna comforting Harry while he holds a deceased Dobby]]\n\nThe prisoners in Malfoy Manor were soon joined by Harry, Ron, [[Dean Thomas]], and [[Griphook]] the goblin, while Hermione was [[Cruciatus Curse|tortured]] for information upstairs by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. After Luna helped cut the ropes off their new cell-mates, [[Dobby]] the [[house-elf]] came to free them. He took Luna, Dean and Ollivander to [[Shell Cottage]], the home of [[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur Weasley]], and then returned to assist Harry, Hermione, Ron and Griphook in escaping the Manor. He died in rescuing them.<ref name=\"DH\"/> \n\nUp until the Battle of Hogwarts, Luna stayed at the cottage for the remainder of the war, and when Dobby was buried, she closed the house-elf's eyes and provided the eulogy, thanking him for rescuing her. During her stay, she practised using a new wand that Ollivander had made for her. She also seemed to have started a friendship with Dean. It is unknown what Luna did after Harry, Ron and Hermione left Shell Cottage in order to [[Break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank (1998)|break into]] [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]], but she returned to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in May when Neville signalled her as to the trio's return.

She took Harry to the Ravenclaw common room, answering the riddle, \"''What came first, the Phoenix or the flame?''\", with \"''A circle has no beginning.''\", in order to gain entrance, in order to show him a replica of the diadem. There, she stunned [[Alecto Carrow]], who was waiting for them per [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s orders. When given the choice, she joined the battle rather than evacuating with the younger students. She stood side-by-side with fellow D.A. members, students, as well as her professors and helped hold back Voldemort's army of Death Eaters and Dark creatures.<ref name=\"DH\"/>\n\nIt is unknown exactly what Luna did after accompanying Harry to Ravenclaw Tower. However, at one point she, [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], and [[Seamus Finnigan]] helped the trio drive off a group of [[Dementor]]s that attacked them by casting their [[Patronus Charm|Patronuses]]. Luna encouraged Harry to think of something happy, enabling him to summon his Patronus as well. It was Harry's Patronus that caused the Dementors to finally scatter. Luna and the others slipped back into the battle. She was present when Voldemort reported Harry supposed \"death\" and when Neville bravely stood up to Voldemort.

She often wore odd pieces of jewellery such as a [[Butterbeer]] cork necklace and [[Dirigible plum earrings]], and in 1996, a pair of [[Spectrespecs]].<ref name=\"HBP\"/> Luna also did not wear shoes because students in her house would take her shoes and hide them.<ref name=\"OTP\"/>\n\nAt Hogwarts [[Quidditch]] matches, Luna supported [[Gryffindor]] against every House except [[Ravenclaw]]; to show her support for Gryffindor, she would wear a hat in the shape of a lion head that roars, and to show support for Ravenclaw she would wear an eagle hat with flapping wings.<ref name=\"OTP\" /> At [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]'s [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]] in 1996, she wore spangled silver robes.<ref name=\"HBP\" /> At [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]]'s wedding, she wore bright yellow robes because she was taught it brought luck to a wedding to wear sun colours and had a sunflower in her hair, as well.<ref name=\"DH\" /> She was described as \"pretty\" on some occasions, despite her odd clothes.\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Luna was once again demonstrating her usual knack of speaking of uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite like her.|Luna's unusual character traits|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\n\n[[File:Harry-potter-and-the-half--blood-prince-Luna.jpg|241x241px|thumb|Luna's unusual appearance]]\n\nLuna was an extremely quirky girl, with a serene disposition and many eccentric beliefs and qualities. She was a complete nonconformist; she lacked self-consciousness and was not afraid to show who she truly was. Luna was also intelligent and unusually perceptive, having been sorted into [[Ravenclaw]]<ref name=\"OTP\" /> ''\"where those of wit and learning will always find their kind.''\" A prime example of Luna\u2019s perceptiveness was when she pointed out the ironically drastic measures taken against [[Sirius Black]] when he escaped Azkaban, but when ten Death Eaters (including [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]) escaped, barely any measures were taken to recapture them.\n[[File:Luna in class.JPG|142px|thumb|Luna introducing Harry to the Thestrals]]\nAlthough many thought Luna was bizarre, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley, Dean Thomas and Ollivander eventually became very fond of her.<ref name=\"HBP\" />\n\nLuna's demeanour and voice were often distant and dreamy; she would drift away from a conversation she did not find interesting. However, whenever someone made fun of her father or his magazine ''[[The Quibbler]]'', the dreamy quality in her voice would vanish and be replaced by one of steel, and she would immediately become very angry. She had an uncanny way of making others uncomfortable by being bluntly honest \u2014 [[Harry Potter]] described her as having a \"''knack for embarrassing honesty''\". She was also completely unflappable and rarely seemed anxious or stressed, even under difficult circumstances such as being a prisoner of [[Malfoy Manor]]. Luna was very good at comforting others. She comforted Harry after [[Sirius Black|his godfather]]'s death<ref name=\"OTP\" /> and [[Garrick Ollivander|Mr Ollivander]] while they were imprisoned together.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n[[File:Luna and Harry.gif|235x235px|thumb|left|Luna comforting Harry after the death of his godfather]]\n\nLuna was often the subject of ridicule and had difficulty making friends. Other students gave her the nickname of \"Loony Lovegood\" and even stole and hid her things. She was unfazed by this, and instead chose to be nonjudgmental and accepting of those around her.<ref name=\"OTP\" /> She once said that she did not like dancing much, though she did dance some at the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding of Bill and Fleur]], along with her father. \n\nLuna seemed to have enjoyed artistic pursuits in her free time; her house was filled with various things that she painted.<ref name=\"DH\" /> She even painted very life-like portraits of her friends that seemed to breathe. Luna was very loyal to the few friends she had \u2014 she published Rita Skeeter's interview of Harry Potter on ''The Quibbler'' (March issue, 1996)<ref>{{OOTP|B|26}}. Rita Skeeter interviewed Harry at the end of Chapter 25 (''The Beetle at Bay'').</ref> during the latter's fifth year and supported Harry even when he was outlawed by the Ministry of Magic.

Some theories she believed in included: [[Sirius Black]] being [[Stubby Boardman]], that [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] was a [[vampire]], that the [[Auror]]s were part of the [[Rotfang Conspiracy]] to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using [[Dark Arts|Dark magic]] and gum disease, that the [[Tutshill Tornados]] were top of the league by a combination of bewitched brooms and torture, that [[Cornelius Fudge]] ordered [[goblin]]s to be made into pies, drowned, or assassinated in other various ways, had an army of [[Heliopath]]s, and used the [[Department of Mysteries]] to develop terrible poisons to feed to anyone who disagreed with him.\n\nLuna also believed in things that were proven true: Harry's story about [[Return of Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's return]], the voices beyond the [[veil]] and the belief that there were people behind it, and that [[Hufflepuff]] [[Chaser]] [[Zacharias Smith]] was suffering from [[Loser's Lurgy]]. Loser's Lurgy is not proven to exist, but it was true that when Smith lost in Quidditch he thus acted accordingly.\n\nSome of the animals she believed in were: [[Moon Frog]]s, [[Blibbering Humdinger]]s, [[Crumple-Horned Snorkack]]s, [[Heliopath]]s, [[Umgubular Slashkilter]]s, [[Nargle]]s, [[Aquavirius Maggot]]s, [[Wrackspurt]]s, [[Gulping Plimpy|Gulping Plimpies]], and [[Dabberblimp]]s.\n\nShe also believed in the fable of [[Ravenclaw's Diadem|Lost Diadem]], a crucial Ravenclaw item and a [[horcrux]], which turned out to be a turning point in Harry's battle against Voldemort.<ref name=\"DH\"/>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n[[File:Patronus2.gif|236x236px|thumb|right|Luna conjuring a corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] in the form of a hare at age fourteen]]\nLuna was shown to be a very talented and powerful witch.

At the age of fifteen, she participated in and survived the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] with no more than a few minor injuries. She also emerged from the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] with no major injuries. During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] she, [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] duelled against the notorious [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] and emerged as one of the survivors.\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': In her fourth year, Luna learned how to conjure a corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] in the form of a [[hare]],<ref name=\"DH\" /><ref>[http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/translation-evanna-lynch-interview-46573/ \"Harry Latino Interview\"] retrieved from [http://www.snitchseeker.com/ Snitch Seeker]</ref> which is an incredibly advanced, powerful and protective charm, as well as a mark of superior [[magic]]al ability and talent, showing her proficiency for charm-work. She could also cast simple charms such as the [[Locking Spell]], [[Reductor Curse]], [[Stunning Spell]], [[Levitation Charm]], [[Revelio Charm]] and [[Wand-Lighting Charm]] successfully without difficulty. \n*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': In 1998, Luna wordlessly stunned the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] [[Alecto Carrow]] with the [[Stunning Spell]], while inside Ravenclaw Tower.<ref name=\"DH\"/> The fact that she could effectively cast it nonverbally is a testament of sorts to her skill, since non-verbal magic is highly difficult, [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level magic.\n[[File:Thestrals WB F5 ThestralsHarryAndLunaInTheForest Illust 100615 Land.jpg|220x220px|thumb|Luna and Harry, looking at the [[Thestral]]s.

This wand she used through out her life as a Hogwarts student, until she was captured and her wand confiscated and broken by Death Eaters in the middle of her sixth year. Her second wand was of unknown length, wood, and core material as well.

When Harry took [[Polyjuice Potion]] to look like Barny at the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour]], she recognised him from the expression on his face, hinting again at the closeness of their friendship, as she was not fooled for a minute by his disguise. Shortly before going to sacrifice himself during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Harry noted that Luna was among his closest friends, whom he had hoped to see one last time before his death. After Voldemort's defeat at Harry's hands, Luna sensed that Harry wanted to get away from the victory celebrations, and created a distraction so that he could slip away with Ron and Hermione.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\nLater in life, Harry and Luna would remain close friends. He and Ginny even gave their [[Lily L. Potter|daughter]] the middle name \"Luna\" in honour of her.

It's so unfair that you had to die, when you were so good and so brave. I'll always remember what you did for us. I hope you're happy now.|Luna's eulogy at Dobby's funeral|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\n[[File:Dobby.jpg|208x208px|thumb|[[Dobby]], her friend]]\nLuna liked Dobby the [[house-elf]], who came to rescue her from [[Malfoy Manor]]. After Dobby was killed by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], Luna closed his eyes, to make him \"''seem like he was sleeping''.\" She also said a few words to Dobby during his [[Funeral of Dobby|funeral]]. \n\nLuna had also met [[Garrick Ollivander]], the wandmaker, at the [[Malfoy Manor]], where they were both imprisoned. She comforted Ollivander, and gave him courage. After they both escaped, Ollivander, who had grown quite fond of Luna, made her a new wand. She also met [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]] when she stayed for a few weeks at their house, [[Shell Cottage]]. She left Shell Cottage when she, Dean, Bill and Fleur went to fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. Luna thought [[Rubeus Hagrid]] was a poor teacher, saying that the students in Ravenclaw thought him to be a bit of a joke, and that she preferred Professor Grubbly-Plank. It is possible this opinion started to change during Umbridge's control of Hogwarts, as they were both against Umbridge and Luna credited Hagrid's teaching of [[Thestral]]s, which allowed them to go to the Ministry of Magic when they believed [[Sirius Black]] was in danger. During the [[1997\u20131998 school year]], Luna and Hagrid both acted in opposition to the Death Eaters' regime at Hogwarts, and Luna, along with Ginny and Neville, once served detention with Hagrid in the Forbidden Forest when they were caught by Snape.\n\n==Etymology==\n*Luna means \"Moon\" in Latin (as well as in Italian, Russian, Spanish, Bulgarian and Romanian). People believed that the moon caused craziness, which may be why she's the way she is. Her nickname, \"Loony\", also references the moon and its ties with insanity, as it is short for \"lunatic\".\n*''Lovegood'' is a real surname and a compound word (Love and Good). Speaking in accordance of her having good feelings for every person she knew, hence Lovegood.\n*Luna Lovegood is also alliterative, for effect.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:LunaLovegood WB F6 LunaLovegoodCharacterIllustration V2 Illust 080615 Port.jpg|150px|thumb|Luna as she appears on {{PM}}]]\n[[File:WB F5 LunaLovegood ConceptArtCostumeSketch ArtWork-181.jpg|150px|thumb|Luna as she appears on {{PM}}]]\n[[File:Luna's Lion Hat - Concept Art.jpg|150px|thumb|Concept art of Luna and her Lionhead hat]]\n[[File:LunaLovegoodWU.png|150px|thumb|Luna Lovegood as she appears in {{WU}}]]\n[[File:Quidditch Fan Luna Lovegood WU.png|150px|thumb|Quidditch Fan Luna Lovegood as she appears in {{WU}}]]\n[[File:LunabyPottermore.jpeg|150px|thumb|right|Luna as she appears on {{PM}}]]\n*Luna is the only one of Harry's close school friends who is not a fellow Gryffindor.\n*Harry names his daughter, Lily Luna, after her. Luna is the only person still living to give their name to one of Harry's children.\n*The [[Dirigible plum earrings]] Luna wears in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' were made by [[Evanna Lynch]] herself, as was a bracelet she wore (in the shape of Luna's patronus) in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''.\n*In {{OOTP|FA}}, it is [[Hermione Granger]] who introduces Luna to her friends, instead of [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], though the books imply that Hermione had never met Luna before.\n*Luna was the last person in the books known to commentate a [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] [[Quidditch]] match. It is unknown if she commented during the final match during [[Harry Potter]]'s sixth year.\n*In {{HBP}}, [[Nymphadora Tonks]] rescues Harry from the [[Hogwarts Express]] after [[Draco Malfoy]] uses the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] on him. However, in the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|film version]], Luna is the one who rescues Harry, by using her [[spectrespecs]] to see the [[Wrackspurt]] buzzing around his head, alerting her to his presence under the [[Cloak of Invisibility|cloak]].\n*In {{HBP}}, Hermione points out that Harry put something in Ron's drink before the Quidditch match, but in the film version, it is Luna who notices, thinking it is a tonic.\n*According to {{HBP|FA}} Luna sleepwalks at night and says because of that she wears shoes to bed.\n*It was rumoured that Severus Snape was Luna's father and that Luna and Neville Longbottom were going to end up together at the end of ''Deathly Hallows''. Both these rumours were false. However, in the film adaptation of {{DH|F2}}, [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] confesses to [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] that he is crazy for Luna. They are later seen sitting beside each other in the infirmary. However, [[Matthew Lewis]] has said that this is merely a \"summer fling\" before Neville marries [[Hannah Abbott]] and Luna marries [[Rolf Scamander]].<ref>http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/audio-harry-potter-cast-and-crew-at-deathly-hallows-part-2-nyc-press-conference-82597/</ref>.\n*Luna and fellow [[Dumbledore's Army]] member, [[Neville Longbottom]], both have compound last names. Love and good for Luna, and long and bottom for Neville.\n*In {{DH|F2}}, Luna seems to have an intimate friendship with [[Helena Ravenclaw]], who knew the location of the diadem of Ravenclaw.\n*[[Evanna Lynch]], who plays Luna Lovegood in the film series, named her cats after Harry Potter characters: she has a cat named Luna and another named [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]. She also had a cat named [[Crookshanks]], although it is now deceased.\n*In a deleted scene from {{DH|F2}}, Luna leaves [[Shell Cottage]] to return to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Harry tells her that it is not the same, to which Luna replies: \"Neither am I.\"<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfsZaXNMLjE</ref> This is a reference to Luna's more mature and realistic worldview following the war.\n*[[Scarlett Byrne]] auditioned to play Luna,<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DwCGd-xpd0</ref> as did the famous Irish actress [[wikipedia: Saoirse Ronan|Saoirse Ronan]],<ref>.http://www.irishcentral.com/ent/Saoirse-Ronan-admits-disappointment-over-Harry-Potter-Luna-Lovegood-role-126725153.html</ref> and ''[[wikipedia: The Dark Knight Rises|The Dark Knight Rises]]'' star [[wikipedia: Juno Temple|Juno Temple]].<ref>http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/10/juno_temple.html</ref>\n*Evanna recently portrayed Luna again for one of [[Jessie Cave]]'s Pindippy videos.\n*In the film adaptation of {{DH|F2}}, Luna did not show the [[Ravenclaw Tower#Ravenclaw Common Room|Ravenclaw Common Room]] but instead shouted at [[Harry Potter]] because of his reluctance of listening to her attempts of her approach about finding [[Ravenclaw's Diadem|Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem]].\n*A variant of Luna is available in the \"Downloadable Character Pack\" [[Wikipedia:Downloadable content|DLC]] for {{LEGO|Y2}}. The variant is called \"Luna (Lion Head)\" because it portrays Luna wearing her [[Luna Lovegood's lion-topped hat|lion hat]].\n*In Part 2 of the final film, Luna is not seen duelling [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] alongside [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] but can be seen duelling two Death Eaters alongside an unidentified student behind Bellatrix during her duel with [[Molly Weasley]].\n*IGN listed Luna Lovegood as their 12th top ''Harry Potter'' character, saying that loony-ness made her a \"delight\".<ref>[http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/07/12/top-25-harry-potter-characters?page=3 IGN,Top 25 Harry Potter Characters]</ref>\n*Empire Magazine listed Luna as their 10th favourite Harry Potter character in \"The 25 Greatest Harry Potter Characters\".<ref>[http://www.empireonline.com/features/greatest-harry-potter-characters/16.asp Empire, The 25 Greatest Harry Potter Characters]</ref>\n*In the early drafts, Luna's name was \"Lily Moon,\" until [[J. K. Rowling|Rowling]] changed it.\n*Luna is the only known member of the Lovegood family whose first name is not of Greek origin, rather it is of Latin origin. \n*[[J. K. Rowling|Rowling]] originally intended Luna and Neville to end up together. In an interview with USA Today, she stated that she \"started to feel a bit of a pull between them\" but added that if they were together by the end it would have \"felt too neat\". Additionally, she stated that \"Neville would always find Luna\u2019s wilder flights of fancy alarming, despite their close friendship.\"<ref>\nhttps://www.pottermore.com/features/things-you-may-not-have-noticed-about-luna-lovegood</ref>\n*Evanna Lynch has stated that she considers Luna to be a [[Wikipedia:Vegetarianism|vegetarian]], as it is her belief that Luna would not [[Wikipedia:Vegetarianism#Treatment of animals|feel morally right eating animals who have suffered]].<ref>[http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/evanna-lynch-talks-wizarding-world-of-harry-potter-gringotts-ride-projects-veganism-100060/ Video: Evanna Lynch talks Wizarding World of Harry Potter Gringotts ride, projects, veganism] at SnitchSeeker.com</ref> However, Luna has eaten meat dishes in the books, such as [[Gulping Plimpy]] soup.\n===Author's comments===\n[[J. K. Rowling]] has said that the character of Luna took her by surprise, but that she was very fun to write, and contrasted her with [[Hermione Granger]]: \"''She's slightly out of step in many ways but she's the anti-Hermione. Hermione's so logical and inflexible in so many ways and Luna is likely to believe ten impossible things before breakfast.''\"<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2003/0626-alberthall-fry.htm 26 June 2003 J.K.

Rowling 2012 Interview \u2013 Harry Potter: Beyond the Page]</ref>\n\n===Luna in the films===\n[[File:Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood) HP5 screenshot.JPG|150px|thumb|Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood]]\n[[Evanna Lynch]] plays Luna in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]], and since Evanna is [[Ireland|Irish]], Luna has a slight touch of an Irish accent. In the films, Harry meets her at the school carriages where she is introduced by Hermione instead of Ginny. Luna's [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] is revealed to be a Hare, this is later confirmed to be canon in {{DH}}. Luna is seen barefoot throughout the film because students had stolen her shoes. In addition, Luna seems to have a taste for pudding and introduces Harry to the [[Thestral]]s; she offers a young Thestral an apple, which was turned down, before offering it a bit of raw meat with an accepting smile.\n\nShe also skipped around the school. Her [[butterbeer]] cork necklace has only one cork, which she says is to repel [[Nargle]]s. She also wears a beetle ring. During the battle at the Ministry, instead of being knocked unconscious, she was hit in the mouth by a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] before using an unusual verbally-incanted version of ''[[Levicorpus]]'' to hurl her attacker away. When Ginny disintegrates the prophecy shelves with a [[Reductor Curse]], Luna is so distracted by the light that she does not run away, but Neville saves her. She is then taken hostage along with all of Harry's companions but is rescued by the appearance of the Order of the Phoenix members (Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Kingsley, and Mad Eye).\n\nIn {{HBP|FA}}, she states that she often sleep-walks at night and wears her shoes to bed just in case.\nLynch was a huge fan of the series before she was cast.\n\n===Luna in the games===\n[[File:LEGO Luna.jpg|150px|thumb|Luna as a LEGO minifigure]]\nLuna's role in the game is much the same as her role in the film, though we do not meet her until Harry goes to find the people who signed up for the D.A. to tell them about the [[Room of Requirement]]. The Player has to help Luna feed the Thestrals, and then she will appear in the Room of Requirement. Later in the game, [[Fred and George Weasley]] send Luna to tell Harry how to swamp the clock tower courtyard, with one of their [[Portable Swamp]]s. At the end of the game, the player must help Luna find her missing objects, which are: a jumper, a newspaper, a lion mask, a pair of pink shoes, and her purse. Luna is also a playable character in the HBP game. She is a two-player [[duelling]] character and is unlocked (with Draco Malfoy) by retrieving two crests.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Luna Lovegood}}\n[[File:LunaLovegoodPOP.jpg|150px|thumb|Luna Lovegood as a [[POP!
