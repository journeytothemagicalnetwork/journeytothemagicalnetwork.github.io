G. McGonagall''' was a [[Gryffindor]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the early [[1970s]]. They played on the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], winning an award for it in [[1971]], which was displayed at Hogwarts on a plaque that also bore the names of [[James Potter I|James Potter]] and [[R. J. H. King]].\n\nMcGonagall may have been related to [[Transfiguration]] teacher [[Minerva McGonagall]]. It is possible that M. G. McGonagall is one of her nephews or nieces from her two brothers, [[Robert McGonagall Junior|Robert Jnr]] and [[Malcolm McGonagall|Malcolm]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*The name M. G. McGonagall appears only in {{PS|FA}}. M. G. McGonagall cannot have been the same person as [[Minerva McGonagall]], as Minerva was already a teacher at Hogwarts by [[1910]]. It also can't be any of her siblings, who Minerva helped her mother in covering up magical accidents from their father already during her pre-Hogwarts years. It presumably is one of the nieces or nephews of Minerva's, and as such, the child of either Malcolm or Robert.\n*In the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{OOTP}}, a trophy can be found in the [[Trophy Room]] near the [[Great Hall]]. Inspecting it causes [[Ronald Weasley]] to comment on the presence of Minerva McGonagall's name near [[James Potter I|James Potter's]], to which [[Harry Potter]] speculates that it may have been due to her being [[Head of Gryffindor House]] at the time. However, these two awards cannot be considered the same, as the one seen in  {{PS|FA}} is a plaque, and not a cup.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{PS|F}} {{Comment|Name appears on trophy}}\n*{{PM}} {{Possible}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n\n[[de:M.
