After Dumbledore's death in [[June]], [[1997]], Mr Doge wrote him an obituary for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''. Later that same summer, he attended the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] of [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]] and [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] at [[The Burrow]], and managed to [[Apparition|Disapparate]] from there seconds before the [[Attack at the Burrow]] that ensued when [[Death Eaters]] arrived after the [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|fall of the Ministry]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life {{c|1881-1899}}===\n{{Quote|I had contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school, and while I was no longer contagious, my pock-marked visage and greenish hue did not encourage many to approach me.|''[[Daily Prophet]]'', Summer [[1997]]; ''Albus Dumbledore Remembered'' by Elphias Doge|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\nElphias Doge was born around [[1881]], to the [[pure-blood]] [[Doge family]].<ref name=\"HPLE\"/> Sometime in or prior to [[1892]], Doge contracted [[Dragon Pox]].<ref name=\"DH2\"/>\n\nOn [[1 September]], [[1892]], at age eleven, Elphias Doge started at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. No longer contagious of his [[Dragon Pox]], but still with a \"''pock-marked visage and greenish hue''\", not many approached Doge. [[Albus Dumbledore]], however, looked past that and befriended him during their first day at Hogwarts. Doge believed that their mutual attraction was due to the fact that they both felt that they were outsiders: he had his greenish skin tone and Dumbledore was primarily known to others as the son of [[Percival Dumbledore]], who scarcely a year previously had been convicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon three young [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s.<ref name=\"DH2\" /> Their peers at Hogwarts would often think of Doge as Dumbledore's \"''dim-witted but devoted sidekick''\".<ref name=\"DH18\" />\n\nWhen Doge and Dumbledore left Hogwarts in [[1899]], they planned to take a [[Grand Tour]] of the world together. However, when they were staying at the [[Leaky Cauldron]] and preparing to leave for [[Greece]], they got news that Dumbledore's mother [[Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]] had died.<ref name=\"DH18\"/> Doge attended Kendra's funeral and departed for the Grand Tour without Dumbledore. He wrote letters to Dumbledore about his \"''narrow escapes from [[Chimaera]]s in Greece to the experiments of the [[Egypt]]ian [[Alchemy|alchemists]]''\".<ref name=\"DH2\"/> He came back home shortly after the death of Dumbledore's sister [[Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]], whose funeral he also attended.<ref name=\"DH8\">{{DH|B|8}}</ref>\n\n===First Wizarding War {{c|1970s-1981}}===\n{{Quote|Original Order of the Phoenix.

During that time, he would usually wear a silly hat.<ref name=\"OP9\">{{OOTP|B|9}}</ref> Given his role within the Order, it is more than likely that Doge fought in several battles of the [[First Wizarding War]].\n\n===Between wars===\nBetween the wars, Elphias Doge served the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] as [[Special Advisor to the Wizengamot]].

He wore a moth-eaten fez and sat alone in a table drinking champagne. Recognising him from two years before that, and having read Dumbledore's obituary, [[Harry Potter]], disguised as a Muggle to look like a Weasley cousin, joined him and the two had a brief conversation about Dumbledore's childhood, before being interrupted by [[Muriel]], who believed every word of [[Rita Skeeter]]'s sensationalist and mostly false biography of Dumbledore. Doge passionately defended Dumbledore and his family, but Muriel repeatedly contradicted him.<ref name=\"DH8\" />\n\nWhile this was happening, the [[Death Eaters]] were staging a [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|coup in London]], killing [[Minister for Magic|Minister]] [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] and taking over the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. In an attempt to siege [[Harry Potter]], the [[Death Eaters]] infiltrated the wedding, in a [[Attack at the Burrow|short but aggressive skirmish]].<ref name=\"DH8\" /> Doge managed to [[Apparition|Disapparate]] from the Burrow just seconds before the [[Death Eaters]] arrived.<ref name=\"DHpt1\">{{DH|F1}}</ref>\n\nIt is unknown what happened to Elphias after the attack at the wedding and it is also unknown if he participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].\n\n==Physical appearance==\n[[File:Elphias Doge OOTP 2.jpg|99px|thumb|Doge in 1995]]\nDoge was described as having a wheezy voice<ref name=\"OP3\" /> and white hair which made him resemble an aged dandelion clock.<ref name=\"DH8\" /> In his first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], he suffered from [[Dragon Pox]]; he had many green pimples on his skin.<ref name=\"DH2\" /> Doge also appears to enjoy wearing eccentric hats: a \"stupid hat\" he used to wear in the [[1970s]],<ref name=\"OP9\" /> a pointy hat he wore in [[1995]],<ref name=\"OPf\">{{OOTP|F}}</ref> and a \"moth-eaten fez\" he wore during the [[wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour]].<ref name=\"DH8\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nIn his youth, Doge suffered from [[Dragon Pox]], and everybody at Hogwarts avoided him, except [[Albus Dumbledore]]. This made Elphias friendly towards Dumbledore. Doge has appeared as being a very loyal friend.<ref name=\"DH2\" /> He also disliked unfairness, as he got angry when [[Muriel]] falsely claimed that [[Ariana Dumbledore]] was a [[Squib]] and that her family had imprisoned her.<ref name=\"DH8\" /> Doge also appeared as being a friend of the most members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], such as [[James Potter II|James]] and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]].<ref name=\"OP3\" /> [[Rita Skeeter]] heavily implies Doge to be senile or \"dim-witted\",<ref name=\"DH2\" /> but this was most likely spiteful slander of his character because of his refusal to help her in her [[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore|biography]] of [[Albus Dumbledore]];<ref name=\"DH8\" /> the post he held within the Ministry, that of Special Advisor to the [[Wizengamot]] suggested otherwise, implying that he was a highly intelligent, knowledgeable and wise wizard indeed.<ref name=\"DH2\" />\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Apparition]]''': At the Wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour, he successfully managed to escape via Disapparation when the Death Eaters attacked.<ref name=\"DH8\"/>\n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Elphias was part of the Order's [[Advance Guard]] in [[1995]], escorting Harry Potter to 12 Grimmauld Place by flying on a [[broomstick]], showing him to have been an accomplished flyer.<ref name=\"OP3\"/>\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Elphias was capable of producing a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm]],<ref name=\"LEGOY2\"/> which is a mark of superior [[magic]]al ability and talent, given the immense difficulty of performing the charm. \n\n==Relationships==\n===Albus Dumbledore===\n[[File:600full-Albus-Dumbledore-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-photo.jpg|196x196px|thumb|left|[[Albus Dumbledore]], his good friend]]\nElphias was close friends with [[Albus Dumbledore]], meeting him the first time at Hogwarts. They were both outcasts, as he contracted [[Dragon Pox]] shortly before he began schooling.\n\nDumbledore, on the other hand, was an outcast because of [[Percival Dumbledore|his Muggle-hating father]].<ref name=\"DH2\" /> After graduating from school, they had planned to tour the world. However, when they were packing to go to [[Greece]] at the [[Leaky Cauldron]], Dumbledore got an [[owl]] informing him that his [[Kendra Dumbledore|mother]] had died and that he had to go home instead.<ref name=\"DH18\" />\n\nWhile Elphias was travelling to Greece, Dumbledore had to take care of his siblings. At the time Elphias was ending his travel, Ariana was killed.<ref name=\"DH2\" /> Elphias learned that she was accidentally killed in a duel between Albus, [[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]] and [[Gellert Grindelwald]]. No one ever learned who killed her.\n\nIn their later life, Dumbledore and Elphias remained close friends. Elphias had a high opinion of Albus; he thought that he could see the good inside all the people, however apparently insignificant or wretched. After Dumbledore's death, Elphias wrote a heartfelt obituary for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''. At Bill and Fleur's wedding, Elphias stated to Harry Potter that he \"''certainly knew Albus the longest''\", if you didn't count his own brother, Aberforth.<ref name=\"DH2\" />\n\n===Dumbledore family===\n[[File:Aberforth Dumbledore.jpg|thumb|Aberforth Dumbledore|192x192px]]Elphias was also close to the [[Dumbledore family]]. Elphias was unable to meet [[Percival Dumbledore|Percival]], Albus's father, as he was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for punishing three Muggles who had scared [[Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]].<ref name=\"DH2\" /> After that, Ariana lost her sanity and could not control her magical abilities. Doge also liked [[Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]], Albus's mother. He later stated that she was a fine woman.<ref name=\"DH8\" />\n\nKendra was accidentally killed by Ariana. A few months later, Ariana was also accidentally killed in a duel between Albus, [[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]] and [[Gellert Grindelwald]], when she attempted to help Albus and Aberforth. It never became clear who did kill Ariana. Elphias participated at her funeral, where Albus and Aberforth had an argument.<ref name=\"DH18\" />\n\nElphias thought that Albus was much more popular than Aberforth, and that people never do seem to count Aberforth. Aberforth also thought that Elphias admired Albus very much, and that Elphias \"''thought the sun shone out of Albus's every orifice''\", although Aberforth does not seem to have such a high opinion of Doge, referring to him as an \"old berk\".<ref name=\"DH28\">{{DH|B|28}}</ref>\n\n===Harry Potter===\n[[File:Harry Potter movies hbp promostills 6.jpg|201x201px|thumb|left|[[Harry Potter]]]]\nElphias seemed to very much like and respect Harry Potter.<ref name=\"DH8\" /> When he first met Harry, he said that he looked like his father, but he had his mother's eyes;<ref name=\"OP3\" /> something that everyone told Harry. Elphias was also a member of the [[Advance Guard]], a group of members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] who escorted Harry to [[12 Grimmauld Place]].<ref name=\"OP3\" /> \n\nElphias met Harry again in [[1997]], at the wedding of [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]]. They discussed Albus Dumbledore, and Elphias told him that Albus was a very good person, something that helped Harry feel better.<ref name=\"DH8\" />\n\n===Muriel===\n[[Muriel]] was the loud, ill-mannered, opinionated, 107 year-old aunt of Molly Weasley. She enjoyed gossip very much and [[Rita Skeeter]], and thus was incredibly pleased that Skeeter was to be writing a new book, known as ''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]'', that would slander Dumbledore. Muriel was delighted in revealing the dark parts of Dumbledore's history to Doge, who idolised and admired him and refused to hear anything bad about him. Being close to the Dumbledores, Doge was very emotional about the tragedy of [[Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]], so to hear Muriel so rudely cackling about it made him furious and feebly wheeze about how untrue it was. Muriel brought Doge to the verge of tears as Muriel made him feel wretched and miserable as he heard slanderous lies being told about Albus. While it is true that some of the information in Skeeter's book was true and Doge did skip over the parts that didn't make Dumbledore look very good, Doge still disliked Muriel for horrifying him with the terrible things Skeeter was going to write and the way Muriel took pleasure in hearing them.<ref name=\"DH8\"/>\n\n===Order of the Phoenix members===\n[[File:Order of the Phoenix.png|250x250px|thumb|The [[Order of the Phoenix]], his allies]]\nElphias was a member of both the first<ref name=\"OP9\" /> and the second Order of the Phoenix.<ref name=\"OP3\" /> He had a good relationship with the most members, including [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], [[Alastor Moody]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Remus Lupin]], [[Sturgis Podmore]], [[Emmeline Vance]], [[Dedalus Diggle]] and [[Hestia Jones]], who were also members of the [[Advance Guard]].<ref name=\"OP3\" /> Moody did not seem to like Elphias' \"stupid hat\" during the [[First Wizarding War]].<ref name=\"OP9\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n*''Doge'' was the title held by the elected leaders of Italian maritime republics such as Venice, Genoa and Padua from the 7th to 19th century. It shared the same root as the title duke, in the Latin dux and Greek doux, both simply meaning leader.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Doge is portrayed by [[Peter Cartwright]] in {{OOTP|FA}} and [[David Ryall]] in {{DH|F1}}.<ref>[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2009/7/19/deathly-hallows-updates-stan-as-krum-returns-doge-is-cast-and-more Deathly Hallows Updates: Krum Returns, Doge is Cast and More]</ref>\n*In {{LEGO|Y2}}, his talk with Harry about Dumbledore's childhood during the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour]] is omitted.\n*In {{DH|F1}}, when the wedding is interrupted, and before Elphias Disapparates, he says \"Nice meeting you, Mr Potter\". This causes a mistake in the film since in the fifth film they had already seen each other when Harry was being rescued from the Dursleys. Although, they may not have actually spoken to each other upon Harry's rescue, and therefore did not officially \"meet\" each other until the seventh film.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Elphias Doge}}\n*{{OOTP}} {{1st}}\n*{{OOTP|F}}\n*{{DH}}\n*{{DH|F1}}\n*{{DH|G1}} {{Mention}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}}\n*{{PM}}\n*{{WW}} \n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Ministry Level 10 employees}}\n{{Order of the Phoenix}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doge, Elphias}}\n\n[[de:Elphias Doge]]\n[[es:Elphias Doge]]\n[[fr:Elphias Doge]]\n[[ru:\u042d\u043b\u0444\u0438\u0430\u0441 \u0414\u043e\u0436]]\n[[pl:Elfias Doge]]\n[[ja:\u30a8\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9\u30fb\u30c9\u30fc\u30b8]]\n[[Category:1880s births]]\n[[Category:Advance Guard]]\n[[Category:Blue-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Centenarians]]\n[[Category:Doge family]]\n[[Category:First Order of the Phoenix]]\n[[Category:Grey-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pure-bloods]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1892]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]\n[[Category:Wizengamot members]]"
