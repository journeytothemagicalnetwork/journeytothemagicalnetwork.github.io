He started when famous student [[Harry Potter]] was in his fourth year of schooling and Nigel was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into Gryffindor house. Nigel also appeared to have a great deal of respect for the school headmaster. During [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s welcoming speech, Nigel seemed completely captivated. This was in contrast with the other students who were getting distracted by friends, floating candles, and the Great Hall's enchanted ceiling.<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n\n[[File:Nigel 11.jpg|249x249px|thumb|Nigel trying to get Harry Potter's autograph]]\n\nNigel had also shown an interest in Harry Potter (who was dubbed the 'Boy Who Lived') and had asked [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] if he could get him Harry's autograph. Ron agreed to get him Harry's autograph in exchange for Nigel bringing Ron his mail that day, which Nigel did. It is unknown if he ever got Harry's autograph. Ron dismissed him after getting his mail and said they would talk about it later. Nigel then left looking very disappointed.<ref name=\"GOF\">{{GOF|F}}</ref>\n\nNigel was seen supporting champion Harry Potter throughout the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. For instance, when Nigel was cheering for Harry after he emerged from the lake, [[Draco Malfoy]] hit Nigel over the head and pulled his hat down over his face in irritation.<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n\nAlso, despite being only a first year Nigel attended the [[Yule Ball]]. This means he must have been asked by someone much older than him, as third year [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] accepted [[Neville Longbottom]]'s offer. Ginny doubted she had to be asked by anyone else and being so young she would not have been allowed to attend otherwise. Only fourth years or older could attend the ball.<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n\n[[File:Nigelparvati.png|242x242px|thumb|left|Nigel and Ron supporting Harry during the third task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]]]]\n\nAt the end of the year Nigel was supposed to have his first ever [[End-of-Term Feast]], but due to the circumstances surrounding the Triwizard Tournament and them resulting in the murder of [[Cedric Diggory]], this feast was cancelled and instead a [[Memorial feast to Cedric Diggory|memorial feast]] was held by [[Albus Dumbledore]] for students and staff to pay their respects to the late Diggory and grieve the loss. At the end of this year Dumbledore had declared, based on Harry Potter's word, that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned to power.<ref name=\"GOF\"/> Nigel was amongst the students to believe this claim and not be persuaded otherwise by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' which in later months would slate Harry and Dumbledore as liars.<ref name=\"OOTPF\">{{OOTP|F}}</ref>\n\n====Second year====\n{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|Stunning is sort of the wizard's bread and butter really. So, come on then Nigel, give it your best shot.|Nigel|Er, ''STUPEFY''!|Harry teaching the [[Stunning Spell]] to the D.A.|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)}}\nThe following year, [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] would be put under the watchful eyes of [[Dolores Umbridge]], the newly Ministry-appointed [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor]] and [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher. Umbridge was making the students' lives a misery and was refusing to teach them any practical forms of Defence Against the Dark Arts. When [[Harry Potter]] and [[Hermione Granger]] set up an organisation against this Nigel joined and became a part of Dumbledore's Army.<ref name=\"OOTPF\"/>\n\n[[File:Nigel harry da.jpg|245x245px|thumb|Nigel standing next to Harry during a Dumbledore's Army meeting]]\n\nWhen attending the [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]]'s meetings Nigel would often stay close to Harry, whom he looked up to. With Nigel's enthusiasm in lessons Harry would often use him as a 'test dummy', such as to demonstrate the Stunning Spell. He also assisted Harry by acting as a look-out as the students left the [[Room of Requirement]] at the end of the meetings. When Dolores Umbridge and her [[Inquisitorial Squad]] discovered the D.A. meetings, Nigel was at the front of the class along with Harry. He was among the students to serve one of [[Dolores Umbridge|Umbridge]]'s 'medieval' detentions as punishment for being a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]]. Towards the end of the year [[Fred and George Weasley]] put their plans of escape into action and Nigel was amongst the crowd of students and staff to witness their departure and cheered them off after they turned a school corridor into a swamp.<ref name=\"OOTPF\"/>\n\n====Third year====\n[[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-nigel tryouts.jpg|250x250px|thumb|left|Nigel at [[Quidditch]] tryouts standing next to Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas]]\n\nDuring Nigel's third year his idol [[Harry Potter]] became the new [[Quidditch Captain|Captain]] for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. Nigel was present at the [[Quidditch]] tryouts that year but did not make the team, however he did not take the news badly and was quite happy with the selected students. Nigel was later shown to be very supportive of the team. He was seen cheering loudly for [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] when he won his first Quidditch match. He also witnessed Ron and [[Lavender Brown]] passionately kissing for the first time in the Gryffindor common room, something which he showed disgust in by poking his tongue out and covering his face with his woolly hat to block his view.<ref name=\"HBPF\">{{HBP|F}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HP6-TRLF5-2342.jpg|250x250px|thumb|Nigel with [[Luna Lovegood]] and Madam Pomfrey raising their wands to the late Professor Dumbledore]]\n\nNigel was also still present at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] when [[Professor]] [[Severus Snape]] killed the school's current headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]]. After hearing the news and seeing the [[Dark Mark]] floating above the school he and a large group of students and staff gathered around Dumbledore's body, which had fallen from the [[Astronomy Tower]], Nigel arrived at the place with Luna Lovegood and stood with her and [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] whilst the crowd looked on at Harry who had crouched down to Dumbledore.<ref name=\"HBPF\"/>\n\nWhen the time came, Nigel followed [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]'s sign of respect and lit his wand and raised his arm in the air with the crowd of students to show their respects to the late headmaster. In doing so the combined faculty and students of Hogwarts managed to rid the sky of the over-looking Dark Mark. It is more than likely that Nigel attended the funeral service that followed afterwards unless his parents pulled him out of school before the year had finished, like some others had done.<ref name=\"HBPF\"/>\n\n====Fourth year====\n[[File:Nigel_vrai_!!!!!!!!!!!!!.jpg|thumb|Nigel announcing Harry's arrival at Hogwarts]]\nIn Nigel's fourth year, he was still at Hogwarts and was a member of Dumbledore's Army. He was seen on the train ride on [[1 September]] with [[Seamus Finnigan]].<ref name=\"DHF2\">{{DH|F2}}</ref>\n\n===Battle of Hogwarts===\n[[File:Da On the bridge.jpg|245x245px|thumb|left|Nigel with D.A. members defending the [[Wooden Bridge]] during the Battle]]\nOn 2 May, he greeted Harry when the latter arrived in the Room of Requirement prior to the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], and also served as a communicator to members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. Nigel participated in the battle alongside his friends against the Death Eaters and Voldemort's army of Dark creatures.<ref name=\"DHF2\"/> Nigel was not listed among the 50 casualties, and presumably survived to witness Harry's final defeat of Lord Voldemort and the end of the Second Wizarding War.<ref name=\"lives\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCXJ_IMoy3E Leaky Con 2012: Interview with HP Actors]</ref>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Since Nigel trained with [[Dumbledore's Army]] under the instruction of [[Harry Potter]], he would have been skilled with defensive and offensive spells. When he was only twelve (in his second year), Nigel successfully used the [[Stunning Spell]] on Harry.<ref name=\"OOTPF\"/> He was also skilled and confident enough in this field to successfully duel against many [[Death Eaters]] alongside with his friends during the Battle of Hogwarts.<ref name=\"DHF2\"/>\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': Despite his young age, Nigel was a surprisingly confident duellist who fought bravely in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against Voldemort's dangerous army of Death Eaters.<ref name=\"DHF2\"/> He likely survived the battle, as his name was not mentioned among the [[Fallen Fifty]].\n\n==Possessions==\n*'''[[Nigel Wolpert's wand|Wand]]''': Nigel owned a [[wand]] of an unknown length, [[wand wood]] and [[Wand core|core]].<ref name=\"OOTPF\"/>\n*'''[[Nigel Wolpert's owl|Owl]]''': Nigel owned a pet [[owl]], which he owned during his time as a [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] student.<ref name=\"OOTPF\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n*\"''Nigel''\" is derived from the Latin \"''Nigellus''\"''.''\n*The name Nigel also has Scottish origin in which it means \"''Champion''\".\n*The name Wolpert means \"''descendent of Waldobert''\".<ref>[http://surnames.meaning-of-names.com/wolpert/ Wolpert Meaning & Surname Resources]</ref>\n*\"''Waldobert''\" is a Germanic name composed of the elements \"''wald''\", meaning \"''rule''\", and \"''beraht''\", meaning \"''bright''\". It was the name of a 7th-century French saint.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/gaubert behindthename.com: Gaubert]</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Nigel Wolpert is portrayed by [[William Melling]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Half-Blood Prince]]'' and in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|Deathly Hallows: Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|2]]''. He has only ever appeared in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]], never in any of the [[Harry Potter (book series)|novels]]. Nigel seems to fill a role as composite replacement for both [[Colin Creevey|Colin]] and [[Dennis Creevey]].\n*While the script called for Nigel to die during the Battle of Hogwarts and be carried into the Great Hall (like Colin was in the book),<ref name=\"SK\">[https://www.scribd.com/doc/163084623/29/INT-DIAGON-ALLEY-DARK-ALLEY-MORNING-189-189 ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2'' script]</ref> William Melling noted at LeakyCon 2012 that he had grown so much that he was no longer able to fit the description and his death was not portrayed.<ref name=\"lives\" />\n*In {{OOTP|FA}}, Nigel attends the first meeting of what would become Dumbledore's Army in the Hog's Head, despite the fact that he would have only been a second year at the time, meaning he would not have been allowed to go to Hogsmeade.\n*[[William Melling]] has a non-speaking role in the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|sixth film]] and he is shown several times in the background. He originally was present in the bathroom during Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter's duel, but he was later cut from this scene.<ref>[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2008/9/7/detailed-report-from-half-blood-prince-test-screening Detailed Report From \"Half-Blood Prince\" Test Screening]</ref>\n*Nigel appears in both parts of the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (film)|film adaptation]] of {{DH}}: in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|Part 1]]'' he appears on the Hogwarts Express as a non-speaking character, in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Part 2]]'' he appears in the [[Room of Requirement]] with the rest of the [[Dumbledore's Army]]. His only line is: \"Lightning has struck, I repeat, lightning has struck!\", as he announces Harry's arrival. He says this when he warns the other students and the Order of the Phoenix of Harry Potter's arrival.\n**It should be noted that Nigel's role in {{DH|F2}} seems to fill the role [[Lee Jordan]] had in the novel.\n*Storyboards for {{OOTP|FA}} drawn by Nick Pelham consistently refer to Nigel as \"Philip\". Whether a different character was originally intended for this scene, Nigel was going to be renamed, or this was simply an error on the artist's part is unclear.<ref>[http://nickpelham.co.uk/hp5_2.html ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' storyboards on Nick Pelham's official site]</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Nigel Wolpert}}\n*{{GOF|F}} {{1st}}\n*{{OOTP|F}}\n*{{OOTP|G}} {{Comment|Appears in Game Manual}} {{Comment|Name appears on [[Dumbledore's Army parchment|parchment]]}}\n*{{HBP|F}}\n*{{DH|F1}}\n*{{DH|F2}}\n*{{DH|G2}}\n*[[Harry Potter: The Wand Collection]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wolpert, Nigel}}\n\n{{Dumbledore's Army}}\n\n[[de:Nigel]]\n[[es:Nigel Wolpert]]\n[[fr:Nigel]]\n[[ru:\u041d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0436\u0435\u043b]]\n[[pl:Nigel Wolpert]]\n[[Category:1980s births]]\n[[Category:Battle of Hogwarts participants]]\n[[Category:Blue-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Dumbledore's Army]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1994]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]\n[[Category:Wolpert family]]"
