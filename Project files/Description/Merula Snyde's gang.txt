This gang was overall very inefficient in carrying out its intended purpose.<ref name=\"y3ch2\"/>\n\n==Known members==\n*[[Merula Snyde]] (Founder/Leader)<ref name=\"y3ch2\"/>\n*[[Barnaby Lee]]<ref name=\"y3ch2\"/> (formerly)<ref name=\"y3ch8\">{{HM|3|8}}</ref>\n*[[Ismelda Murk]]<ref name=\"y3ch2\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[Jacob's sibling]] first encountered Merula Snyde's gang during the [[Wideye Potion]] lesson in the [[1986\u20131987 school year]] at Hogwarts. Merula sarcastically welcomed back Jacob's sibling, while stating her new associates, [[Ismelda Murk]] and [[Barnaby Lee]], would assist her in opening the remaining [[Cursed Vaults]].\n\nAfter the class, they discussed what could possibly be in the next vaults, to which Merula rudely stated that it could be something that can bring back [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]]. Regardless of Jacob's sibling's reponse, Merula's gang left, with the exception of Barnaby, staying back to threaten Jacob's sibling with \"vanishing every bone\" in their body should they continue to interfere with Merula's plans. Jacob's sibling attempted to reason with Barnaby by pointing out that Merula was terrible to everyone around her and she was most likely lying to Barnaby in order to manipulate him. Barnaby pondered on Jacob's sibling statement for a moment, before rebuffing them and leaving the class.<ref name=\"y3ch2\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{HM}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[ja:\u30e1\u30eb\u30fc\u30e9\u30fb\u30b9\u30ca\u30a4\u30c9\u306e\u4e00\u56e3]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Cliques]]\n[[Category:Pure-blood supremacists]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]"
