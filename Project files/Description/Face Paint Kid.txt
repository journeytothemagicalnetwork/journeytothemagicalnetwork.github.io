He preferred being known by that moniker rather than his birth name.\n\nA huge fan of [[Quidditch]], he was known for testing other students' knowledge of the sport with what he called his \"patented quidditch quiz\" and for wearing elaborate face paint during matches. \n\nDuring the [[1985\u20131986 school year]], before [[Jacob's sibling]] attended their first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, he [[Face Paint Kid's patented Quidditch Quiz|quizzed]] them on their knowledge. Unfortunately, his face paint design for that match didn't turn out as he had hoped, but [[Penny Haywood]] helped him by using the [[Colour Change Charm]] to correct it to his [[Hogwarts Houses|House]] colours.<ref name=\"HM\">{{HM}}</ref>\n\nWhen Jacob's sibling became a [[Beater]] in the [[1986\u20131987 school year]] and a [[Keeper]] in the [[1987\u20131988 school year]], Face Paint Kid quizzed them two more times, each on [[Face Paint Kid's Beater Quidditch Quiz|Beater]] and [[Face Paint Kid's Keeper Quidditch Quiz|Keeper knowledge]].<ref name=\"HM3Q21\">{{HM|3|Q2|1}}</ref><ref name=\"HM4Q31\">{{HM|4|Q3|1}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*He is in whichever house the player chose for [[Jacob's sibling]].\n*He likes nicknames.\n*According to [[Penny Haywood]], Face Paint Kid is an even bigger [[Quidditch]] fan than she is, and creates the coolest face paint designs.\n*Even though [[Jacob's sibling]] had just joined his 'Quidditch Fans' group and almost immediately the Quidditch Team, they became his favourite player.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{HM}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Stub}}\n[[ru:\u0423\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0441 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043b\u0438\u0446\u043e\u043c]]\n[[Category:1970s births]]\n[[Category:Blue-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Unidentified Hogwarts Students]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
