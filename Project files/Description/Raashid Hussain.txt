Hussain is an Arabic surname and given name and means \"handsome\". Due to this, we can assume that Raashid was of Arabic origin.\n*It is possible Raashid is of South Asian Muslim background as most British citizens with Arabic names are likely to be from Afghani, [[Bangladesh]]i or [[Pakistan]]i origin.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{PS2 only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hussain, Raashid}}\n[[pl:Raashid Hussain]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Hufflepuffs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
