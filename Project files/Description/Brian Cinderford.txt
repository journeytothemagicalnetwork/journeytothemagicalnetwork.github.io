It was borne by the semi-legendary Irish king Brian Boru, who thwarted Viking attempts to conquer Ireland in the 11th century. He was slain in the Battle of Clontarf, though his forces were decisively victorious. The name was common in Ireland before his time, and even more so afterwards. It came into use in England in the Middle Ages, introduced by Breton settlers.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{PS2 only}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cinderford, Brian}}\n[[pl:Brian Cinderford]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizard Skittles Players]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
