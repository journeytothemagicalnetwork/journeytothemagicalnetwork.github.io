She was soon engaging in bullying her fellow students, including [[Daniel Page]].<ref name=\"video\">[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PeXSF4kpCqk YouTube - Harry Potter: Magic Awakened]</ref>\n\nShe overheard Daniel speaking to [[Unidentified 2000s Hogwarts student|a friend]] one day about how he thought hiding magic from [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s was wrong. Cassandra began teasing Daniel, asking if he wanted to be in the paper or be a criminal. Cassandra thought Muggles to be \"silly\" and frightened of their own shadows. Daniel objected, saying she would be afraid of magic if she didn't have it.<ref name=\"video\" />\n\nCassandra worked out that he had a Muggle in the [[Page family]], and he told her to shut up. Daniel's friend didn't think Cassandra was worth it, and [[Ivy Warrington]] asked if she didn't like non-magic people. Cassandra told her she did, because she had an uncle who was a Muggle and she thought he was hilarious.<ref name=\"video\" />\n\nCassandra left, but Ivy run after her and started duelling her. Ivy used [[Vanishing Spell|''Evanesco'']] and nearly hurt Cassandra. [[Neville Longbottom|Professor Longbottom]] intervened and gave [[Discipline at Hogwarts|detention]] to Ivy and her friends.<ref name=\"video\" />\n\nLater that evening, Cassandra, [[Colby Frey|Colby]] and [[Fischer Frey]] snuck out to the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]]. Daniel, Ivy and their friend found out and went to check out why. They watched her until one of the twins noticed. Cassandra then told Daniel's friends she had found out about Daniel's family who had been sent to prison. Daniel then began duelling Cassandra.<ref name=\"video\" />\n\nCassandra lost the duel, and told Daniel it wasn't over and that he couldn't be trusted.<ref name=\"video\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nCassandra had a mean-spirited and conceited personality, and enjoyed belitting those she perceived as below her with her friends, such as [[Daniel Page]].<ref name=\"video\"/> She disliked the sport of [[Quidditch]] and enjoyed [[Herbology]].<ref name=\"info\"/>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': Cassandra had some ability in the field of duelling, although she did once lose a duel to her rival [[Daniel Page]].<ref name=\"video\"/>\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Cassandra was able to produce a corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] in the form of a [[mink]], an exceptional feat of [[magic]] for a Hogwarts student.<ref name=\"info\"/>\n*'''[[Herbology]]''': Cassandra was known to enjoy the study of Herbology at Hogwarts, the study of magical plants and fungi.<ref name=\"info\"/>\n\n==Possessions==\n*'''[[Cassandra Vole's wand|Wand]]''': Cassandra's [[wand]] was 10 inches, made of [[holly]] with a [[Veela hair]] [[Wand core|core]].<ref name=\"info\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{MA}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vole, Cassandra}}\n[[ja:\u30ab\u30b5\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30fb\u30f4\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb]]\n[[ru:\u041a\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430]]\n[[Category:1990s births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Green-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 2008]]\n[[Category:Vole family]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
