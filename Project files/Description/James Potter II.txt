Thus, any children she had would be their second cousins, and second cousins once removed of their sons Sirius and Regulus. Also, almost all of Sirius's relatives can be seen on the Black family tree as both his parents were born into the House of Black, making it unlikely that he could be related to Arthur in a way not shown.

He was named in honour of his paternal grandfather and his father's godfather. \n\n[[File:The Potters at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup final.png|250px|thumb|left|James attends the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]] with his family]]\nIn 2014, James, along with his family, attended the finale of the Quidditch World Cup in the Patagonian Desert. A few days before the match, his father introduced him and his younger brother [[Albus Potter|Albus]] to the [[Bulgarian National Quidditch team]] [[Seeker]], and an old associate of his father, [[Viktor Krum]]. James along with the rest of his family, with the exception of his mother (who was in the journalists' enclosure) and Albus (who was wearing Brazilian green), sported Bulgarian red. \n\nJames laughed when Albus almost toppled out of the VIP box cheering when [[Gon\u00e7alo Flores]] scored the first goal of the game, but his uncle [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] grabbed the back of his robes and saved him. Due to James laughing, ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' correspondent [[Rita Skeeter]] (who was covering the match live with Ginny) suggested that he may have pushed Albus.<ref name=\"the-qwc2014-final\">[[2014 Quidditch World Cup final]] from {{PM}} {{see image|File:Quidditch_World_Cup_Final_(Evening_Prophet).png}}</ref> James was seen applauding after Bulgaria won the tournament.\n\n===Hogwarts years {{C|2015\u2013?}}===\n{{Dialogue a-b-c|Albus Potter|I ''won't''!

You are ''so'' like Ron \u2014|Ginny regarding her son's personality|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\nJames was much very like his uncle ([[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]), in terms of his poor timing and knack for interfering with other people's love lives. He also seemed to have inherited his good sense of humour and love of mischief from his two uncles, [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]]. \n\nHe was also very much like his two namesakes, in his mischievous and trouble-making nature. He was shown to be very teasing, particularly towards his younger brother, often making comments to worry him about Hogwarts. Unlike his brother, James appeared to be rather independent and confident about himself. Harry remarked that, \"''everything comes easy for James''\", suggesting that he was easygoing and popular with others his own age.  \n\n==Possessions==\n[[File:Marauders Map.png|200px|thumb|The Marauder's Map]]\n*'''[[Marauder's Map]]''': The Marauder's Map was made by his [[James Potter I|grandfather]] and namesake James, along with his friends during their time at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. It once belonged to his father Harry and was one of his most treasured possessions. At some point, he stole the map out of his father's desk.\n*'''[[Wand]]''': It can be assumed that before boarding the Hogwarts Express, James and his family travelled to Ollivander's wand shop in Diagon Alley and there he bought his wand. His wand was of an unknown length, wood, and core type. \n*'''[[James Potter II's owl|Owl]]''': When boarding the Hogwarts Express it was shown that he had an owl in a cage resting on top of his school bag and trunk.<ref name=\"DHE\"/>\n*'''[[Cloak of Invisibility]]''': Before starting his sixth year at Hogwarts, James was given his [[Potter family|family]]'s invisibility cloak from his father. His younger [[Albus Potter|brother]] stole it from him at some point during the year from James' trunk after correctly guessing the combination, which was the year he got his first broom. \n*'''[[James Potter II's comb|Comb]]''': James was gifted a comb by [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] the night before he was to return to Hogwarts. This comb was presumably a joke item, as it made his hair turn a shade of pink.<ref name=\"CC17\">{{CC|B|1|7}}</ref>\n\n==Relationships==\n===Family===\n====The Potters====\n{{Dialogue|James Potter|Slythering Slytherin, stop with your dithering, time to get on the train.|Harry Potter|Unnecessary, James.|James teasing Albus about being in Slytherin|Harry Potter and the Cursed Child}}\n[[File:Potter family1.png|250px|thumb|left|James with his parents and siblings]]\nJames had a very strong connection with both of his parents, even though he did not want to show it in front of other people. Still, he permitted his parents' hugs and kisses, before rushing off to the [[Hogwarts Express]] in [[2017]].<ref name=\"DHE\"/> He also wrote to them three times a week the previous year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. His parents often chastised him for teasing his brother and James usually stopped at their glares, suggesting that he knew not to push his boundaries with them.\n\nJames was the oldest of three children, and he enjoyed teasing his younger siblings [[Albus Potter|Albus]] and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily]]. However, he was on good terms with both of them. James was willing to move into Albus's room if Teddy moved in; Harry, however, thought such an act would be a disaster, saying that James and Albus \"''will share a room only when I want the house demolished.''\" This might imply that James and Albus frequently argued with one another \u2014 more than what was seen at King's Cross in 2017, anyway.\n\n====The Weasleys====\nJames had many cousins, like [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] who was close in age with his brother and in the same year at Hogwarts, and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]], who is the same age as his sister, Lily.\n\n===Teddy Lupin===\nWhen James saw [[Edward Lupin|Teddy]] kissing [[Victoire Weasley]], he ran to tell his family, but he was disappointed with their reaction. However, he shared his younger sister's and Albus's desire for Teddy to become an official member of the extended [[Potter family|Potter]]-[[Weasley family|Weasley]] family.<ref name=\"DHE\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n*'''''James''''' is a Hebrew name from the name Jacob (\u05d9\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05e7\u05b9\u05d1), meaning ''\"Heel\"'' as in Genesis narrative, Jacob was born grasping Esau's heel and later bought his birthright. This was the name of James's grandfather and the middle name of his father.\n*'''''Sirius''''' is the meaning of ''\"Star\"'' as it is the brightest star seen from Earth, it is also the Dog Star from Ancient Greek Mythology as he was Orion's dog. This is the name of James's father's godfather.\n*Potter is a very common surname of English origin. It traditionally refers to the occupation of making pottery. Beatrix Potter was a well-known English children's author.\n*Potter's Field is the name for a burial ground for the unknown or unclaimed dead, particularly soldiers and orphans; the Potter family had many members that fit that description.\n*The Potter Box is a model for making ethical decisions developed at Harvard University.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Tom-Milligan-572x714.jpg|150px|thumb|Tom Milligan, who portrays James in [[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (play)|Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]]]\n*James is portrayed in the film {{DH|F2}} by [[Will Dunn]].\n*James is portrayed in {{CC|P1}} by [[Tom Milligan]].\n*James Potter II is the main character of the [[James Potter (series)|''James Potter'' series]], a non-canonical continuation of the ''Harry Potter'' series endorsed by (though not actually connected or affiliated with) [[J. K. Rowling]].<ref>[http://www.elderscrossing.com/wizard.html The James Potter series]</ref>\n*James was given the names of two Marauders and it is said that he stole the [[Marauder's Map]] from his father's desk drawer. It is unknown if he shared the map with his [[James Potter II's friends|friends]] or [[Potter family|siblings]].\n*It is also interesting to note that James picked on his younger brother Albus, who was named partially after Severus Snape, just like how his paternal grandfather James Potter I picked on Severus Snape. It is also implied that they occasionally quarrel since their father wouldn't let James share his room with Albus and added that he would do so if he wanted their house demolished.\n*On 1 September 2015, J.K. Rowling tweeted that James was starting at Hogwarts, officially marking the year that James started Hogwarts, also revealing his age and year.\n*[[Sirius Black]], his half-namesake and father's godfather, is also his third cousin once removed through his mother Ginny. They are also related through [[Lucretia Black]], James's great-great aunt by marriage and second cousin twice removed and Sirius's aunt by blood. He is also related in some way to [[Dorea Black]], from his father's side.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of James Potter II}}\n*{{DH}} {{1st}}\n*{{DH|F2}}\n*{{DH|G2}} {{Mention}}\n*{{CC}}\n*{{CC|P}}\n*''[[J.K.
