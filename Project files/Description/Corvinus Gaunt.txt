[[18th century]]) was a [[pure-blood]]<ref name=\"HBP10\"/> [[wizardkind|wizard]], and a member of the [[pure-blood]] [[House of Gaunt]]. As such, he was one of the direct descendants of [[Salazar Slytherin]] and was a [[Parseltongue|Parselmouth]], as well as being presumably very inbred and rich (assuming their wealth has yet to be completely squandered from grandeur and lack of sense). Gaunt knew about the [[Chamber of Secrets]], and he was instrumental in keeping the entrance to the Chamber a secret.<ref name=\"Pottermore\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nIn the [[18th century|1700s]], there was a proposal to install an elaborate [[plumbing]] system at [[Hogwarts Castle]]. This, of course, threatened the secrecy around the entrance to the [[Chamber of Secrets]] which, at the time, still had its original appearance \u2014 a concealed trapdoor and a series of magical tunnels \u2014 and which was located on the site where a [[Moaning Myrtle's Bathroom|girls' bathroom]] would be set up.<ref name=\"Pottermore\">{{WW|chamber-of-secrets}}</ref>\n\nCorvinus Gaunt was, at the time, a student at Hogwarts and, as a descendant of [[Salazar Slytherin]] himself, knew where the entrance to the Chamber was and how to open it. Corvinus was responsible for secretly protecting the entrance, having concealed it behind plumbing fixtures and a sink (which today are part of [[Moaning Myrtle's Bathroom]]), so that those who knew how could still access the Chamber.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\n==Personality==\nCorvinus appeared to be sufficiently intelligent, as he was able to learn the location of the Chamber of Secrets that has not been found by centuries of searching. He was also able to adapt the new plumbing system into hiding the Chamber from the school staff in a discreet manner. Likewise, he seemed to be mentally stable despite inbreeding (as he was born at least in the early stages of the practice, thus not enough to damage his genes) enough to attend Hogwarts.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\nHis willingness to hide the Chamber that was meant to drive off all Muggle-borns from Hogwarts indicate his belief in [[pure-blood supremacy]].<ref name=\"Pottermore\" /> Despite this he never sought to open the Chamber himself suggesting that, while ill-intentioned, he was unwilling to be the one responsible for the deaths of all the Muggle-borns.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Parseltongue]]''': Being a descendant of [[Salazar Slytherin]], Corvinus was a natural born Parselmouth, being able to [[magic]]ally communicate with [[snake]]s along with most of his ancestors and relatives. He was able to use his ability to speak Parseltongue to cleverly conceal the opening to the [[Chamber of Secrets]], and would have been able to open it himself, though he never did.<ref name=\"Pottermore\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n*\"Corvinus\" is the diminutive of \"Corvus\", which derives from Latin ''corvus'', \"raven\". {{wplink|Matthias Corvinus}} was a 15th-century Hungarian king, possibly referring to Corvinus' status as a [[pure-blood]], as many pure-bloods consider themselves akin to royalty. Also, {{wplink|Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus}} was a Roman general, author and patron of literature and art.\n*The word ''gaunt'' is defined as \"haggard, drawn and emaciated\" and \"bleak, desolate\".\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*As a member of the House of Gaunt, Corvinus presumably owned [[Salazar Slytherin's Locket]], and possibly owned [[Marvolo Gaunt's Ring]], assuming the latter had passed into the family's possession by this time.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{PM}} {{1st Mention}}\n*{{WW}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Gaunt, Corvinus}}\n[[ru:\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0432\u0438\u043d \u041c\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0441]]\n[[de:Corvinus Gaunt]] \n[[fr:Corvinus Gaunt]]\n[[pl:Corvinus Gaunt]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Gaunt family]]\n[[Category:Historical figures]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Parselmouths]]\n[[Category:Pure-blood supremacists]]\n[[Category:Pure-bloods]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
