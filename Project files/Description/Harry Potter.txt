[[31 July]] [[1980]])<ref name=\"PM-HP\" /> was an [[England|English]] [[half-blood]]<ref name=\"blood\" /> [[Wizardkind|wizard]], and one of the most famous wizards of modern times. The only child and son of [[James and Lily Potter]] {{c|n\u00e9e [[Evans family|Evans]]}}, Harry's birth was overshadowed by a [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|prophecy]], naming either himself or [[Neville Longbottom]] as the one with the power to vanquish [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], the most powerful and feared [[Dark Wizard|dark wizard]] in the world. After half of the prophecy was reported to Voldemort, courtesy of [[Severus Snape]], Harry was chosen as the target due to his many similarities with the Dark Lord. In turn, this caused the [[Potter family]] to go into hiding.  \n\nVoldemort made his [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)|first attempt]] to circumvent the prophecy when Harry was a year and three months old. During this attempt, he murdered Harry's parents as they tried to protect him, but this unsuccessful attempt to kill Harry led to Voldemort's first downfall. This downfall marked the end of the [[First Wizarding War]], and to Harry henceforth being known as \"The Boy Who Lived\",<ref name=\"PS1\" /> as he was the only known survivor of the [[Killing Curse]] due to being magically protected by his mother's [[sacrificial protection|loving sacrifice.]]  As per the terms of the prophecy, this attempt on his life also established him, not Neville, as Voldemort's nemisis.  \n\nOne consequence of Lily's sacrifice was that her orphaned son had to be raised by her only remaining blood relative, his [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] aunt [[Petunia Dursley]]. While in her care, he would be protected from Lord Voldemort due to the [[Bond of blood charm|Bond of Blood]] charm [[Albus Dumbledore]] placed upon him.<ref name=\"OOTP37\">{{OOTP|B|37}}</ref> This powerful charm would protect him until he became of age, or no longer called his aunt's house home. Due to Petunia's resentment of her sister and her magic gifts, Harry grew up abused and neglected. \n\nOn his eleventh birthday, Harry learned that he was a wizard from [[Rubeus Hagrid]].<ref name=\"PS4\">{{PS|B|4}}</ref> He began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]]. The [[Sorting Hat]] hat told Harry that he would do well in [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]], but Harry pleaded 'not Slytherin' and the Hat heeded this plea, instead sorting the young wizard into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]].<ref name=\"PS7\">{{PS|B|7}}</ref> At school, Harry became best friends with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]]. He later became the youngest [[Quidditch]] Seeker in over a century and eventually the [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|captain]] of the Gryffindor House Quidditch Team in his [[sixth year]], winning two [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cups]].<ref>{{OOTP}} - In Harry's fifth year, Professor Umbridge banned him from participations in Quidditch games, along with Fred and George Weasley. Thus, Harry was not on the team when they won the cup that year.</ref> He became even better known in his early years for protecting the [[Philosopher's Stone]] from Voldemort, saving Ron's sister [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], solving the mystery of the [[Chamber of Secrets]], slaying [[Salazar Slytherin]]'s [[Serpent of Slytherin|basilisk]], and learning how to conjure a corporeal stag [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] at the age of thirteen. In his fourth year, Harry won the [[Triwizard Tournament]], although the competition ended with the tragic death of [[Cedric Diggory]] and the [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return]] of Voldemort. During the next school year, Harry reluctantly taught and led [[Dumbledore's Army]]. He also fought in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], during which he lost his godfather, [[Sirius Black]].\n\nHarry played a significant role in many other battles of the [[Second Wizarding War]]. He, Ron, and Hermione hunted down and destroyed Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es. During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Harry personally saw the deaths of [[Severus Snape]] and [[Fred Weasley]] while learning that [[Remus Lupin]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Colin Creevey]], and many [[Fallen Fifty|others]] had fallen in battle as well. He encountered Voldemort and nearly sacrificed himself, knowing that his doing so was the only way to destroy the fragment of Voldemort's soul inside of him. In [[limbo]], after Voldemort cursed him in the [[Forbidden Forest|forest clearing]], Dumbledore gave Harry advice and background information on the Dark Lord. When told he could choose to live or to \"move on\", Harry chose to live. After he awoke, Harry confronted Voldemort and defeated him once and for all. \n\nHarry was also noted for being the only known [[Master of Death]], having united the three [[Deathly Hallows]] at the mere age of seventeen.\n\nAfter the war, Harry became an [[Auror]] and helped reform and revolutionise the [[Ministry of Magic]].<ref name=\"TODAY\" /> At some point, he married Ginny, with whom he had three children: [[James Potter II|James Sirius]], [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus]], and [[Lily L.

In [[2007]], Harry was promoted to Head of the [[Auror Office]] at the age of 26,<ref>Harry joined the Aurors at age 17 in 1998, right after the Battle of Hogwarts.

Linfred was given the nickname \"Potterer\", which over the years was changed simply to \"Potter\". The family took on the simplified nickname as a surname, thus leading to future generations calling themselves Potter.<ref name=\"Pottermore\"/>\n\nThe Potters were also descended from the [[Peverell family]], via [[Hardwin Potter]]'s marriage to [[Iolanthe Peverell]].<ref name=\"Pottermore\"/> As such, they are related to [[Ignotus Peverell]], one of the three brothers that created the [[Deathly Hallows]], who passed the [[Cloak of Invisibility]] down to his descendants as a family heirloom. The [[House of Gaunt|Gaunt family]] were also descended from the Peverells through [[Cadmus Peverell]], who passed the [[Resurrection Stone]] as an heirloom, set in a [[Marvolo Gaunt's Ring|signet ring]].<ref name=\"HBP10\">{{HBP|B|10}}</ref> The Potters were thus indirectly related to the Gaunts as well, and by extension [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]].<ref name=\"chat2\">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0730-bloomsbury-chat.html J.K. Rowling and the Live Chat, Bloomsbury.com, July 30, 2007]</ref>\n\nBefore the start of the [[17th century]], some of Harry's ancestors migrated to the [[United States of America|United States]], and held strong ties with the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America]].<ref name=\"macusa\">{{WW|macusa}}</ref> These ties developed as a result of [[Abraham Potter]] being one of the original twelve [[Auror]]s of MACUSA. This distant relation of Harry's was uncovered by genealogists centuries after Abraham's death.<ref name=\"macusa\" />\n\nThe Potters were related to many other wizarding families in Britain, largely through the marriage of [[Charlus Potter]] to [[Dorea Black]], who was, in fact, the great-aunt of [[Sirius Black]], Harry's godfather and best friend of his father, James Potter. It is very likely that both Charlus and Dorea were closely related to Harry.\n\nTwo members of the Potter family had held positions on the [[Wizengamot]]. The first was [[Ralston Potter]] and the second [[Henry Potter]]. Harry inherited much wealth from his grandparents [[Fleamont Potter|Fleamont]] and [[Euphemia Potter|Euphemia]], as Fleamont invented [[Sleekeazy's Hair Potion]], which quadrupled the family gold.<ref name=\"Pottermore2\">{{WW|the-potter-family}}</ref> Harry's father [[James Potter I|James Potter]] was born late in couple's lives. By that time, his parents were both elderly (even by wizarding standards), and he grew up in a doting household to the point where he became a proud yet arrogant boy. But deep down, James was a good person.<ref name=\"JKR2\">[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript Leaky Cauldron: 30 July 2007 Webchat with J.K. Rowling]</ref>\n\nConversely, Harry's mother [[Lily J. Potter|Lily J. Evans]] was a [[Muggle-born]], who was introduced to the [[wizarding world]] via her friendship with [[Severus Snape]], who lived nearby. The discovery of Lily being a witch caused a rift between her and her older sister [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia]], who envied her abilities.<ref name=\"DH33\">{{DH|B|33}}</ref>\n\nJames and Lily met when they attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] together [[1971]]. Their relationship was a rocky one; while James was a popular student and talented [[Quidditch]] player, Lily was unimpressed with him. This had to do with James' hostile relationship with Snape, who was falling in with a [[gang of Slytherins]] aspiring to join the [[Death Eaters]].<ref name=\"OOTP\">{{OOTP}}</ref>\n\nBy their seventh year, James lost the less savoury aspects of his personality and was even appointed [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]], despite the fact that he had not been a prefect. This impressed Lily, who was appointed Head Girl, and the two began dating.<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\nThe couple eventually [[Wedding of James Potter I and Lily Evans|married]] after graduation in [[1978]], and served as members of the original [[Order of the Phoenix]] at the height of the [[First Wizarding War]]. They personally defied Voldemort on three occasions, the first being when they refused to join his cause when he tried to recruit them (possibly at Snape's request).\n\n===Early life {{C|1980\u20131991}}===\n{{Dialogue a-b|Harry|But what happened to Vol - Sorry, I mean, You-Know-Who?|Hagrid|Good question, Harry.

This gave him some of Voldemort's abilities such as the ability to speak [[Parseltongue]]. This event made Harry the only person to have survived the Killing Curse, thus giving him the title the \"Boy Who Lived\". The failed curse left a [[Harry Potter's scars|lightning-bolt scar]] on his forehead marking him as Voldemort's equal. The scar would be a bane and also a blessing to Harry in the years to come, as it opened a telepathic link between Lord Voldemort and himself, giving each some awareness of each other's thoughts.\n\n[[File:Hagrid delivers Harry.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Rubeus Hagrid]] delivering baby Harry to 4 Privet Drive]]\n[[Rubeus Hagrid]] rescued Harry from the house, partially destroyed by Voldemort's faulty killing curse, and was given specific orders from [[Albus Dumbledore]] to take him to his [[Petunia Dursley|aunt]] and [[Vernon Dursley|uncle]]. As Hagrid left, he was intercepted by [[Sirius Black]], a close friend of the Potters, who pleaded for Hagrid to give the baby to him, as he was the chosen guardian in the event of James and Lily's death. Hagrid refused, saying that he was under orders from Dumbledore to take Harry to his relatives. Sirius, though reluctant, relented and gave Hagrid his flying motorcycle to take Harry to [[Privet Drive]], and left to find Pettigrew, who subsequently faked his death and framed Sirius for his death and that of [[Peter Pettigrew's unidentified victims|twelve]] [[Non-magic people|Muggles]].<ref name=\"POA10\">{{POA|B|10}}</ref>\n\nHagrid delivered Harry to Dumbledore late on the evening of [[1 November]] [[1981]].<ref name=\"PS1\" /> Dumbledore left [[Albus Dumbledore's letter to Petunia Dursley|a letter of explanation]] to the family living in the house, the Dursleys, who did not want to take care of Harry.\n\n====Life at Privet Drive====\n{{Quote|I'm not having one in the house, Petunia!

They knew about it but refused to associate with wizards. They [[Muggle supremacy|proudly considered themselves a \"normal\" family]] and despised anything out of the ordinary even if it had nothing to do with wizards. They lied to Harry about his parents' death, claiming they had died in a car crash. They also claimed that the [[scar|lightning-bolt scar]] on Harry's forehead was from the same crash.<ref name=\"PS2\">{{PS|B|2}}</ref> Whenever Harry tried to remember it, all he could vaguely recall (as if he 'strained his memory') was a [[Killing Curse|green flash of light]] and a high, cold, laugh. He tried to understand what it was, or if it was from the car crash, but he simply could not. Petunia and Vernon Dursley, Harry's new guardians, forbade him from asking questions, particularly those regarding his parents. In addition, the Dursleys refused to have pictures of Lily and James, and did their best to avoid the subject of Harry's parents altogether.<ref>{{WW|vernon-and-petunia-dursley}}</ref> \n\nThey resented Harry for his [[magic]], which was sporadic, but evident and strongly discouraged any sort of imagination. They neglected Harry, verbally and emotionally abused him, and inflicted cruel punishments like depriving him of meals and locking him into the cupboard under the stairs on him whenever something \"unusual\" occurred. Their behaviour was left unreported to authorities. In his youth, Harry could make strange things happen without understanding why he could, as no one had told him that he was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. For instance, after Petunia had sheared off all of his messy hair using a pair of kitchen scissors in her fury that it would not lay flat, leaving him almost completely bald with only the fringe at the front, it had grown all the way back, and to its previous messy state at that, by the next morning. Harry was punished, even though he had not done anything on purpose. Another time, [[Dedalus Diggle]] bowed to him in a shop, and Petunia furiously interrogated Harry as to know how he knew the man before leaving the shop hastily.<ref name=\"PS2\" />\n\n[[File:Cupboard under the stairs GIF..gif|250px|thumb|left|Harry living in a cupboard beneath the staircase]]\nThe Dursleys spoiled and pampered their son [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] and paid almost no attention to Harry; indeed, what little attention they did pay to him was negative in its entirety. All his clothes were hand-me-downs from Dudley and were far too large for Harry. He was made to sleep in the [[Cupboard Under the Stairs]], while his cousin got two bedrooms to himself (one for sleeping in and one for storing all his toys). They also made Harry do household chores for them, such as making food and getting the post. In time, Dudley started bullying Harry. The Dursleys took Dudley and his friend [[Piers Polkiss]] to someplace spectacular every year for his birthday, but the only thing Harry ever got for his birthday was one of Vernon's old socks or a coat hanger.\n\nThe Dursleys always hid evidence of Harry's existence by not having pictures of him in the house. Among the few people who did know about Harry were Petunia's friend [[Yvonne]] and Vernon's sister [[Marjorie Dursley|Marge]], the latter of whom the boy was forced to consider an aunt to him despite not being a relative of his. Aunt Marge showed the most dislike for the frail boy while visiting [[Privet Drive]] during [[Dudley Dursley's fifth birthday]], when she whacked Harry around the shins to stop him from beating Dudley at [[musical statues]], and on holidays like Christmas, when she brought a computerised robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry to apparently eat.<ref name=\"PS2\" /> She eventually made a fool out of the young Potter during Dudley's tenth birthday, when Harry accidentally stepped on the paw of her favourite pet bulldog [[Ripper]], causing the enraged dog to chase him out into the garden and up a tree. [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] laughed himself silly at the sight of his cousin then, and to the Dursleys' delight, Marge refused to call Ripper off until past midnight.<ref name=\"PS2\" />\n\n[[File:Harry privet drive.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry with his aunt in the kitchen of 4 Privet Drive]]\nHarry's hardship, however, was highly necessary as by returning to live with his mother's only living blood relative, the [[Sacrificial protection|protection that Lily gave Harry]] would continue. While Harry could call that place home he could not be harmed. However, the [[Bond of blood charm]] would be broken when Harry turned seventeen years old, or when he no longer called [[4 Privet Drive]] his home.\n\nUnknown to Harry, one of his neighbours, [[Arabella Figg]], was a [[Squib]]. Unfortunately for Harry, to maintain favour with the Dursleys, she was forced by [[Albus Dumbledore]] to give him a lousy time whenever she had to look after him, as the Dursleys would never have let him go if they knew Harry was enjoying himself, a possibility that infuriated them. Harry discovered her connection to the wizarding world when it was revealed during the summer before his fifth year that she worked undercover for the [[Order of the Phoenix]] to keep tabs on Harry's suffering.\n\n[[File:HarryParseltongue.png|250px|thumb|left|Potter speaking [[Parseltongue]] to a boa constrictor at the zoo]]\nOn [[23 June]] [[1991]], Dudley's eleventh birthday, the Dursleys went to the [[zoo]] with Dudley and Piers. Unfortunately for the Dursleys, they had to take Harry with them, as Mrs Figg had broken her leg and there was no one to take Harry, and they refused to leave him alone in their house. At the zoo, Harry [[Parseltongue|spoke]] with a [[Boa constrictor at the Zoo|boa constrictor]] and unintentionally made the glass of its enclosure [[Vanishment|disappear]]. This allowed the snake to slither out of his cage which scared Dudley into thinking it was after him. Harry was able to communicate in Parseltongue with the freed boa, which thanked Harry briefly, then slithered out of the reptile house calmly.<ref name=\"PS2\" /> After this incident, the enraged [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] sentenced Harry to his cupboard until the beginning of the summer holidays.<ref name=\"PS3\">{{PS|B|3}}</ref>\n\n====St. Grogory's Primary School====\n{{Quote|At school, Harry had no one.

He had no friends there, since all the students were afraid of Dudley's tough friends, who hated Harry simply because Dudley did. Dudley and his friends liked to play a unique game \u2014 '[[Harry Hunting]]' \u2014 which involved chasing Harry for hours on end. Although Harry was good at sports, he was always the last picked for a team because no one wanted to admit to Dudley that they liked him, rather than because he was no good.\n\nHarry got decent, if not good grades at school. On one occasion, Harry accidentally [[Colour Change Charm|turned his teacher's wig blue]]; on another, he accidentally [[Apparition|apparated]] onto the school kitchen roof when escaping from Dudley's gang; and on a third, he made Dudley's old jumper shrink as [[Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]] tried to shove it over his head. These incidents always enraged the Dursleys, and after each, they would punish Harry by throwing him into the cupboard \u2014 except for after the jumper incident because Aunt Petunia thought that the jumper had shrunk in the wash.\n\nIf Harry had not gone to Hogwarts, then he would have attended [[Stonewall High]], a Muggle secondary school that Harry dreaded attending.<ref>Rowling never specified the environment within it, but it was presumably even worse than St. Grogory's in terms of what he might have expected as treatment.</ref>\n\n====Discovery of being a wizard====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Hagrid|Harry - yer a wizard.|Harry|I'm a what?|A wizard, o' course, an' a thumpin' good'un, I'd say once yeh've been trained up a bit.

On the week of Harry's birthday, hundreds of [[Hogwarts acceptance letter|letter]]s began arriving at the Dursleys' home, addressed to him from a place called [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. When the Dursleys saw the first letter was addressed as \"''cupboard under the stairs''\", they panicked at the thought of Harry's ill treatment being observed and transferred him to Dudley's second bedroom out of fear of being arrested for child abuse, which soon appeared on letters as the [[Smallest Bedroom|''smallest bedroom.'']]\n\nWhen [[Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]] first read the letter, he turned a pale porridge grey out of fear that wizards were trying to contact Harry. Because of this, Vernon tried to destroy the letters in a futile attempt to keep Harry from his destiny. But the letters kept coming in increasingly larger quantities, to the point where they started flying out of the fireplace by the dozens, and as they did, the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] saw no alternative, but to flee from them. This was not enough to let the Dursleys avoid the letters, as the owls carrying these letters followed them wherever they went. On [[30 July]] [[1991]], In a final desperate move on, the Dursleys moved to a [[Hut-on-the-Rock|shack]] on a rocky island at the edge of the sea.<ref name=\"PS3\" />\n\n[[File:Harry birthday.gif|250px|thumb|Potter receiving a birthday cake from [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] on his eleventh birthday]]\nAt midnight on [[31 July|Harry's birthday]], [[Rubeus Hagrid]] appeared in person to find out why Harry had not received his letter. He was infuriated by the Dursleys and explained to Harry, in spite of Vernon's obstinate protests, that he was a wizard, [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)|how his parents died]], that [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] demanded him to take Harry from the ruined house to his hated relatives, and that he was to be sent to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<ref name=\"PS4\" />\n\nThis would be Harry's first birthday celebration and Hagrid gave him [[Harry Potter's birthday cake from Rubeus Hagrid|a small homemade birthday cake]] and later, a snowy owl. Harry named her [[Hedwig]], a name he had found from his textbook (History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot). This was the first birthday present Harry ever received. Hagrid took Harry to the [[Leaky Cauldron]], where he learned that he was famous. He met [[Quirinus Quirrell]], his soon-to-be [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher at Hogwarts, the Inn-keeper [[Tom]], a witch named [[Doris Crockford]], and [[Dedalus Diggle]] \u2014 the man who had bowed to Harry several years earlier. Hagrid then took Harry to [[Diagon Alley]], where he learned more about his fame in the [[wizarding world]] and that his parents had left him a small fortune in a [[Vault 687|vault]] at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]].\n\n[[File:00Wand_shopPM.png|250px|thumb|left|Potter at Ollivander's on Diagon Alley buying [[Harry Potter's wand|his wand]]]]\nHarry bought [[Harry Potter's wand|his first wand]] from Ollivander's that very day. The wand that chose Harry was made of holly wood and had a [[phoenix feather]] core; it was 11\", nice and supple. The phoenix feather at its core came from Dumbledore's phoenix [[Fawkes]]. It was crafted by Garrick Ollivander, who had also created [[Tom Riddle's wand|a twin wand]]. This wand had been made from [[yew]], and contained the only other feather supplied by [[Fawkes]]. This twin wand had long ago chosen [[Tom Riddle]] as its master. But Riddle, after he turned to evil and assumed the alias of Lord Voldemort, ended up using this wand to attack Harry and his parents. The two wands, sharing the same phoenix origin, had a [[Reverse Spell|unique connection]] which would prevent them from successfully duelling against each other in the years to come.\n\n===Hogwarts years {{C|1991\u20131997}}===\n====First year====\n{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|But why couldn\u2019t Quirrell touch me?|Albus Dumbledore|Your mother died to save you.

Vernon helped Harry wheel his things to the platforms and left laughing about how [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters]] hadn't been built yet. The family then drove off leaving Harry at the busy station all alone. With only ten minutes left until the train's departure at eleven a.m., Harry was panicking when he overheard a red-headed family complaining about the station being packed with Muggles and he noticed they had an owl with their belongings.\n\n[[File:Harry meeting the Weasleys..jpg|250px|thumb|Harry meeting the Weasleys for the first time at [[King's Cross Station]]]]\nHarry watched as the older boys magically passed through the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Harry nervously interrupted them and was introduced to the youngest son [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], who was starting his first year as well. Molly (Ron's mother) kindly gave him instructions on how to board the platform. Harry quickly ran through the barrier, followed by Ron, and arrived on the Platform, catching his first sight of the [[Hogwarts Express]]. As most of the compartments were full, Harry pushed his things to near the end of the train, and with some help from twins from the red-headed family, was able to get his things aboard.<ref name=\"PS6\">{{PS|B|6}}</ref>\n\nWhile helping, the twins noticed his scar and recognised that he must be Harry Potter. While Harry sat near the window in his compartment watching the family, the twins [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] reported this discovery to the amazement of their little sister [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] and their older brother [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] who was a [[Prefect]] and had already changed into his robes. After boarding, the train soon departed and Ron asked if he could sit with Harry, who agreed. Ron asked Harry about his scar, and Harry asked if Ron's [[Weasley family|whole family]] were wizards, which they are except for his mother\u2019s [[Molly Weasley's second cousin|second cousin]], who was an accountant. When the [[Trolley witch]] came by around half-past twelve, Harry bought some of all the treats from the cart and shared them with Ron.\n\n[[File:Trio_meet.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The trio meeting for the first time aboard the [[Hogwarts Express]]]]\n[[Neville Longbottom]] soon came by searching for his lost [[toad]], [[Trevor]]. While Ron was attempting a [[Spell to turn Scabbers yellow|magic spell]] to change his rat [[Peter Pettigrew#Scabbers|Scabbers]], [[Hermione Granger]] interrupted trying to help find Trevor. After Ron's spell failed, Hermione introduced herself and upon learning Harry's name, informed him that he was in several books on magical history. While speculating which house they might be in, Harry and Ron were interrupted by [[Draco Malfoy]], [[Vincent Crabbe]], and [[Gregory Goyle]]. Although Draco attempted to ingratiate himself, Harry refused to shake his hand after he insulted Ron and his family. When Goyle attempted to take some of their [[Chocolate Frog Card]]s, Scabbers bit his finger and helped drive them off. Ron afterwards explained that the [[Malfoy family]] were on Voldemort's side, but came back saying they had been bewitched, although [[Arthur Weasley|his father]] didn't believe it.<ref name=\"PS6\" />\n\nUpon arriving, Hagrid gathered all the first years together and they followed a path down to the edge of a [[Great Lake]]. In groups of no more than four, they climbed aboard a little fleet of small boats, and sailed across the lake to an underground harbour. Helping to remind Neville to take his toad, Hagrid took them up a passageway to the gates of the castle.<ref name=\"PS6\" />\n\n=====The Sorting ceremony=====\n{{Quote|It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.|Harry's choice to be Sorted into Gryffindor|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\nThe new students were greeted at the castle door by [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor Minerva McGonagall]], who explained the four houses of Hogwarts: [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]], [[Ravenclaw]], and [[Slytherin]], as well as the [[Forum:House Cup Competition rules|rules of the]] [[House Cup]]. McGonagall led the first years into a [[Chamber of Reception|small room]] off the [[Entrance Hall]] and told them to wait until she returned. When she did, they were led into the [[Great Hall]], where they were greeted by the rest of the students, and more importantly, a [[Sorting Hat|shabby wizard's hat]] on a [[Sorting ceremony stool|small stool]].\n\n[[File:Harry Potter being sorted PSF.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry during the Sorting Ceremony]]\nHarry was particularly anxious, as he did not feel that any of the Houses as they were described in the Hat's song were right for him. Harry noted that [[Draco Malfoy]], whom Harry had met in [[Diagon Alley]], was instantly placed in Slytherin, and remembered what [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] had told him about Slytherin's reputation for turning out [[Dark Wizard]]s, and that [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] had been in Slytherin. When Harry put on the Hat, it slipped down past his eyes, and the hat told him that he \"would do well in Slytherin\". Thinking of Voldemort, Harry desperately repeated the phrase \"not Slytherin\". The Hat heeded Harry's request and placed Harry in Gryffindor along with Ron and [[Hermione Granger]]. In his second year during a visit to Dumbledore's office, the Sorting Hat re-emphasised the idea that Harry \"would do well in Slytherin\".\n\nThe Sorting Ceremony was followed by the [[Welcoming Feast]]. Harry, who had never been allowed to eat as much as he wanted, was overwhelmed by the sheer variety of foods in front of him. Dessert arrived, and talk turned to the first years' families. [[Neville Longbottom]] told the others how his family thought he was a [[Squib]] until his [[Algie Longbottom|Great-Uncle]] accidentally dropped him out of a window, and he bounced.\n\n[[File:HP1-1294.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry as his scar begins to hurt during the Sorting ceremony after making eye contact with [[Severus Snape]]]]\nIt was during the Feast that Harry's scar hurt for the first time: Harry was looking up at the staff table at [[Professor]] [[Quirinus Quirrell|Quirrell]] when the [[Severus Snape|hook-nosed teacher]] Quirrell was talking to looked past Quirrell at Harry, who immediately felt a sharp pain in his [[Harry Potter's scars#The lightning-bolt scar|scar]]. This is because Lord Voldemort was inhabiting Quirrell's body as anytime Voldemort is near Harry's scar hurt. After the last morsels melted from the golden plates and goblets, [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] gave a speech welcoming the new students to the school and the old students back. He added a few warnings about staying away from the [[Forbidden Forest]], and avoiding the [[Hogwarts Castle#Third Floor Corridor|third-floor corridor]] before leading the school in singing the [[Hoggy Warty Hogwarts|School Song]] and sending everyone off to their dormitories.\n\n=====First years lessons/classes=====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Severus Snape|What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?|Harry|I don't know.

Harry and Ron went down to Hagrid\u2019s hut for tea, where they met Hagrid's huge and fierce-looking dog, [[Fang]]. Hagrid told Harry that he was overreacting to Snape\u2019s treatment, asserting that he would have no reason to hate him. Hagrid and Ron began to talk about Ron's brother older [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]]. While they were talking, Harry picked up a cutting from the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' that was lying on the table. The article detailed a [[Break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank (1991)|break-in]] that occurred on Harry's birthday at Gringotts. The vault that was broken into was number 713, the same vault Hagrid visited with Harry on their trip to Diagon Alley.\n\n[[File:Flying class in 1991.jpg|250px|thumb|Hogwarts' first flying class of school year 1991-1992]]\nOne of the things Harry had been looking forward to was [[Flying (class)|learning to fly]] until he found out that the Gryffindors would be taking flying lessons with the Slytherins. Malfoy had been bragging about his skill to anyone who would listen. [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Rolanda Hooch]] taught the class by starting with basic broom control. After learning the theory, the students were told to hover gently off the ground on Madam Hooch's go-ahead. Neville, terrified of being left behind, panicked and kicked off before anyone else, rising fifty feet in the air before falling off and breaking his wrist. Madam Hooch took Neville to the [[Hospital Wing]] after warning the other students to stay on the ground until she got back.\n\nDraco Malfoy nicked Neville's [[Remembrall]] from off the ground and was told to give it to Harry, jeering that he'd leave it \"up a tree\" unless Harry stopped him and took off on his broom. Harry mounted his broom and kicked off after him. As much to his surprise as everyone else's, he discovered that he could not only fly, but that it was something he didn't need to be taught. Bending low on the broom handle, he shot toward Draco, who realised that Harry was a better flyer and threw the Remembrall into the air, daring the famous boy to catch it. Harry raced the ball towards the ground, catching it and coming out of his dive a foot from the ground. He toppled lightly onto the grass amidst the cheers of the Gryffindors, grinning wildly.\n\n[[File:Harry-potter1-seeker harry.jpg|250px|thumb|left|McGonagall discovering Harry's potential as the new Gryffindor Seeker]]\nHis euphoria did not last long however, as [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] quickly arrived on the scene. Having seen the dive, she ordered Harry to follow her. Harry, expecting punishment, was instead introduced to [[Oliver Wood]], whom she pulled out of a [[Charms (class)|Charms]] class. Captain of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], Wood's confusion at being introduced to a first year quickly turned to excitement and ecstasy upon hearing McGonagall recount the dive. He told her that Harry would need a decent broom if they were to compete, and explained to Harry that he would make an excellent [[Seeker]], perhaps rivalling the legendary [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]].\n\n=====The Midnight Duel=====\n{{Dialogue|Harry|You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you.|Draco Malfoy|I'd take you on anytime on my own.

Much calmer on the ground, and with his cronies [[Vincent Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle]] flanking him, Draco came over to taunt Harry about getting in trouble earlier. Enraged that Harry not only escaped trouble, but was instead rewarded, he challenged Harry to a wizard\u2019s duel. In spite of Hermione\u2019s attempt to dissuade them from breaking the school rules, (or perhaps because of it), Harry accepted the challenge.\n\n[[File:Trio third floor.jpg|250px|thumb|The trio trespassing in the restricted third-floor corridor]]\nAs they left the tower, the [[trio]] found Neville (whose wrist had been fixed by [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]]) waiting outside, having forgotten the password. Neville decided to go with them and the four arrived at the [[Trophy Room]] (the site of the duel), but Malfoy was nowhere to be found. They speculated that he may have chickened out and were deciding what to do next when they heard the school caretaker [[Argus Filch]] and his cat, [[Mrs Norris]], enter the room. Realising that Draco tricked them and told Filch their location, they attempted to quietly exit the room. A nearby doorknob rattled and [[Peeves]], Hogwarts' resident [[poltergeist]], burst into the hallway, threatening to expose them.<ref>{{PS|B|9}} - ''\"They hadn't gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of the classroom in front of them.

The four kids ran right to the end of the corridor, where they found themselves stopped by a locked door, which [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] opened with the [[Unlocking Charm]] using Harry's wand. They hurried inside, thinking themselves out of danger until turning around and coming face-to-face with a monstrous sight: [[Fluffy|a giant three-headed dog]]. Choosing Filch over death, the children ran for it, somehow managing to get back to their dormitory without running into anyone along the way. Though shaken by the night\u2019s events, Harry\u2019s interest in exploring was piqued by Hermione\u2019s pointing out that the dog was standing on a trapdoor.\n\n=====The Nimbus 2000=====\n{{Quote|Wood \u2014 I've found you a Seeker.

Harry, who had received no mail apart from [[Rubeus Hagrid's letter to Harry Potter (1991)|Hagrid\u2019s letter]], was intrigued as everyone else by the long, oddly-shaped package in the mail that morning, and was even more surprised than the others when he discovered what was inside: a [[Nimbus 2000]], and with [[Minerva McGonagall's letter to Harry Potter (1991) I|a note from Professor McGonagall]] warning him not to open the package at the table and that he was to meet Wood that night for [[Quidditch]] practice. Taking the broom up to their dormitory, Harry and Ron were stopped by [[Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]], who seized the package and told Harry that first-year students are not allowed their own [[Broomstick|brooms]]. When [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] walked up to them, he tried to report Harry, but Flitwick, who had been told of Harry\u2019s special permission, just expressed admiration for Harry\u2019s talent.\n\n=====Hallowe'en=====\n{{Quote|But from that moment on, [[Hermione Granger]] became their friend.

Only Hermione succeeded; Ron, offended by her air of superiority, later made a nasty comment that she overheard. The comment was about her lack of friends, causing her to run off to lock herself in the girl's bathroom in tears and making him and Harry feel slightly guilty. When the two went down to the [[Hallowe'en feast]] later, their guilt was forgotten amidst the splendour of the decorations.\n\nPartway into the feast, Quirrell arrived to announce that there was a twelve-foot [[Mountain Troll]] in the dungeons before fainting where he stood. The [[prefect]]s led the students back to their dorms, but Harry realised that Hermione did not know about the troll and convinced Ron to help save her, since they were responsible. They sneaked off to the girl\u2019s bathroom to warn Hermione, locking the troll inside. However, they didn't realise their mistake until they heard Hermione's terrified scream emanate from the bathroom. A horrified Harry and Ron ran back into the bathroom to rescue her. After a brief skirmish, during which Harry stuck his wand up the trolls nose. Ron finally knocked the troll out, by levitating the troll's own club to smash into it' head.\n\n[[File:B1C10M3 Troll in First-Floor Girls' Toilets.jpg|250px|thumb|The mountain [[troll]] in the bathroom, where Hermione is hiding]]\nThe teachers arrived, attracted by the troll\u2019s yells, to find Harry, Ron, and Hermione covered in dust, and the bathroom in disarray. [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], head of [[Gryffindor]], began scolding the boys for not going straight to their dormitories with the rest of their house, but instead putting themselves in grave danger. Much to Harry and Ron\u2019s surprise, Hermione lied to McGonagall and told her that she had gone looking for the troll, as she thought she could handle them. She claimed that Harry and Ron were looking for her, (which was true), and she would most likely be dead if the boys had failed to rescue her (also true). The three bonded over the shared experience, and were friends thereafter.\n\n=====Quidditch=====\n{{Dialogue|Harry|I've got the Snitch!|Marcus Flint|He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it!|Harry catches the Golden Snitch with his mouth|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}As the [[Quidditch]] season began Harry became increasingly nervous. The first match of the season was against [[Slytherin]]. Harry was under increasing pressure to show that he was not just a famous name. In an attempt to calm his nerves, Harry borrowed a book entitled {{QTA}}. A book that was comprehensive history of the sport, that Hermione most have checked put from the library. During break the day before the match, [[Trio|Harry, Ron, and Hermione]] were huddled together around a [[Bluebell Flames|jar of flames]], which had been conjured by Hermione, to keep warm.\n\n[[File:Harry-potter1-snape limp.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry notices the blood on Snape's robes and a slight limp when he walks]]\n[[Severus Snape|Snape]] noticed their guilty faces, and looking for a reason to punish them, confiscated Harry\u2019s book on the feeble pretext that library books were not be taken outside. Harry noticed that Snape was limping, as though his leg was injured, strengthening his suspicions that the [[Potions Master]] was after whatever it was that Fluffy was guarding. Nervous about the next day's match, Harry decided to ask Snape for the book back; realising that he would most likely be in the [[staffroom]] and that it would be harder for Snape to bully him if there were other teachers around, Harry decided to confront him. Approaching the door, Harry overheard Snape complaining to [[Argus Filch|Filch]] about Fluffy. After opening the door Harry saw Filch helping Snape to bandage his leg. He returned to the Common Room and then told his two friends everything he had seen.\n\n{{Main|Gryffindor vs Slytherin Quidditch match (1991)}}\n[[File:B1C11M2 Gryffindor vs Slytherin Quidditch match.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry playing in his first Quidditch match against Slytherin]]\nHarry had little time to dwell on Snape's injury as the first [[Quidditch]] match began the very next morning. Harry's job as being the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|Gryffindor]] [[Seeker]] was to catch the [[Golden Snitch]]. The snitch is a walnut-sized gold ball, that is extremely fast and difficult to see. The entire match rested upon the retrieval of the Snitch. Harry\u2019s first attempt to catch the Snitch was foiled when the [[Slytherin]] [[Seeker]] [[Blatching|blatched]] him. Though the Seeker was penalised, the move succeeded in stopping Harry from getting to the Snitch.  \n\nSoon after, Harry\u2019s broom began bucking uncontrollably as if trying to unseat him. The bucking became even more violent with each passing second, until Harry was hanging from the broom with just one hand. The crowd looked on with horror, some of the professors had their wands at the ready should he fall. Ron and Hermione began to wonder if the other was at fault. That is until [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], who had arrived to watch the game, noted that it would take [[Dark Arts|powerful dark magic]] to make a [[broomstick]] so hard to manage. Magic that powerful is well above the level of a second year and therefore had to be cases by a qualified wizard. This announcement did nothing to help the worried friends. \n\n[[File:Harry catches the snitch.gif|250px|thumb|left|Harry catches the Snitch and wins the opening match against Slytherin]]\n[[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], who had turned her gaze away from Harry, and was scanning the stands, noticed that [[Severus Snape|Snape]] was staring unblinkingly at Harry and muttering non-stop under his breath. Thinking quickly, Hermione took advantage of the fact that everyone\u2019s attention was now focused on Harry (and the Weasley twins\u2019 attempts to rescue him) to run around the entire [[Quidditch pitch|stadium]], knocking over [[Quirinus Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]], and ending up behind Snape. Muttering a few \"well-chosen words\" Hermione lit Snape\u2019s robes on fire with [[Bluebell Flames]]; a yell of shock told her she had done her job and she scooped the fire into a jar. Suddenly, up in the air, the spell on Harry\u2019s broomstick was broken and he was once again able to control his broom. The spectators watched in confusion as Harry dove towards the ground, only to clasp his hand to his mouth as if he was being violently sick the instant he landed. In actuality Harry had caught the Snitch in his mouth. His capture of the Snitch ended the match, thus Gryffindor won.\n\n[[File:B1C14M1 Trio in the Hogwarts Library.jpg|250px|thumb|The trio searching for information on Flamel in the [[Hogwarts Library]]]]\nAfter the match, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] took [[Trio|the three]] back to his [[Hagrid's Hut|hut]]. Ron and Hermione told Harry and Hagrid about what was happening on the other side of the stands, and how [[Severus Snape|Snape]] was [[Curse|cursing]] his [[broomstick]]. Hagrid, however, did not believe them, asking why Snape would try to kill Harry; Harry told Hagrid about Snape being bitten by [[Fluffy|the dog in the third-floor corridor]]. Hagrid, surprised by their knowledge, involuntarily revealed that the dog belonged to him, and that what the dog was guarding did not concern them, as it was a secret known only to [[Albus Dumbledore]] and a man named [[Nicolas Flamel]].\n\n=====Christmas season=====\n{{Quote|It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.|Albus Dumbledore warning Harry about the Mirror|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}\nImpressed as they were with the fact that Harry had managed to hold onto a [[Hurling Hex|bucking]] broomstick, Malfoy soon found that the rest of the school no longer found his taunts that Harry was to be replaced amusing, and so reverted to teasing Harry about having to stay at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] for the holidays. Harry, however, was looking forward to spending Christmas away from the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]], especially in light of the fact that Ron was also staying at Hogwarts, but also because it would give them some time to look up [[Nicolas Flamel]]; they were certain that [[Irma Pince|the librarian]] would be able to find a book on Flamel in an instant, but were worried that it might be suspicious, and were thus forced to search for themselves.\n\n[[File:Invisibility Cloak GIF.gif|250px|thumb|left|Harry receives his father's [[Cloak of Invisibility]] as a Christmas gift]]\nOn [[Christmas]] day, Harry and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] awoke to a pile of presents each at the foot of their beds. At the bottom of the pile, he found a package containing an Invisibility Cloak and an anonymous note telling him only that the cloak once belonged to [[James Potter I|his father]], and to \"use it well\". That night Harry, thoughts on the Cloak and decided to try it out. Realising he could go anywhere, he snuck back to the library and headed straight for the [[Restricted Section]]. Knowing he had to start somewhere, Harry pulled down one of the heavier books, and let it fall open on his knee. To his shock and horror, the silence was rent by a blood-curdling scream that issued from the book in front of him. He stuffed the book back in its place and ran for the door, knocking over the lantern he brought with him in his haste. Ducking under [[Argus Filch|Filch]]\u2019s outstretched arms, Harry ran down the dark corridors, away from the [[Hogwarts Library|library]], and away from Filch.\n\nThinking he had escaped, Harry was scared to hear Filch\u2019s voice approaching, and horrified when he realised whom Filch was talking to: [[Severus Snape|Snape]]. As Snape and Filch rounded the corner, Harry realised that although his father\u2019s cloak made him invisible, it did not stop him from being solid, and that he had no chance of sneaking past them, as the corridor was particularly narrow. Thinking quickly, (and panicking slightly), Harry noticed a door to his left; slipping inside, he found himself in an abandoned classroom. After Filch and Snape passed his hiding place, Harry relaxed and took in more details about the room he was in.\n\n[[File:MirrorOfErised PM.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry standing in front of the [[Mirror of Erised]]]]\nIn doing so, he noticed something he had missed the first time: an old, [[Mirror of Erised|gilded mirror]] bearing the inscription \u201c''Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi''\u201d. Stepping in front of the mirror, Harry very nearly cried out in shock: inside the mirror he saw a large crowd of people standing behind him. Shocked, Harry turned around to look at the room, but saw no one there. Turning back to the mirror and looking more closely, Harry realised that the man and woman in the front looked oddly like him. The man looked just like him, from his untidy hair to his glasses, and the [[Lily J. Potter|woman]], Harry saw, had the same eyes he had. Understanding, Harry focused on other members of the crowd, and saw others who had his untidy hair, his eyes, and even an old man who had Harry\u2019s knees; Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.\n\nThe next night, Harry brought Ron with him to the mirror room. Ron did not see Harry\u2019s family in the mirror, but instead saw himself standing alone, tall, holding the [[House Cup]], wearing badges indicating he was [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]] and [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Quidditch Captain]]. The two began arguing over who would be allowed to look in the mirror; [[Mrs Norris]], Filch\u2019s prowling cat, entered the room, attracted by the sounds of their argument. The next day, Ron, worried about being caught and about his friend\u2019s obsession with the mirror, warned Harry not to return; Harry, however, was not to be dissuaded.  \n\n[[File:Dumbledore talking to Harry about the Mirror of Erised.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Dumbledore advising Harry from seeking out the mirror again]]\nGoing to the [[Disused classroom|room]] that evening, Harry was ready to stay there all night, staring at the family he lost. However, in his haste, he failed to notice [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] standing by the door until after he removed his cloak. Dumbledore, who had been waiting for Harry, explained that the mirror, which was known as the \u201cMirror of Erised\u201d, displayed the deepest, most desperate desire of whoever looked into it. Harry, who had never known his family, saw them standing around him; Ron, ever overshadowed by his older brothers, saw himself standing alone, the best of them all.  \n\nBefore sending Harry back to bed, however, Dumbledore warned him that the mirror was and a dangerous object; men had been driven mad by what they saw in the mirror, not knowing if what they saw was real, or even possible. He told Harry that the mirror was to be moved to a new location, and warned Harry to not go looking for it. Before he left, Harry asked the headmaster what he saw in the mirror. Much to his surprise, Dumbledore told Harry that he saw himself with a pair of woollen socks. Despite his promise to Dumbledore, Harry found it difficult to forget the image of his parents, until [[Oliver Wood|Wood]] told the team that Snape would be refereeing the next Quidditch match against [[Hufflepuff]]. \n\n[[File:Neville got a Leg-Locker Curse (1991).JPG|250px|thumb|Harry cheers Neville up after the latter was bullied by Draco Malfoy]]\nShortly before the match, [[Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]], ever eager to pick on [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]], used the [[Leg-Locker Curse]] on Neville, forcing him to bunny hop his way back to the [[Gryffindor Tower|Common Room]]. Harry told Neville he was \"worth twelve of Malfoy\" and gave him a [[Chocolate Frog]]. Thanking Harry, Neville handed the card back to Harry for his collection. Looking down, Harry noted it was Dumbledore's card, the first he ever got. He turned the card over and suddenly remembered where he read the name Nicolas Flamel before: on the [[Hogwarts Express|train on the way to school]].\n\nAs the [[Gryffindor]] vs. Hufflepuff Quidditch match drew nearer, tensions mounted in the school; Gryffindor had failed to overtake Slytherin in the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup]] for seven years, and Harry was worried that it would be impossible with Snape as a referee. Unknown to Harry, Ron and Hermione had been practising the Leg-Locker Curse to use on Snape, should he show any signs of wanting to harm Harry. Before the match began, Wood took Harry aside and reminded him that he needed to catch the [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]] as soon as he could, before Snape could favour Hufflepuff too much. Harry performed his role as [[Seeker]] phenomenally, catching the Snitch within five minutes of the game starting, putting Gryffindor in first place for the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]].\n\n=====Detention=====\n{{Dialogue|Firenze|It will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price.

When the trio arrived later, they noticed that the fire was lit, despite the heat of the day. Although he was reluctant to answer their questions, Hermione managed to manipulate him into talking about the various protections used to guard it: [[Fluffy]], the three headed dog, was Hagrid's, along with enchantments from Professors [[Pomona Sprout|Sprout]], [[Filius Flitwick|Flitwick]], [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]], [[Quirinus Quirrell|Quirrell]], and [[Severus Snape|Snape]]. Harry, growing uncomfortable in the heat, asked Hagrid to open a window, something Hagrid refused to do as he had a [[dragon egg]] in the fire. Unfortunately [[Draco Malfoy]] discovered the [[dragon]], and decided to use the knowledge to get revenge by getting them into trouble for possessing an illegal dragon. So Malfoy in turn, tried to tell McGonagall of the trio's activities.\n\n[[File:B1C14M3 Astronomy Tower farewell Norbert.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry and Hermione wait on top of the Astronomy tower with baby Norbert]]\nTo save everyone involved, Harry, Ron, and Hermione convinced Hagrid to send [[Norberta|Norbert]] off to Ron's brother [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]], who would take Norbert to a [[Romania]]n dragon preserve. While helping Hagrid to prepare Norbert for the journey, the dragon bit Ron's hand, causing it to swell up and forcing Ron to see [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]]. On the pre-arranged night, Harry and Hermione managed to smuggle Norbert in a crate up to the [[Astronomy Tower]] under Harry's [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility cloak]]. On the way up they witnessed Professor McGonagall hauling Malfoy away for being out of bed at night, who protested that Harry was in possession of a dragon. Harry and Hermione passed the crate off to Charlie's friends and headed back down the stairs, where they were confronted by a gleeful [[Argus Filch]]; they had left the Cloak behind.\n\n[[File:WB F1 Fang HarryMalfoyFangInForest 11428.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry in the Dark Forest with Draco Malfoy during their detention]]\nFilch took them to McGonagall's office, where they found [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]], who had attempted to warn them about Malfoy. [[Minerva McGonagall]], who was very disappointed in them, took fifty points each from Harry, Hermione, and Neville and gave the three detention, which they were to serve along with [[Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]]. Harry's popularity, riding high on his Quidditch wins plummeted: no one wanted to talk to the \"stupid first year\" who, along with two others, had lost Gryffindor their chance of defeating [[Slytherin]], and winning the [[House Cup]]. A week or so before exams, Harry's new determination to not meddle in other's business was tested when he heard [[Quirinus Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]], whimpering as if he was being threatened. Believing that [[Severus Snape|Snape]] was the one threatening Quirrell, and that he was going after the Stone, Hermione suggested that they go talk to [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], but Harry dismissed the idea, as they had no proof.\n\nThe next morning, Harry, Hermione, and Neville received notes from Professor McGonagall informing them their detention would begin at eleven that night. [[Argus Filch]] took them out to the [[Forbidden Forest]], where [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] was waiting for them. Hagrid led them into the Forbidden Forest and showed them a pool of [[unicorn]] blood on the ground. They split up, Hagrid taking Harry and Hermione, while Neville and [[Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]] went off with [[Fang]]. After Malfoy scared Neville into sending up red sparks, Hagrid sent Harry off with Malfoy, deciding that Malfoy would be less likely to scare Harry. \n\n[[File:Harry Potter and Firenze in the Forbidden Forest.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry with Firenze in the forest discussing the properties of unicorn blood]]\nAs they continued, Harry noticed the pools of unicorn blood they were following seemed to be growing larger and larger, as if the animal had been thrashing around. Eventually, they came to a clearing and found the laying on the ground, and very dead. As they watched, a hooded figure emerged from the bushes and began to drink the unicorn's blood. Malfoy screamed and bolted away with [[Fang]], leaving Harry, half blinded by the pain in his scar to stumble away from the advancing figure. Harry was saved by [[Firenze]], a palamino [[centaur]], who allowed Harry to ride on his back out of the forest. Firenze told Harry the properties of [[unicorn blood]]. Harry realised that there would only be one person who would be so desperate as to kill a unicorn: [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]].\n\n=====The Philosopher's Stone=====\n{{Dialogue|Harry|\"Professor, I think \u2014 I know \u2014 that someone's going to try and steal the Stone.

They ran down to ask Hagrid more about the man who gave him Norbert, only to find out that the stranger never lowered his hood, something of a fashion in the [[Hog's Head Inn|Hogs head]]. Hagrid explained that he couldn't remember much, as the man kept buying him drinks, but said that he thought they talked about [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and the kinds of creatures Hagrid looks after there.\n\n[[File:Transfiguration homework.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The trio attempting to tell McGonagall about the plot to steal the [[Philosopher's Stone]]]]\nFocused on remembering what had happened that night, Hagrid accidentally let slip that [[Fluffy]] fell asleep when played music. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, now convinced that Snape had all the information he needed to get past Fluffy, decided to go see Professor Dumbledore and tell him their suspicions. While walking across the [[Entrance Hall]], they were stopped by Professor McGonagall, and decided to tell her what they'd found out. She insisted that no one could steal the Stone, and told them that Dumbledore was in London for the day.\n\n{{Main|Skirmish in the Underground Chambers}}\nAs the trio set off that night to stop Snape, they were stopped themselves by [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]], who believed they were sneaking out without reason again, and was worried that they would loose [[Gryffindor]] even more points. Desperate as they were for time, Hermione [[Full Body-Bind Curse|paralysed]] Neville. When they arrived the third-floor corridor, it was to find [[Fluffy]] awake, but a harp by his feet. Remembering what Hagrid told them, Harry began to blow into the wooden flute Hagrid gave him for [[Christmas]]. From the first notes, Fluffy's eyes began to droop, and he quickly fell asleep. Jumping through the trapdoor, they found themselves in Professor Sprout's room, filled with [[Devil's Snare]], which almost smothered them.\n\n[[File:Harry-Potter and the winged-keys PS.png|250px|thumb|Harry retrieves the right key from the swarm]]\nThe next room, Professor Flitwick's, held a bunch of [[Winged Keys|flying keys]] and some [[broomstick]]s. Harry found the correct key, caught it, and unlocked the next door with it. The next room was Professor McGonagall's, and had a large chessboard, for a game of [[Wizard's Chess]] which Ron won at the cost of sacrificing himself. Harry and Hermione continued to the next room (leaving an unconscious Ron where they could return for him), to find an unconscious [[troll]]; Professor Quirrell's room. Lastly, they entered Professor Snape's room, and found seven potions in bottles along with a roll of paper giving clues on which one to drink to continue: a logic puzzle. Hermione solved the puzzle, and at Harry's urging, drank the potion that allowed her to head back so that she could get Ron out, while Harry drank the potion to go forward to the final room.\n\n[[File:QuirinusQuirrell WB F1 QuirrellAndHarry Still 080615 Land.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Harry and Quirrell in the Dungeon]]\nOnce inside the room, Harry's attention was drawn to two things: the [[Mirror of Erised]], and [[Quirinus Quirrell|Quirrell]]. Quirrell bound Harry before explaining that the Mirror was the key to finding the Stone. Desperate to distract him from the Mirror, Harry questioned Quirrell, who revealed that was serving [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], and although Snape hated Harry (because Snape allegedly loathed his father in their time at school), he never wanted him dead. Unable to locate the stone, Quirrell asked Voldemort for help; much to Harry's surprise, a voice which seemed to issue from Quirrell himself said \"to use the boy\".\n\nLooking in the Mirror, Harry saw his reflection pull the Stone out of his pocket and replace it, at which point he felt the real Stone drop his real pocket. He told Quirrell that he saw himself winning the House Cup, but Voldemort, an accomplished [[Legilimency|Legilimens]], informed Quirrell that Harry was lying, and ordered Quirrell to allow him to speak \"to the boy\". Quirrell unwrapped his turban, and turned away from Harry. Voldemort, who was sticking out of the back of Quirrell's head, demanded that Harry give him the Stone. Harry refused, and Quirrell seized him, causing Harry's scar to sear with pain; but contact with Harry's skin burned Quirrell's hands, forcing him to release Harry. Harry, realising that contact caused Quirrell pain, grabbed Quirrell's arm and held on until he blacked out.\n\n[[File:B1C17M2 Harry's first Hospital Wing stay.png|250px|thumb|Harry in the [[Hospital Wing]] after the attack in the underground chamber]]\nHe woke in the [[Hospital Wing]], where Albus Dumbledore reassured him that Quirrell did not succeed at getting the Stone, and that the Stone had in fact, been destroyed. Dumbledore then explained the reason why Quirrell could not touch him was that because Harry's mother had died to save him, granting him [[Sacrificial protection|protection against Voldemort]].\n\nAt the [[End-of-Term Feast]], after seemingly congratulating Slytherin on winning the [[House Cup]], Dumbledore awarded Ron and Hermione fifty points, Harry sixty points, and Neville ten, which allowed them to win the cup.\n\n====Second year====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a-b-a-b-a|Ron Weasley|You're a Parselmouth.

Harry, this is bad.|Harry and Ron discussing Parseltongue|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\nHarry's second year in [[1992]] started out badly and gradually got worse. Throughout the preceding summer, the Dursleys became so fearful of his newly discovered magical abilities that they locked away all of his school supplies immediately after his return home to them. They even went as far as to ban him from saying words pertaining or related to magic in general, as evident to Harry getting reprimanded by [[Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]] for saying the word \"magic\" at the breakfast table one day. This, however, did not stop Harry from exploiting their paranoia in order to have quiet time alone, such as taunting [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] with made-up magical [[incantation]]s (like [[Jiggery Pokery]], [[Hocus Pocus]], and [[Squiggly wiggly]]) whenever the latter teased him. Furthermore, he had no contact with any of his friends nor any news from the wizarding world, and [[Hedwig]] took to making noise out of boredom from being padlocked in her cage.\n\n[[File:B2C1M2 Dursley's garden.png|250px|thumb|left|Harry in the garden at 4 Privet Drive]]\nOn [[31 July]] (Harry's [[Harry Potter's twelfth birthday|twelfth birthday]]), Harry felt very lonely from receiving no letters from his friends. Dudley taunted him stating \"''Who would want to be friends with you?''\" The Dursleys seemed to have forgotten his birthday too, for they were too busy preparing for a dinner party with [[Mason|a client]] of Vernon's at work. The sight of the hedge supposedly staring back startled Harry, but [[Dudley Dursley]] came over to bother him as the eyes vanished. Harry tried to scare his cousin away by pretending the use of incantations would set the hedge on fire. Petunia then threatened him with a soapy pan and tasked him with a list of chores to keep him out of her way until Vernon and Dudley returned home from buying dinner jackets.\n\n[[File:Dobby 1992.jpeg|250px|thumb|Dobby introduces himself to Harry]]\nWhen he was sent up to his bedroom later that evening for the dinner party, a [[house-elf]] named [[Dobby]] waiting on his bed to warn him against returning to Hogwarts. As it meant putting himself in great danger. He tried to tell Dobby that Hogwarts was his home and where he belonged. The elf then revealed that he prevented the direct deliverance of the mail from Harry's friends and promised to give the letters back when Harry complied with the warning.\n\nThis bargain failed as well, so Dobby crashed the dinner party downstairs via a [[Hover Charm]] on Petunia's homemade masterpiece of [[pudding]], which splattered everywhere when the spell was lifted, and disappeared. The mess left behind was thus blamed on Harry, who received an official warning from the [[Ministry of Magic]] about using magic outside school. The Dursleys taking advantage of this incident and using it as a means to suppress the magical blood in their nephew, locked him in his room with bars on his window to prevent him from returning to Hogwarts as punishment.\n\n[[File:Harry escaping privet drive.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Fred, George, and Ron rescue Harry from the Dursleys with the use of a [[Flying Ford Anglia]]]]\nThree nights later, Harry was rescued from his imprisonment by Ron, who was worried about not hearing from him all summer and flew with his older brothers [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] in a flying Ford Anglia belonging to their father [[Arthur Weasley]], the Head of the Ministry's [[Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office]], to break off the bars on Harry's window and help him retrieve his school things. Hedwig's screeches soon alerted the Dursleys of the getaway, but they were unable to do anything as the car flew off with Harry in tow. During the flight to the [[Weasley family]]'s home [[the Burrow]], Harry told Ron and the twins about Dobby's warning, which Fred and George concluded must have been part of a joke from [[Draco Malfoy]], whose [[Malfoy family|family]] was of great wealth.\n\nThey arrived at their destination early the next morning to find a worried-sick [[Molly Weasley]] waiting in the kitchen to punish her three sons for taking the vehicle without permission by having them and Harry (who volunteered) [[Gnome|de-gnome]] the garden. Mr Weasley came home to discuss the results of his proposed [[Muggle Protection Act]] to the Ministry with his family, and was glad to meet Harry once introduced to him despite his wife berating him for bewitching their car. As a generous measure, the Weasleys welcomed the young wizard into the family fold for the rest of the summer, though this made Ron's younger sister [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] spend the entire day hiding in Harry's presence.\n\n=====Welcoming at Flourish and Blotts=====\n{{Dialogue a-b-c|Ron Weasley|Where did you come out?|Harry|Knockturn Alley.|Weasley twins|Excellent!|Harry's Floo mishap lands him in Borgin and Burkes|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\n[[File:Harry-potter2-borgin_&_burkes.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry in [[Knockturn Alley]] inside Borgin and Burkes]]\nWhen a [[Hogwarts acceptance letter]] for Ginny arrived a week later, the Weasleys set out for [[Diagon Alley]] using the [[Floo Network]] eight days afterwards to buy some school supplies. Harry ended up at [[Borgin and Burkes]] in the adjacent Knockturn Alley. While inside the shop he was forced to hide in a [[Crushing Cabinet]], as Draco Malfoy and his father [[Lucius Malfoy]] entered. Draco made many sulky remarks regarding Harry's talent in [[Quidditch]].\n\nThe shopkeeper, [[Borgin|Mr Borgin]] was surprised that Mr Malfoy was only selling dark and illegally enchanted artefacts and not buying. Mr Malfoy was sealing the items before they could be confiscated by the raids on wizarding households Mr Weasley was conducting as part of the Muggle Protection Act, Borgin expressed pity to the current decline of [[Blood status|blood purity]]. Draco, on the other hand, interest in a few of the items already on sale, including the [[Hand of Glory]] and a [[Opal Necklace|cursed opal necklace]], and was stopped from approaching Harry's hiding place by his father.\n\n[[File:Harr Potter takes image with Lockhart.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Gilderoy Lockhart embarrasses Harry while in [[Flourish and Blotts]]]]\nSoon as the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]] left, Harry was found leaving the shop himself by [[Rubeus Hagrid]], who brought him out of Knockturn and into Diagon Ally's Flourish and Blotts, where the Weasleys were in line with Hermione and her parents for a book signing for the arrival of flamboyant but incompetent celebrity author [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], who was recently appointed Hogwarts' new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[professor]]. When Lockhart saw Harry for the first time, he got excited and beckoned him up to the front, allowing the audience to take pictures of them together before giving Harry a [[Gilderoy Lockhart's published works|set of his books]].\n\nHarry was too embarrassed by this publicity stunt, and gave the books to Ginny since he could afford a set of his own. Draco went over to congratulate him for being unable to avoid making the front page when walking into a bookstore, but then his father moved him aside to have a one-on-one argument with Mr Weasley over the latter's obsession with Muggles (finding an example of which in Hermione's parents, both Muggle dentists), provoking Weasley into lunging at him. Hagrid broke up the fight just in time, but not before the senior Malfoy slipped a [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|diary]] into Ginny's [[cauldron]] of school books.\n\n=====Car flight alongside the Hogwarts Express=====\n{{Quote|Brilliant! Inspired! What an entrance! Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow, people'll be talking about that one for years \u2014|The impressed inhabitants of [[Gryffindor Tower]]|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\n[[File:Blocked Barrier GIF.gif|250px|thumb|Harry and Ron Weasley crossing the magical barrier to Platform 9\u00be only to find it blocked]]\nWhen Harry and Ron tried to get onto [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters|Platform 9\u00be]] to join Hermione and the rest of the Weasleys, the barrier mysteriously sealed, and they hit the wall. They missed the [[Hogwarts Express]] as a result, and decided to fly the car to Hogwarts, reasoning that they would not be seen due to the [[Invisibility Booster]] that Mr Weasley installed. However, the booster failed shortly after takeoff, and the car was spotted by several Muggles as they flew northward alongside the train.\n\nTheir day-long flight ended with them crashing into the [[Whomping Willow]], instead of with the graceful landing they imagined. [[Charles Weasley's wand|Ron's wand]] was inadvertently broken by the resulting impact as the gigantic tree started pounding the car in anger of being hit, but luckily for them, the battered Angila broke free from the branches to eject Harry and Ron out of the front seat with their belongings before driving off into the [[Forbidden Forest]]. Both boys were found by [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] watching the [[Sorting ceremony]] from the window. They were taken to [[Severus Snape's office|his office]], where they were given separate [[Discipline at Hogwarts#Detention|detentions]] by [[Albus Dumbledore]] and professor [[Minerva McGonagall]]. Ginny Weasley, meanwhile, was sorted into Gryffindor.\n\n[[File:B2C7M2 Harry replying to Lockhart's fan mail.png|250px|thumb|left|Harry helping Lockhart answer fan-mail as detention, before he hears the voice inside the walls]]\nThe next day at breakfast, Ron received a [[Howler]] from his mother, who told him that he would be brought home if he broke another rule. The day only got worse when the Gryffindors attended their first Defence Against the Dark Arts class. Lockhart's teaching was a disaster, since the first thing he did was give them a pop quiz on himself and claimed the answers could be found in his books. He then let a cage of \"freshly caught\" Cornish [[Pixie]]s loose and struggled to round them up, but ran to hide from them leaving his young pupils to save the day.\n\nAs the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts|DADA]] lessons continued, Harry found himself having to act out scenes from Lockhart's books as he read them in class. Lockhart was in love with fame and kept bothering Harry, who had to help him answer his fan-mail while Ron had to polish the school's prizes and trophies. But he was not the only one who paid him extra attention: Many [[first year|first-year]] [[Gryffindor]]s like [[Colin Creevey]] were star-struck by Harry, and Ginny had a huge crush on him that developed over the summer since she first saw the famous Potter on Platform 9\u00be at the start and end of his first year. After hours of tedious work, Harry heard a disembodied, sinister voice, which Lockhart was unable to hear.\n\n=====Death-day Party=====\n{{Quote|The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the Heir Beware.|A grim message from the Heir of Slytherin|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\n[[File:Writting on the wall.jpg|250px|thumb|The writing on the wall and the petrified form of [[Mrs Norris]]]]\nIn return for distracting [[Argus Filch]] just when he was about to give Harry severe punishment for something he did not do, Harry promised he would attend [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly Headless Nick]]'s Death-day Party on [[Hallowe'en]]. He did this as a favour in order to help boost Nick's reputation, so that he might achieve his desire of joining the Headless Hunt. He brought Ron and Hermione along, as well. Hermione was excited at the prospect of attending the event, as most living beings have not been to a [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party|Death-day Party]]. Ron on the other hand was not excited at attending the event.\n\n[[File:Deathday Party Pottermore.png|250px|thumb|left|The trio attended Sir Nicolas's Death-day Party]]\nThe event was dismal and dreary. The party entailed a candlelit dinner of rancid, mouldy food, the smell of which caused all three to gag. Harry knew the reason for this was the claim that a ghost can \"almost taste\" seriously spoiled food. Sir Nicolas was deeply touched that the three students put in an appearance, in part because it gave him a certain status in the eyes of his fellow deceased. But the three of them quickly grew tired of the ghostly party and returned to the [[Great Hall]]. Before they got to the [[Hallowe'en feast]], Harry heard the voice (which Ron and Hermione also could not hear). He followed it to the second floor where he found the bathroom flooded and Mrs Norris, Filch's cat, [[Petrification|petrified]] \u2014 coupled with a message on the wall.\n\nFilch became distraught and threatened Harry, as he mistakenly believed Harry to be the culprit. [[Argus Filch|Filch]] and [[Severus Snape|Snape]] then tried to get Harry in trouble for this, but Dumbledore said that it was powerful [[Dark Arts|dark magic]] that no second year student could perform. They decided that [[Pomona Sprout|Sprout]]'s [[mandrake]]s would be used, once they were mature enough, to create a draught capable of reviving Mrs Norris. This occurrence left the students and staff with a sense of dread and worry, as many believed that the writing on the wall was just the beginning\n\n=====History of Magic=====\n{{Dialogue|Hermione Granger|I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets?|Cuthbert Binns|The story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew nothing. Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school. The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic.|The legend of the [[Chamber of Secrets]]|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\n[[File:Cuthbert Binns on the Chamber of Secrets.png|250px|thumb|[[Cuthbert Binns|Professor Binns]] tells his students the legend of the Chamber of Secrets]]\nHermione wanted to research the Chamber of Secrets, so she talked [[History of Magic]] Professor Cuthbert Binns into telling the class about its origin. To begin the story, Binns explained that it all started with the founding of Hogwarts itself around [[First millennium A.D.|990 A.D.]], at the hands of two of the greatest wizards and two of the greatest witches of the age: [[Godric Gryffindor]], [[Helga Hufflepuff]], [[Rowena Ravenclaw]], and [[Salazar Slytherin]]. But Slytherin got into an argument with the other founders about whether Muggle-borns should be admitted and, when the rift grew too large between him and Gryffindor, he left the school. According to legend, he built a going-away present to the school in the form of a secret chamber that could only be opened by his true heir. This \"Chamber of Secrets\" allegedly contained a [[Serpent of Slytherin|monster]] that, once released, would purge the school of all [[Muggle-born]]s. Professor Binns unsuccessfully tried to assure the class that the Chamber did not actually exist and that the school had been searched many times in vain.\n\nHarry, Ron and Hermione decided that the heir was probably [[Draco Malfoy]]. To try to prove it, Hermione proposed to use the [[Polyjuice Potion]], which can change one's appearance into somebody else's for an hour. Hermione warned that the potion would take a month to brew, supposing they gathered all the necessary ingredients (one of which could only be found in [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]'s private inventory) and managed to keep it a secret.\n\n=====Quidditch=====\n{{Dialogue|Harry|So there is a Chamber of Secrets? And did you say it's been opened before? Tell me, Dobby!|Dobby|Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor Dobby.

[[Draco Malfoy]] had been made Slytherin's new [[Seeker]], on the merit of his father's generous contribution to the team: a set of [[Nimbus 2001]] brooms. During the match one of the Bludgers took after Harry and focused completely on him. Malfoy lost no time in making fun of the manoeuvres Harry had to perform in order to avoid the Bludger. Since [[Bludger]]s were supposed to attack each and every player, the crowd soon realised that this Bludger had been tampered with. Harry still managed to catch the [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]] and <span style=\"font-weight:normal;\">Gryffindor won</span>. He caught it right out from under Malfoy's nose, who was more focused on taunting Harry then looking for the Snitch. However, the Bludger broke his arm and Lockhart in his attempt to fix it removed all of the bones instead. [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] gave Harry a potion called [[Skele-Gro]], to counter this and he was forced to stay in the [[Hospital Wing]] overnight.\n\n[[File:Harry-potter-and-dobby-gallery.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Dobby]] and Harry in the hospital wing, after Harry injured his right arm during a Quidditch match]]\nDuring that night, Dobby visited Harry and revealed that it was he who made the Bludger chase after Harry and was also responsible for the barrier of [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters|platform 9\u00be]] not letting him in. Dobby did this in hopes of Harry leaving or never arriving at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. This was a misguided attempt to protect Harry from the monter inside the chamber. Dobby proceeded to ask Harry to leave the school, something he refused to do. He also revealed that the [[Chamber of Secrets]] had been opened before and immediately punished himself, as he was not supposed to reveal anything. After Dobby disappeared, Dumbledore, [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]], and Madam Pomfrey entered with [[Colin Creevey]], who had apparently been petrified. He was found with a camera containing film that had been burnt to the melting point.\n\n=====Duelling Club=====\n{{Dialogue|Draco Malfoy|Scared Potter?|Harry|You wish!|Harry prepares to enter a practice duel with Malfoy|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\n[[File:Duel harry draco.gif|250px|thumb|left|Meeting of the Duelling club, where Harry and Draco participate in a practice duel]]\nHarry signed up for a [[Duelling Club]], which was (to Harry's great displeasure) taught by his two least favourite teachers: [[Gilderoy Lockhart|Lockhart]] and [[Severus Snape|Snape]]. The event was scheduled to take place in the Great Hall. During the club's first meeting Lockhart demonstrated an ineptitude. He was successfully disarmed by Snape and floundered throughout the entire practice duel. Also during a practice battle in the first meeting, [[Draco Malfoy]] conjured a snake to attack Harry. Malfoy conjured this snake via instructions from Snape. Lockhart tried to banish it, but all he managed was to set it loose on the students.\n\nHarry saw that the snake was rapidly advancing on a Muggle-born student and [[Hufflepuff]] named [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]] (who had introduced himself to Harry before this incident) and instinctively told it to stop, which \u2014 to Harry's great surprise \u2014 it did. The others students were less than ecstatic about this development, however. All they saw was Harry speaking [[Parseltongue]], the language of snakes and became afraid. Since they could not understand it, it seemed to them that he was egging the snake on. It turned out that Parseltongue was a very rare gift that was closely associated with [[Salazar Slytherin]]. This was something Slytherin was famous for, hence why the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent. Due to this, Harry became the number one suspect among students for being the heir of Slytherin. Hermione even told him that since Salazar Slytherin lived so long ago, he might actually be.\n\n[[File:Chamber-of-secrets-fawkes.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry meets [[Fawkes]] for the first time after finding a petrified Justin]]\nSeconds after leaving a conversation with [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], Harry ran into a petrified Justin Finch-Fletchley and a black, smoking [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly-Headless Nick]]. [[Peeves]] alerted the whole school, and a Hufflepuff called [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]] claimed that Harry had been caught red-handed. For the first time, Harry was taken to [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s office, and there he witnessed Fawkes \u2014 Dumbledore's [[phoenix]] \u2014 bursting into ashes and being reborn. Dumbledore says that he did not believe Harry to be behind the attacks, a belief reinforced by Hagrid backing Harry's alibi, but a large portion of the school was sure that Harry was [[Salazar Slytherin|Slytherin]]'s heir.\n\n=====Disguised as Slytherins=====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Hermione Granger|There might be a way.

This gave them the perfect opportunity to use their Polyjuice potion. When Christmas arrived they drugged Crabbe and Goyle via [[chocolate cake]]s, took their hairs and assumed their forms. Hermione tried to use a hair she thought belonged to [[Millicent Bulstrode]], but it was actually her cat's and Hermione was transformed into a hybrid. Hermione was forced to spend a few weeks in the [[Hospital Wing]]. As Crabbe and Goyle, Harry and Ron interrogated an unsuspecting [[Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]] and discovered that Draco was not the Heir of [[Slytherin]]. They also heard that the last time the chamber was opened, a [[Muggle-born]] girl died and whoever was responsible was expelled. Malfoy also mentioned his father's secret stash of illegal artefacts.\n\n[[File:Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-2002-books-male-characters-29996396-500-375.jpg|250px|thumb|The trio discuss possible theories behind Tom Riddle's mysterious [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|diary]]]]\nWeeks later, Ron and Harry overheard [[Argus Filch]] complaining about his workload and leaving. They arrive at [[Myrtle Warren]]'s bathroom to find it flooded. Myrtle, a sulking [[ghost]], explained that she had flooded it because somebody threw a diary at her. Harry picked it up; it turned out to have belonged to a T.M. Riddle and appeared to be completely blank. Ron remembered from his detention that [[Tom Riddle|Riddle]] had won an award for special service to the school fifty years before. Hermione deduced that since this coincided with the last time the [[Chamber of Secrets|Chamber]] was opened, Tom Riddle might have received his prize for catching whoever was responsible for the attacks back then. Even though all attempts to extract information from the diary failed, Harry felt a strange compulsion to keep it.\n\nOn [[Valentine's Day]], Ron and Harry were dismayed to find out Lockhart had spread dwarves dressed as cupids throughout the school to receive and deliver Valentines. One cupid-dwarf managed to deliver one to Harry. While struggling to avoid him, the embarrassed Harry tripped and fell, spilling ink all over the contents of his bag. Ginny noticed the diary and assumed a horrified expression.\n\n=====The Secret Diary=====\n{{Quote|Harry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the cover told him it was fifty years old.

He tried writing to the diary and, to his surprise, the diary \u2014 or rather T.M. Riddle \u2014 began to write back. Riddle explained that he was the one who caught the person who opened the [[Chamber of Secrets]] the last time, and he could show Harry what happened. Harry agreed and got sucked into a \"recording\" of Riddle's memory.\n\nHarry witnessed the school's previous headmaster, [[Armando Dippet]], informing Riddle that the school would be closed and Riddle, apprehensive of this, catching [[Rubeus Hagrid]] fiddling with a large spider in a box. Riddle reported Hagrid to Dippet. During the memory, Harry also learned that Riddle was an orphan that did not want to go back to the orphanage, and his full name was [[Tom Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]]. Having seen this, Harry wondered whether Hagrid was the one who opened the Chamber fifty years before and whether he was responsible this time. This was exactly what Riddle wanted.\n\n[[File:Harry-potter2-movie-dorm.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry possessions are ransacked by a fellow Gryffindor in search of Tom Riddle's diary]]\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione decided not to ask Hagrid about it, hoping that the attacks had stopped \u2014 and indeed, almost four months after the attack on [[Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin]] and [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly-Headless Nick]], the disembodied voice kept quiet and the attacks seemed to have ceased. However, odd things keep happening: Harry returned to his dormitory one day to find it a mess. Ron deduced that somebody had been looking for something, and Harry eventually noticed that [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|Tom Riddle's diary]] was gone. This greatly befuddled them, seeing as only a [[Gryffindor]] could know the password to enter the [[Gryffindor Tower|dormitory]].\n\n=====[[Cornelius Fudge]]=====\n{{Dialogue a-b|Hagrid|If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they\u2019d have ter do would be ter follow the spiders.

This time, [[Minerva McGonagall]] called for Harry and Ron personally, and led them to the [[Hospital Wing]], where they saw Hermione petrified. She was found near the [[Hogwarts Library|library]] with a [[Ravenclaw]] [[prefect]], inexplicably holding a small, circular mirror. This removed Harry as a suspect in the eyes of many of the students, as they knew he would never harm Hermione. Some students even offered him an apology, such as [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]].\n\n[[File:Cloak of Invisibility 1992.gif|250px|thumb|left|Harry and Ron visit Hagrid right before he is taken to [[Azkaban]]]]\nHarry and Ron decided they now must talk to Hagrid. With the now constant supervision on students, this was not easy, but they managed to do it by using Harry's Invisibility cloak. When they reach [[Hagrid's Hut|Hagrid's cabin]], Harry and Ron managed to hide just before Dumbledore and [[Minister for Magic]] [[Cornelius Fudge]] arrived at the scene. Fudge announced that Hagrid, who to the best of his knowledge opened the Chamber of Secrets the last time, would be sent to wizard prison Azkaban as a precaution. They were shortly joined by [[Lucius Malfoy]], who declared that he and the other Hogwarts governors unanimously voted to suspend Dumbledore, despite the obvious logic that this would only worsen the situation. Both Hagrid and Dumbledore gave last words, but Hagrid covertly suggested to Harry and Ron that if they want the truth, they should \"follow the spiders\", and Dumbledore said that he would only truly have left the school when none there remained loyal to him. He also stressed that if anybody at Hogwarts needed help, it would always be available.\n\n=====Visit to Aragog's lair=====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Aragog|The thing that lives in the castle is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.|Harry|What is it?|We do not speak of it!

Walking along the trails of the spiders, which were strangely all fleeing [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], take them into the [[Forbidden Forest]]. Even though Ron was deeply arachnophobic, the fact that Hermione had been petrified and that they may be able to help through this investigation gave him the willpower to go along anyway. There, they encountered the [[Flying Ford Anglia|Ford Anglia]], which had apparently taken to driving through the forest like some sort of wild animal. They eventually meet Aragog, a giant spider which had been the monster Hagrid had been \"caught\" setting on other students fifty years ago. Aragog explained that [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] was innocent, but rather than letting Harry and Ron go, he decided to leave them as dinner for his children. [[Arthur Weasley|Mr Weasley]]'s Ford Anglia came blasting through the layers of spiders, however, and assisted the boys' escape.\n\nAfter this, Harry and Ron felt that they had reached dead ends everywhere, until one possible last hope occurred to them. Aragog said the monster's last victim died in a bathroom, and it occurred to Harry that [[Myrtle Warren]] might have been that victim. Of course, with the school under such security, it would be almost impossible to sneak in the girls' bathroom near where the first attack occurred.\n\n=====The last attack=====\n{{Quote|HER SKELETON WILL LIE IN THE CHAMBER FOREVER|The final message on the wall|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}[[File:Petrification.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Hermione Granger]] and the other petrified students being visited by Harry and Ron]]\nLater that same day, Harry and Ron managed to trick Lockhart \u2014 who was leading them to their next class \u2014 into letting them go by stroking his ego. Just as they patted themselves on the back, they were caught by [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], and Harry had to make up an excuse \u2014 they were going to see Hermione in the [[Hospital Wing]], where visitors were now barred. They now had to go along to make their story appear convincing, but rather than simply hanging around Hermione's petrified form, this time Harry noticed a piece of paper tightly clutched in her hand.\n\nThis piece of paper revealed what Hermione had found out before she was attacked. She discovered, based on strong circumstantial evidence, that the monster in the Chamber of Secrets was a [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk]] (a giant slithering serpent capable of feeding on human and animal aura to cause petrifaction and death to anyone near it via direct eye contact), which explained why only Harry could hear it. But none of its victims died because they didn't look at its gaze directly: [[Colin Creevey]] saw it through his camera, [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]] saw it through [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly-Headless Nick]] (who was already dead), Mrs Norris saw its reflection in the waters from the flooded bathroom, and Hermione used a mirror to look around corners after figuring things out. There was also a note about how spiders feared the Basilisk (which explained them fleeing Hogwarts) and the rooster's call being potentially fatal to it (which explains Hagrid's roosters having been mysteriously killed during the year). This summed up the years events.\n\n[[File:Writing on the Wall.png|250px|thumb|The message written on the wall after Ginevra Weasley is taken into the Chamber of Secrets]]\nOn the note was also scribbled a single word, \"pipes\", which meant that the serpent moved around through the plumbing. Having solved the mystery, Harry and Ron decided to go to the staff room and report to the teachers. When they got there, they overheard the teachers talking about another attack has occurred. Harry and Ron decided to hide to hear more details, and learning that Ginny had been kidnapped and the heir of [[Slytherin]] had left another message under the previous one: Harry and Ron also heard that [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] would be closed the following day. The teachers then forced [[Gilderoy Lockhart|Lockhart]] to deal with the monster, as he had been claiming he could handle whatever was responsible for the attacks, irritating the rest of the staff to no end. Looking very crestfallen, he left for his room.\n\n=====Discovery in the bathroom=====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Moaning Myrtle|I died in this very stall. I remember it so well...

Harry and Ron decided that if Lockhart was going to deal with the monster they might as well tell him what they knew. They went to his room, only to find him frantically packing, having decided to run away. When questioned on why such a talented [[Wizardkind|wizard]] as himself was leaving, Lockhart admitted that he was a fraud and that he put [[Memory Charm]]s on the people who really did the things that he claimed to have done in his books.\n\n[[File:Harry-potter2-chamber entrance.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry, Ron, and Lockhart discover the entrance to the [[Chamber of Secrets]]]]\nHe then attempted to put a memory charm on Harry and Ron as well.

She stated that the last thing she saw was a pair of enormous eyes by one of the sinks. This sink incidentally had a tap that had never worked. Harry came to the conclusion that the tap can only be opened by the use of [[Parseltongue]]. He found a snake carved on the tap and then opened the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.\n\n[[File:B2C16M3 Snake entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.png|250px|thumb|The entrance into the main section of the chamber]]\nHarry, Ron, and Lockhart slid down a large pipe and found themselves in maze-like tunnels far under the school. Down there, they encountered a snake skin left by the [[Serpent of Slytherin|basilisk]]. Just then, Lockhart feigned fainting and stole Ron's wand. Victoriously proclaiming that he would erase Harry and Ron's memories and tell everybody they lost their sanity at the sight of Ginny's mangled body, Lockhart attempted a spell. [[Charles Weasley's wand|Ron's broken wand]] caused the charm to backfire, erasing Lockhart's memory and causing a portion of the ceiling to cave in. This trapped Harry in the direction of the chamber and Ron in the direction of the castle. Ron had no choice but to stay behind and clear a path through the rocks while Harry continued in search of Ginny. Harry then encountered a wall with stone snakes on it, opened it by speaking [[Parseltongue]], and enters the Chamber itself.\n\n=====The Chamber of Secrets=====\n{{Main|Skirmish in the Chamber of Secrets}}\n{{Dialogue|Harry|Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time...|Tom Riddle|Voldemort is my past, present, and future, Harry Potter...|Tom Riddle reveals that he is in fact Lord Voldemort|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\n[[File:B2C16M3 Chamber of Secrets revealed.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry in the entrance chamber of the [[Chamber of Secrets]]]]\nInside, he found Ginny lying on the ground, pale and cold. He dropped [[Harry Potter's wand|his wand]] and ran to her, trying to get a response from her, but to no avail. He then saw [[Tom Riddle]] smiling at him and holding Harry's wand. Riddle explained his presence in the present by revealing he was a memory, which had been preserved in his diary for fifty years.\n\nHe then explained what had happened. Riddle had opened the [[Chamber of Secrets]] fifty years ago and planned to purge the school of [[Muggle-born]]s and half-bloods; however, when he learned that the school was going to close down due to the attacks and that Dumbledore (then the [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] teacher) was keeping a closer and closer watch on him, he had no choice but to cease the attacks and frame [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] for doing it. Not wanting to waste all the years he spent on figuring out where the chamber was and how to get to it, he left behind a diary containing the memory of his sixteen-year-old self in hopes that it would, one day, fall into the hands of an unsuspecting victim who would help him finish his work.\n\n[[File:B2C17M1 Harry Ginny Tom Chamber of Secrets.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry and an unconscious Ginny in the main chamber, with Riddle watching]]\nGinny had been writing in the [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|diary]] all year. Riddle had written back sympathetically and Ginny grew to confess her fears, hopes and feelings to him. She essentially poured some of her soul into him, which was exactly what he wanted. He gradually grew more powerful and eventually managed to pour some of his soul back into her, possessing her and using her body to open the chamber and launch the new series of attacks. However, eventually Ginny became suspicious of the diary and decided to get rid of it by flushing it down the toilet in [[Myrtle Warren]]'s bathroom. This is when Harry found it. When Ginny saw Harry with the diary on Valentine's Day, she panicked and worried that Riddle had told all of her secrets to Harry, so she stole it back from Harry's dormitory. It began taking control of her again, but this time with the intention of killing Harry, so he had Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down to wait, luring Harry to the rescue and, consequently, his doom.\n\n[[File:I am Lord Voldemort.gif|250px|thumb|left|''I am Lord Voldemort'']]\nRiddle then asked how Harry managed to defeat the [[Dark Wizard]] [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] as a mere baby. Harry asks Riddle why he cares, as Voldemort existed after his time. Riddle replies that Voldemort was his ''\"past, present and future.''\" He then wrote his name in the air with Harry's wand: TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE Riddle then waved the wand and the letters rearrange themselves into I AM LORD VOLDEMORT. Needless to say, this meant Riddle grew up to become Lord Voldemort. Riddle then revealed he was, in fact, a [[half-blood]], and his mother had named him Tom after his Muggle father and Marvolo after his [[Wizardkind|wizard]] grandfather, a descendant of [[Salazar Slytherin]]. He scrambled his \"filthy Muggle father's name\" to create a new one, which he knew people would fear when he became the most powerful wizard in the world.\n\n=====Battling the Basilisk=====\n{{Quote|Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter.|Tom Riddle unleashes the basilisk|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\nHarry retorted that he must be mistaken, because the greatest [[Wizardkind|wizard]] in the world, as everybody knew, was not [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] but Dumbledore. Even when Voldemort was at the peak of his power, he was afraid of Dumbledore, and now he was barely alive. Riddle angrily answered that Dumbledore had been driven out the castle by the mere memory of him. Harry yelled that Dumbledore was not as gone as Riddle seemed to believe. In this display of loyalty, he summoned [[Fawkes]] the [[phoenix]] to him, who also brought with him the [[Sorting Hat]], both assets that Riddle deems extremely useless.\n\n[[File:COS piercing through Serpent of Slytherin.gif|250px|thumb|right|Harry slays Slytherin's basilisk with the [[Sword of Gryffindor]]]]\nRiddle then [[Skirmish in the Chamber of Secrets|summoned]] the [[Serpent of Slytherin|basilisk]] and commanded it to kill Harry. However, [[Fawkes]] was not as defenceless as one might initially think, and pecked out the basilisk's eyes, thus preventing its gaze from killing. The basilisk could still smell Harry, however, and remained very dangerous; Harry, in desperation, put on the [[Sorting Hat]], wishing against hope for help. Instead of an answer, Harry had a heavy sword with a hilt embedded with rubies fall on his head from inside the hat. After several missed strikes from the blinded basilisk, Harry plunged the sword into the roof of its mouth, killing it. However, one of its poisonous fangs sank into his arm, injecting a deadly poison. While Riddle gloated over his \"win\", Fawkes proceeded to cry on the wound and Harry was instantly cured.\n\n[[File:HarryPotter PM B2C17M3 HarryStabbingDiaryWithBasiliskFang Moment.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry stabbing Tom Riddle's diary with a Basilisk fang (unknowingly destroying one of Voldemort's Horcruxes)]]\nHarry then stabbed the diary three times with the Basilisk fang to rid himself of Riddle, unknowingly destroying one of Voldemort's Horcruxes in the process. Riddle's manifestation exploded, therefore foiling his attempt to come back to life. Ink began pouring out of the book and the memory of Riddle faded out of existence; Ginny immediately stirred and woke up, quite distraught. Harry and Ginny travelled back through the Chamber to find Ron and Lockhart, who had no idea of who or where he was.\n\n=====Escaping the chamber=====\n{{Dialogue|Ron Weasley|He looks like he wants you to grab hold... But you're much too heavy for a bird to pull up there \u2014|Harry|Fawkes isn't an ordinary bird.|Harry and others escape the chamber with the aid of Fawkes|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\nHarry, Ron, Ginny and Lockhart grabbed onto [[Fawkes]] and flew out of the Chamber (another [[phoenix]] specialty). They returned to the castle to find Dumbledore, [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]], [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Molly Weasley]], who were delighted to see them alive. Harry worried that Ginny would get blamed for being the person behind the attacks, but to his great relief Dumbledore rightly deduced that [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] was the culprit. After Ginny left to get a much-needed rest, Harry and Ron both received 200 house points each for [[Gryffindor]] and both got an Award for Special Services to the school. Dumbledore then gave Ron Hagrid's release paper for him to mail and then spoke with Harry alone.\n\n[[File:B2C18M1 Sword of Gryffindor engraving.png|250px|thumb|Harry and Dumbledore talk after Harry slayed the Basilisk in the chamber]]\nHarry expressed his concern that he belonged in [[Slytherin]]. Dumbledore revealed that [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] transferred some of his powers to Harry when he gave him his scar, explaining his ability to speak [[Parseltongue]]. He asked Harry why he thought the [[Sorting Hat]] put him in [[Gryffindor]] if he had so many Slytherin qualities, and Harry admitted that the only reason it did was because he had asked it to. Dumbledore confirmed this and told Harry that \"''it is our choices, rather than our abilities, that reveal who we truly are''\". He also commends Harry for showing him real loyalty in the Chamber, for only that could've called Fawkes to his aid. He pointed out to the sword Harry had drawn out of the hat - Harry now noticed it had [[Godric Gryffindor]]'s name on it. Dumbledore said that only a true [[Gryffindor]] would be able to draw it out.\n\n=====Dobby's reward=====\n{{Dialogue|Lucius Malfoy|You lost me my servant!|Dobby|You shall not harm Harry Potter!|Dobby defends Harry after the latter frees him from servitude|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}[[Lucius Malfoy]] barged into Dumbledore's office, outraged that Dumbledore had returned to the school after being dismissed. Dumbledore calmly responded that the governors had asked him to return once they heard that [[Arthur Weasley]]'s daughter was attacked. Apparently they had been blackmailed by Lucius to vote for Dumbledore's dismissal in the first place on pain of Lucius cursing their families. [[Dobby]] followed Lucius into the room, thus showing that his masters were the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]].\n\n[[File:Chamber-of-secrets-lucius harry.jpg|250px|thumb|left]]\nDumbledore and [[Lucius Malfoy|Malfoy]] had a calm and venomous interchange (respectively), during which Dumbledore and Harry (with the help of [[Dobby]]'s unspoken hints) essentially exposed Lucius sneaking [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|Riddle's diary]] (one of his illegal artefacts) into Ginny's school things during the fight with Arthur at [[Flourish and Blotts]]. This was supposed to frame Ginny for the attacks, with heavy implications on the [[Muggle Protection Act]] [[Arthur Weasley]] had been suggesting. Malfoy dared Dumbledore to prove his accusation, and while the Headmaster has insufficient evidence to do that, he cautioned Malfoy against orchestrating further such plots.\n\nKnowing that a master could release his [[house-elf]] by giving them some clothes, Harry tricked [[Lucius Malfoy|Malfoy]] into freeing [[Dobby]] by giving Malfoy one of his own socks, which he promptly threw away, and was caught by Dobby. Malfoy, after discovering Harry's trick, attempted to kill Harry, only to be stopped by Dobby. Dobby thanked Harry dearly for freeing him and left. At the ending feast, Dumbledore announced his school treat of cancelling all final exams (much to Hermione's dismay) and that Lockhart would not return to Hogwarts.\n\n====Third year====\n{{Dialogue a-b-c|Hermione Granger|Sirius Black escaped to come after you?

Throughout the preceding summer, the Dursleys became fearful of his magical abilities getting exposed that they banned him from talking to the neighbours immediately after his return home to them. They even went as far as punishing him for giving their phone number to his friends, as evident to Harry getting reprimanded by [[Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]] when the latter received a call from Ron. This, however, did not stop Harry from studying magic every night by sneaking his school supplies and hiding them in his room one night while [[Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]] and [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] were out admiring Vernon's new company car. Furthermore, he had little contact with his friends nor any news from the wizarding world since the phone incident, but [[Hedwig]] was allowed out of her padlocked cage because the Dursleys could no longer take the noise she made in boredom.\n\nOn [[31 July]] (Harry's [[Harry Potter's thirteenth birthday|thirteenth birthday]]), which might have made the Dursleys forget about his birthday, for they were too busy preparing for a visit from Aunt Marge. The sight of a copy of the ''Daily Prophet ''among the mail from Errol interested Harry, as it said that Ron had returned from a trip to [[Egypt]] to visit his oldest brother [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] (a [[Curse-Breaker]] of [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]]) for which [[Arthur Weasley]] paid using seven hundred galleons he won in the [[Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw]]. The article also showcased a picture of the Weasleys standing in front of a pyramid. It was there that Ron bought Harry the most fascinating present: a [[Sneakoscope]], which was sold for tourists. He also received birthday presents from Hermione and Hagrid as well.\n\n[[File:Marge starts to inflate.gif|250px|thumb|left|A enraged Harry inflates [[Marjorie Dursley|Marge Dursley]]]]\nWhen his [[Hogsmeade permission form]] was delivered, Harry was worried of the trouble he'll probably go through in order to persuade his aunt or uncle to sign it. They agreed to do so the next morning, but only if he behaved during Marge's visit. However, Marge began insulting the memory of Harry's mother at the dinner table three days later, describing her as a \"bad egg\" who ran off with a \"scoundrel\" and left the Dursleys with Harry as the \"result in front of them\". Harry lost his temper to this, inadvertently making Marge's wine glass explode. The insults transitioned to his father on the final day of her visit, making him very upset to such extent that he ended up losing all control of his magic powers and [[Inflation of Marjorie Dursley|accidentally inflated her]] with the [[Inflating Charm]]. Vernon ordered his nephew to put Marge back the way she was, but Harry said no and instead packed up his school things and left the house. He fled out of fear of being expelled from Hogwarts by the [[Ministry of Magic]], for using underage magic outside school, something he had already been warned about.\n\nLater that night, Harry was picked up off the curb of [[Magnolia Crescent]] by the triple-decker wizard transport the [[Knight Bus]], which was sent to drive him as two members of the Ministry's [[Accidental Magic Reversal Squad]] were dispatched to deflate and [[Memory Charm|Obliviate]] Marge. During the ride to the [[Leaky Cauldron]], the bus' conductor [[Stanley Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]] gave him a copy of the ''Daily Prophet'' with its front page story being about the Ministry's continuing struggle to recapture [[Sirius Black]], a convicted Voldemort supporter who recently escaped from the wizard prison [[Azkaban]] (the first person ever to have done so) after spending twelve years there for the mass-murder of thirteen people with a single [[Blasting Curse]].\n\n[[File:Harry-potter4-movie-screencaps.com-1579.jpg|250px|thumb|Minister Cornelius Fudge personally sees that Harry is safe]]\nThey arrived at their destination to find a relieved-looking [[Cornelius Fudge]] waiting at the restaurant door to welcome Harry in for a meeting. To Harry's relief though, the [[Minister for Magic]] took no action against him since accidental uses of magic did not count as a violation to the [[Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery]], but described the choice of running away as very irresponsible despite it putting the Ministry in a right flap. As a generous measure, Fudge booked the young wizard a room in the Leaky Cauldron Inn for the rest of the summer, though this made something about Fudge's tone spike Harry's suspicion.\n\n=====Stay at the Leaky Cauldron=====\n{{Dialogue|Molly Weasley|But no one's really sure that Black's after Harry.|Arthur Weasley|The guards told Fudge that Blacks been talking in his sleep for a while now. Always the same words: 'He's at Hogwarts... he's at Hogwarts.' Black is deranged, Molly, and he wants Harry dead.|Harry finds out that Sirius Black supposedly wants him dead|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}\nWhen finished with his exploration of [[Diagon Alley]] for school supplies three weeks later, Harry found Ron and Hermione looking all over for him at [[Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour]] four days afterwards while the Weasleys were booking a room at the inn. They already heard of his inflation of Marge, and while Ron thought it funny, Hermione was amazed to learn that Harry was not expelled and wondered why Fudge really let him off the hook. Ron, however, was more concerned for his pet rat [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]], who was looking very ill since he was brought back from Egypt (possibly due to the stress of the trip), so he and Harry went over to the [[Magical Menagerie]] to buy a bottle of [[rat tonic]] for him.\n\n[[File:Magical Menagerie.png|250px|thumb|left|[[Crookshanks]] in Magical Menagerie right before being purchased by Hermione]]\nWhile in Diagon Alley, Harry found it very interesting to learn from the [[Magical Menagerie saleswoman|saleswoman]] behind the counter that most rats have an expected life span of three years. He found this odd, since Scabbers originally belonged to Ron's older brother [[Percy Weasley]]. Thus Scabbers lived much longer than Ron could remember, at least 12 years. As Ron declined the Saleswoman's offer to buy a sleek black rat as a replacement, a half-[[Kneazle]] [[cat]] named Crookshanks tried to attack Scabbers, who scurried away to hide in a wastepaper bin outside [[Quality Quidditch Supplies]] with his owner and Harry following. Hermione spent the early birthday money from her parents to buy the tonic and Crookshanks, much to Ron's displeasure.\n\n[[File:Harry-potter4-warning.jpg|250px|thumb|Arthur Weasley warns Harry of the danger that he is possibly in]]\nWhen the rat tonic was misplaced somewhere around the Leaky Cauldron salon later that night, Harry volunteered to search for it there while Ron was busy helping Percy search for his new [[Head Boy or Girl badge|Head Boy badge]] in their room at the inn. But the conversation which a worried [[Molly Weasley]] was having with her husband soon caught his attention, so Harry listened to what they were saying about Sirius Black's escape, and what connection it had to Harry himself. According to Mr Weasley, when Voldemort met his downfall, Black lost everything he hoped to gain, but to that day he remained a faithful servant to the Dark Lord's cause.\n\nThe Ministry feared that the killer's motive was to use Harry to return his master to full strength, as evident to the report from Fudge's inspection of [[Azkaban]] saying that Black was repeatedly muttering \"''He's at Hogwarts''\" in his sleep. This shook Harry a little to the realisation that Fudge let him go because he was relieved to see Harry all right after running away. Though he was convinced that Hogwarts was a a safe haven because of the presence of Albus Dumbledore, the senior Weasleys agreed that Black could break into the school if he could break out of his Azkaban.\n\n=====Delay on the Hogwarts Express=====\n{{Quote|Standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering flames in Lupin's hand, was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling.

An intense cold swept over them all.|Harry's first encounter with a guard of Azkaban|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}\n[[File:Harry vs Dementor.gif|250px|thumb|left]]\nWhen they got onto [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters|Platform 9\u00be]], Mr Weasley moved Harry aside to tell him not to go looking for Black, but Harry claimed that he would never look for someone who wanted him killed. He, Ron and Hermione found only one empty compartment on the Hogwarts Express, but had to share with a friend of Harry's parents, [[Remus Lupin]], who was recently appointed Hogwarts' new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[professor]]. As Harry told his friends of what he heard about Black coming after him until, the train stopped almost halfway to Hogwarts, letting one of the [[Dementor]]s (a gliding wraith capable of feeding on human happiness to cause depression and madness to anyone near it via mental energy draining) used as the Azkaban guards aboard to determine if Black himself was hiding on it.\n\nOnly Harry and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] were the most affected by the creature (since he had the worst past involving the night Voldemort killed his parents, and she had the worst experience of being under the control of the sentient memory within [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|Voldemort's old school diary]] the year before), and were about to fall victim to [[Dementor's Kiss|its fatal kiss]] when Lupin cast a [[Patronus Charm]] which drove it away. Harry fainted to the sound of his mother screaming, but recovered when Lupin gave him a piece of chocolate to feel better and sent a letter ahead to [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor Minerva McGonagall]] saying he was ill.\n\n[[File:B3C6M3.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry's first [[Care of Magical Creatures]] lessons involving hippogriffs]]\nFor one, Hermione was taking nearly twice as many classes, including some taught at the same time. [[Rubeus Hagrid]] for Care of Magical Creatures. While Lupin's lessons were enjoyable, Hagrid's soon become dreary. During the first lesson, [[Draco Malfoy]] deliberately provoked the [[hippogriff]] [[Buckbeak]] into attacking him. This in turn forced [[Lucius Malfoy]] to file a complaint against Hagrid with the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Meanwhile, tensions grew between Hermione and Ron over Crookshanks' continuing habit of trying to harm Scabbers.\n\n[[File:B3C11M1 Confiscating Firebolt.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry receives a Firebolt for Christmas that is shortly confiscated by McGonagall]]\nAfter several Dementors approached Harry during a [[Quidditch]] match, causing him to faint and fall off his broomstick. [[Albus Dumbledore]] stopped Harry's fall, but his [[Nimbus 2000]] flew into the [[Whomping Willow]] and was destroyed, much to Harry's dismay. At Christmas, Harry received a new, superb [[Firebolt]] [[broomstick]], although Hermione suspected Black was the anonymous donor. She reported it to Professor [[Minerva McGonagall]], who confiscated the broom for testing. Harry and Ron were furious with Hermione and they stopped speaking to her. When the broom was returned some months later, the two boys tried to make up with her, but it went wrong when Ron discovered Scabbers was missing; Ron blamed Crookshanks because he found cat hairs and blood on his dormitory floor.\n\n=====Maurader's Map=====\n{{Dialogue a-b-c-d-e|George Weasley|This, Harry, is the secret of our success.|Fred Weasley|It's a wrench, giving it to you, but we decided last night, your need's greater than ours.|George Weasley|Anyway, we know it off by heart.

Harry used a tunnel to sneak into Hogsmeade village, where he overheard a disturbing conversation that [[Sirius Black]] was his parents' best friend, as well as his godfather and legal guardian. Black was the Potters' [[Secret Keeper]] and he allegedly divulged the Potters' secret whereabouts to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and murdered their friend [[Peter Pettigrew]], as well as twelve [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] bystanders.

Harry and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] finally made peace with [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], but the trio soon learned that [[Buckbeak]] would be executed. When they visited [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] to console him, [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]] appeared, and Ron picked him up. [[Cornelius Fudge]], [[Albus Dumbledore]] and the executioner were making their way to Hagrid's hut, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione made their way out the back door. As they were walking up the path, they thought they heard Buckbeak executed, when all of a sudden, Scabbers bit Ron, and Ron chased him to the [[Whomping Willow]]. A large dog attacked Ron and dragged him and Scabbers into a hole at the tree's base. Harry and Hermione followed, finding a tunnel leading to the [[Shrieking Shack]].

Lupin and Black explained that Scabbers was actually Peter Pettigrew in his [[Animagus]] form. He was [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s servant, and he betrayed the Potters (as Black had switched his position as Secret-Keeper with Pettigrew), framing Black for the crimes.\n\nHarry was sceptical, until Black and Lupin forced Pettigrew back into his human form. This came as a huge shock to Harry, Ron, and Hermione, especially Ron. Black then explained he discovered that Pettigrew was still alive and escaped [[Azkaban]] to seek revenge, as well as to make sure that Pettigrew could not harm Harry. Harry stopped Black and Lupin from murdering Pettigrew, believing that his father would not have wanted his two best friends to become killers.\n\n=====Saving the innocent=====\n{{Quote|f you succeed tonight, more than one innocent life may be spared.|Dumbledore's parting words to Harry and Hermione|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}As the group headed back to the castle, the full moon rose, causing [[Remus Lupin|Lupin]] to turn into a [[werewolf]]. During the ensuing commotion, [[Peter Pettigrew|Pettigrew]] escaped, while [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] turned into his dog form to protect the others from Lupin. Lupin fled, leaving Black badly injured. As Dementors moved in to attack Black, Harry saw a mysterious figure in the distance cast a powerful stag-shaped [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], scattering the vicious creatures. Harry became convinced it was his father, or at least his father's spirit, who produced the Patronus. Black was then captured and taken to the castle where the Dementors intended to suck out his soul.\n\n[[File:Turning time.gif|250px|thumb|left|Harry and Hermione use the Time-Turner in order to save Buckbeak and Sirius Black]]\n[[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] revealed to Harry that she was entrusted with a time-travelling device, called a [[Time-Turner]], which was how she was able to attend so many classes. Prompted by [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], she and Harry travelled three hours into the past, watching themselves go through the night's previous events. They freed [[Buckbeak]] and returned to the [[Whomping Willow]]. As the Dementors were about to attack the \"other\" Harry and Sirius, Harry realised that the mysterious figure he saw earlier was actually himself. He cast the powerful [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] that repelled the dementors. Harry and Hermione freed Black, who escaped on Buckbeak, as they rushed back to where they were before. As they saw Dumbledore exiting the hospital wing, they completed their journey.\n\n[[File:B3C21M4 Sirius flying off on Buckbeak.png|250px|thumb|Harry and Hermione rescue Sirius and Buckbeak]]\nAfter Sirius was revealed to have once again escaped, [[Severus Snape]] burst into the hospital wing and blamed Harry, but left when he was unable to convince anyone without any proof.

On the train back, Harry received a letter from Sirius, telling him that he sent him the [[Firebolt]], and included a letter giving Harry permission to visit [[Hogsmeade]]. The letter was delivered by a small minute owl, which Sirius gives to Ron as a replacement for Scabbers.

Things only get worse form that point forward and results in Vernon throwing figurines at Mr Weasley.\n\n[[File:B4C7M1 Quidditch World Cup Campsite.png|250px|thumb|Harry attends the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]] with Herrmione and the Weasleys]]\nOn [[25 August]], [[1994]] Harry, the [[Weasley family|Weasley]] family (besides [[Molly Weasley|Mrs Weasley]]), and Hermione Granger attended the Quidditch World Cup. At Stoatshead Hill, Cedric Diggory and his father, [[Amos Diggory|Amos]] joined them. Once at the camp grounds, they met Ludo Bagman, Barty Crouch Snr with his house-elf Winky, and many other Hogwarts students and their families, including: [[Seamus Finnigan]], [[Dean Thomas]], [[Oliver Wood]], and [[Draco Malfoy]]. They were able to see the match between the Irish and [[Bulgarian National Quidditch team|Bulgarian]] national teams up close, because Harry, the Weasleys, and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] had seats in the Top Box, thanks to a favour Mr Weasley had done for [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]]. It was during this World Cup that Harry learned of the existence of foreign wizarding schools, something he had not given any thought to before the cup.\n\n=====Reappearance of the Dark Mark=====\n{{Dialogue a-b|Harry|Death Eaters? What are [[Death Eaters]]?|Bill Weasley|It's what You-Know-Who's supporters called themselves.

They also proceeded to pillage and destroy everything in sight. On Mr Weasley's orders, Harry fled into the woods near the camp site, along with Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny. The group was separated in the woods and the trio were on their own. In the chaos Harry had lost his wand, he speculated that it most have fallen out of his pocket at some point. The trio ran into [[Draco Malfoy]] in the woods, and he all but told them that his father was among the cloaked wizards. Malfoy also gave a nasty bit of advice to the trio regarding Hermione's blood status, saying that she would be safer out of the hooded figures' sight. \n\n[[File:The trio seeing the Dark Mark.png|250px|thumb|The reappearance of the Dark Mark at the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]]]]\nLater, Harry learned that [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] had stolen his wand from his pocket. While in a clearing in the woods, Harry, Ron, and Hermione heard someone shout the incantation ''[[Morsmordre]]'', casting the [[Dark Mark]] \u2014 a green skull with a snake protruding from its mouth like a tongue \u2014 into the sky. Although Harry did not immediately recognise its significance, he soon learned that the Dark Mark had evil implications. Then, Barty Crouch Snr, Amos Diggory, and other [[Ministry of Magic]] employees [[Apparition|Apparated]] into the clearing and began to question Harry, Ron, and Hermione about the Dark Mark. After Harry mentioned he had heard another voice conjure the Dark Mark, the Ministry employees searched the area and found the [[house-elf]] [[Winky]] unconscious in the bushes. Since Harry's wand was found in Winky's hand, Mr Crouch fired her for bringing shame to his family.\n\n=====\"Mad-Eye\" Moody=====\n{{Quote|Not pleasant. And there's no [[counter-curse]].

Only one known person has ever survived it, and he's sitting right in front of me|Harry is the only known survivor of the Killing Curse|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\nAt the Hogwarts start-of-term feast, [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] announced that [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] would host the [[Triwizard Tournament]], a recently revived inter-school competition in which the [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]] and the [[Durmstrang Institute]] would also participate. New rules stated that only students seventeen and older could compete, for safety reasons. Also, during the start of term feast, Dumbledore introduced [[Alastor Moody|\"Mad-Eye\" Moody]], an ex-Auror, as the newly appointed [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor. This news was greeted with a mixture of responses, as Moody was known to be a great [[Auror]], a little crazy, and to have a magical eye, earning him the nickname \"Mad-Eye\" Moody.\n\n[[File:B4C14M1 DADA Unforgivable Curses.png|250px|thumb|left|A Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson on the Unforgivable Curses]]\nDuring the first lesson with Moody on a Thursday, he reveals tht he will only be staying for the year and decides to show the fourth-year Gryffindors the [[Unforgivable Curses]]. Despite some fear amongst the students (especially Neville, who needs comfort from both the trio and Moody after the lesson; Moody later lends Neville a [[Herbology]] book to cheer him up), Moody shows the entire class the three curses using spiders as his test subjects: the [[Imperius Curse]], [[Cruciatus Curse]], and [[Killing Curse]] . He also reveals the the use of these spells gain the user a one way ticket to Azkaban.\n\n=====The Goblet of Fire=====\n{{Dialogue|Harry|I didn't put my name in that Goblet!|Ron Weasley|Yeah, okay.|Ron and the student body are sceptical of Harry|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\n[[File:B4C16M1 Champions chosen v1.png|250px|thumb|The [[Goblet of Fire]] selects Harry as the unexpected fourth champion]]\nAround Hallowe'en, the students from Beauxbatons Academy of Magic and Durmstrang Institute arrived at the school. The arrival of famous international Quidditch Star Viktor Krum caused a lot of excitement, particularly among girls. [[Viktor Krum]], [[Fleur Delacour]], and [[Cedric Diggory]] were all chosen to represent their respective schools in this tournament. However, Harry was mysteriously chosen as a fourth competitor. This came as a shock for all those present, due to the fact that he was under-age and that he never entered his name into the [[Goblet of Fire]] during the selection process. Many people (even Ron and fellow [[Gryffindor]]s) did not believe Harry's story. They thought this to be nothing but another attempt to gain even more fame and eternal glory. This caused extreme tension between the two friends and they did not speak again for a long time. Ron started spending more time with [[Dean Thomas]] and [[Seamus Finnigan]].\n\nHermione on the other hand \"''accepted his story without question''\" and explains the reason behind Ron's recent actions toward Harry, stating that it steams from jealousy. She later assisted Harry in preparing for the Tournament by teaching him useful spells, such as the [[Summoning Charm]]. Harry used this charm in the first task of the Tournament. The champions were to face three dangerous challenges on their way to the Triwizard Cup. These challenges were in correspondence to the four elements. \n\n[[File:Harry-potter-goblet-rita, harry, and hermione.jpg|250px|thumb|left]]\nA few days after his name unexpectedly came out of the Goblet, Harry attended the [[wand weighing ceremony]], where his wand was inspected. After examining the other champion's wands, Ollivander examines Harry's and deems it in perfect condition. After the champions and judges go through a long photoshoot, Harry goes to dinner and then returns to [[Gryffindor Tower]]. Once in the tower Ron tells him that he has an owl and that their detention starts later. The letter is from Sirius telling Harry he will contact him on 22 November at 1:00 a.m. Harry must be alone at the fireplace in the Gryffindor common room at that time. There the notorious ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' reporter [[Rita Skeeter]] asked him many leading questions, took everything he said out of context, and wrote a ludicrous article about him and Hermione.\n\n[[File:Densaugeo and Furnunculus.png|250px|thumb|The result of [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] and Harry's duel outside of Potions Class, after having teased Harry]]\nThis article was titled \"''HARRY POTTER'S SECRET HEARTACHE''\". The piece claimed that Hermione was Harry's girlfriend and that she was toying him around by seeking the affections of [[Viktor Krum]], who himself was very much smitten with her. Harry faced even more turmoil during this time, as the majority of the student body was making everyday life difficult for him. [[Hufflepuff]] believed that Harry was stealing spotlight from their house and Draco Malfoy was doing everything in his power to make Harry even more miserable. He accomplished this by making and mass producing \"POTTER STINKS\" badges, which many students proceeded to wear around. Malfoy had also taking to commenting and reading aloud Rita Skeeter's articles every chance he got, making Harry very uncomfortable.\n\n=====The First Task=====\n{{Dialogue|Ludo Bagman|Look at that! Will you look at that! Our youngest champion is quickest to get his [[Golden egg|egg]]! Well, this is going to shorten the odds on Mr Potter!|McGonagall|That was excellent, Potter!|Harry takes the lead in the Tournament after the First Task|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\nIn the first task, each champion needed to get past a [[dragon]] in order to collect a [[golden egg]]. Harry received help from [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], who showed the dragons to him and Madam Maxime. Realising that every champion but Cedric had found out about the dragons, Harry told Cedric about the first task. He did this as a way of levelling the playing field. The newly appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Alastor Moody, witnessed Harry telling Cedric but did not report him. Instead he advised Harry to play to his strengths, hinting that he should use his [[Flight|flying]] ability to get the golden egg.\n\n[[File:Horntail \u2013 first task.png|250px|thumb|left|Harry faces a [[Hungarian Horntail]] in the first task of the Triwizard Tournament]]\nFour different dragons were chosen for each of the champions to face. On [[24 November]], Fleur ended up with the [[Common Welsh Green]], Cedric with the [[Swedish Short-Snout]], Viktor Krum with the [[Chinese Fireball]], and Harry faced the Hungarian Horntail (the most dangerous of the four). Harry used a Summoning Charm to bring him his Firebolt and dodged the Hungarian Horntail to get the golden egg. Harry escaped the dangerous task with a mild cut to the arm, due to being grazed by one of the Horntail's spikes. He also proved to be the fastest when it came to capturing his egg, which earned him a compliment from Professor McGonagall. He and Viktor Krum tied for first at the end of the task. After seeing how dangerous the task was, Ron decided that Harry did not put his own name in the Goblet. He made amends with Harry.\n\n=====Yule Ball=====\n{{Dialogue|Harry|Dance partners? I don't dance.|McGonagall|Oh yes, you do. That's what I'm telling you. Traditionally, the champions and their partners open the ball.|The unexpected task of finding a date|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\nBetween the first and second tasks, the [[Yule Ball]], a Triwizard Tournament tradition took place on Christmas. [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], dismayed to discover that Viktor Krum had asked Hermione to go with him, called her out for \"''consorting with the enemy''\", though he and Hermione acted as if they had not fought the following day. Harry asked his long-time crush [[Cho Chang]] to attend the Yule Ball with him, but was disappointed to learn that she had already accepted an invitation from Cedric Diggory, a fellow champion. Harry and Ron ended up attending with Parvati and [[Padma Patil]], respectively.\n\n[[File:Yule ball dance.JPG|250px|thumb|Harry and Parvati dancing at the Yule Ball on Christmas Day]]\nWhile at the ball both Harry and Ron ended up neglecting their dates. Harry watched Cho with Cedric and Ron was overcome with jealousy for Viktor Krum, who danced with Hermione. After the Yule Ball, Rita Skeeter struck again. She had overheard Hagrid telling [[Olympe Maxime|Madame Maxime]] about his family and his heritage. She then wrote an article exposing Hagrid as a [[half-giant]], and he was so ashamed that he stopped teaching and stopped coming to meals in the [[Great Hall]]. Dumbledore tried to bring him around by visiting his hut, but to no avail. Only after Harry, Ron, and Hermione proved that they still liked and that it did not matter to them that he was half-giant did he finally return to his post.\n\n[[File:Harry Prefect's bathroom 1.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry in the prefect's bathroom working out the clue of the [[Golden egg]]]]\nTo prepare for the second task, Harry was told that he had to open the egg he had won from the dragon, but every time he did, it let out a horrifying screech. His rescue from that particular problem came when Cedric Diggory paid him back with the information that he would figure it out if he were to \"''mull things over in the hot water''\" with the egg. Harry reluctantly followed this advice and decided to take a bath in the [[prefects' bathroom]]. He had an uncomfortable exchange with [[Myrtle Warren|Moaning Myrtle]], and on the way back to the common room, he ran into Professors [[Severus Snape|Snape]] and Moody. The latter informed Harry of [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Barty Crouch Snr]]'s obsession with catching [[Dark Wizard]]s.\n\n=====The Second Task=====\n{{Quote|Harry Potter used Gillyweed to great effect. He returned last, and well outside the time limit of an hour.

Harry's new problem was how he was going to survive underwater for an hour. He got his answer in the form of [[gillyweed]] from [[Dobby]], who had come to work at Hogwarts. The second task took place on [[24 February]]. Harry was able to save Ron, but when he reached him he was shocked to find Hermione, Cho, and [[Gabrielle Delacour]] (Fleur's sister), there as well. After the other hostages were rescued, Harry hung around and saved Gabrielle, as well as Ron. The judges were then informed that Harry reached to hostages first. He was outside the hour that had been allotted, although doing so earned him extra points for \"moral fibre\". After the second task had finished, Harry and Cedric were tied for first, Viktor was in second, and Fleur was in last place.\n\n[[File:B4C27M1 fugitives in the cave near Hogsmeade.png|250px|thumb|left|The trio visiting Sirius in the cave in which he's hiding]]\nAfter Harry was mysteriously entered in the Triwizard Tournament, Sirius hid in a cave near [[Hogsmeade]], where Harry, Ron, and Hermione occasionally visited him, and provided mostly moral support to Harry during this time. Sirius warned him about [[Igor Karkaroff]], the Durmstrang headmaster, telling Harry that Karkaroff used to be a Death Eater and that he gave up a considerable number of names in exchange for his freedom. Harry told Sirius about seeing the name \"Bartemius Crouch\" appear on the [[Marauder's Map]] when he was working on the second clue. Sirius admitted that it was fishy, but told Harry to focus on the task at hand and leave the mystery surrounding Crouch to others.\n\nA month before the final task, the Champions were shown the beginnings of the challenge. Harry and Cedric both expressed horror at the sight of the [[Quidditch pitch]] being turned into the hedge maze, put were quickly reassured by [[Ludovic Bagman|Bagman]] that it would be put right after the Tournament. They were told the third and final task was going into a maze filled with obstacles to find the [[Triwizard Cup]]. On the way back to the [[Hogwarts Castle|castle]], Krum took Harry aside to ask him something. Thinking that this was something important, Harry went with him.\n\n[[File:B4C28M1 Hermione opening hate mails.jpg|250px|thumb|Hermione receives hate mail from in response to Skeeter's article about her and Harry]]\nKrum then asked Harry about his relationship with Hermione, in whom Krum was deeply interested. Harry told him that there was nothing between him and Hermione and that she was just a friend. He also told Krum not to believe anything [[Rita Skeeter]], who had recently written in ''[[Witch Weekly]]'' that there was a Harry-Hermione-Krum love triangle, wrote about him. This supposed love triangle also led to Hermione receiving numerous amounts of hate mail. At that moment, Barty Crouch Snr appeared in the forest disoriented and asking for Dumbledore. He disappeared when Harry went to fetch Dumbledore.\n\n=====The Dream and the Pensieve=====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Albus Dumbledore|I have a theory, no more than that... It is my belief that your scar hurts both when Lord Voldemort is near you, and when he is feeling a particularity strong surge of hatred.|Harry|But... why?|Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed.

Harry awoke with his scar badly hurting and pretended he needed to go to the hospital wing, he actually went to see [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]. Once in the headmaster's office, Harry overheard an argument between Dumbledore, [[Alastor Moody|Moody]], and [[Cornelius Fudge]], regarding the Barty Crouch situation: Fudge refused to believe the words that Crouch said about [[Bertha Jorkins]] being dead and, while debating what had happened to Crouch, Fudge suggested that [[Olympe Maxime|Madame Maxime]] was the likely culprit given her half-giant physiology. Dumbledore then accused the Minister of acting on personal prejudice, which he ignored due to Dumbledore's friendship with [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]. Moody interrupted the debate to explain that Harry had arrived.\n\n[[File:B4C30M1 Wizengamot trial Pensieve memory.png|250px|thumb|Harry witnessing the trial of the Lestranges and Barty Crouch Jnr, through the pensieve]]\nHarry was left alone in the office after Dumbledore, Fudge, and Moody left to examine the school grounds. While looking around, Harry noticed Dumbledore's [[Pensieve]]. Through curiosity, Harry peered in and ended up looking into three of Dumbledore's memories, from the days immediately after the end of the [[First Wizarding War]]. The first was the trial of [[Igor Karkaroff]], in which he renounced his support of the [[Death Eaters]] and gave the names of existing Death Eaters, including Snape. Dumbledore (in the memory) stated that Snape had defected the Death Eaters and was a spy against Voldemort and no longer a threat. The second memory showed the trial of [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]], who was accused of passing information to Voldemort, but his popularity quickly cleared him. The third was the trial of the [[Lestrange family|Lestranges]] ([[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], [[Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus]], and [[Rabastan Lestrange|Rabastan]]) and Crouch's son, for the use of the Cruciatus Curse on [[Alice Longbottom|Alice]] and [[Frank Longbottom]]. Crouch sentenced them all to a lifetime in Azkaban.\n\n=====The Third Task=====\n{{Quote|Harry was practising hexes at every available moment. He felt more confident about this task than either of the others. Difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly be, Moody was right: Harry had managed to find his way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before now, and this time he had some notice, some chance to prepare himself for what lay ahead, |Preparation for the Third Task|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\nTo prepare for the final task, Harry, Ron, and Hermione used vacant classrooms to practise spells and jinxes. In Divination class between two of these study periods, Harry dozed off dreaming about Voldemort and left the classroom in a disturbing fashion. Rita Skeeter had witnessed this event and she wrote, on [[24 June]], [[1995]], the day of the final task, that Harry was \"''disturbed and dangerous''\". This did nothing to boost Harry's morale, but when he spent the day with [[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Molly Weasley]], they cheered him up. They also came to watch the final task as his substitute family.<ref name=\"GOF31\"/>\n\n[[File:Harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-movie-screencaps.com-13756.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry in the hedge maze with an [[Imperius Curse|Imperiused]] Viktor Krum]]\nHarry successfully navigated the maze with the aid of the Four-Point Spell. He got past both a Blast-Ended-Skrewt and a [[Boggart]] disguised as a [[Dementor]]. Along the way, he heard Fleur scream. Harry rescued Cedric, who had been attacked by an [[Imperius Curse|bewitched]] Krum; Harry managed to stun Krum and send out a signal for Krum to be rescued before he and Cedric moved on. Harry managed to pass a [[sphinx]].<ref name=\"GOF31\"/>\n\nDuring this final event, Harry saved Cedric from a [[Acromantula]] and Cedric being grateful offered Harry the cup. Both Hogwarts champions then showed supreme sportsmanship and cooperation despite the tension brought on by the maze. They agreed to touch the [[Triwizard Cup]] simultaneously, as it would be a Hogwarts victory either way, which would result in tie for first place. Harry and Cedric were unaware that the cup was actually a [[portkey]] and were transported to the graveyard in [[Little Hangleton]].<ref name=\"GOF31\"/>\n\n=====Rebirth of Lord Voldemort=====\n{{Main|Return of Lord Voldemort}}\n{{Quote|He knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason: He was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hide-and-seek; he was not going to die kneeling at Voldemort\u2019s feet... he was going to die upright like his father, and he was going to die trying to defend himself, even if no defence was possible....|Harry stands his ground against Voldemort|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\n[[File:Cedric's Death.gif|250px|thumb|Cedric's murder at the hands of Peter Pettigrew and Lord Voldemort]]\nThis graveyard was the Riddle family's final resting place, where [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] was waiting. Just as Harry and Cedric are trying to figure out what happened, someone appears and Harry's scar begins hurting again. Acting on Voldemort's orders, his servant [[Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]] murdered Cedric with the [[Killing Curse]]. Harry saw a flash of green light and heard Cedric's body hit the graveyard's ground with a thud. Harry is then dragged to a large marble tombstone, with the name Tom Riddle engraved upon were he is bound. From there he was forced to witness a ritual in which Pettigrew used some of Harry's blood to [[Return of Lord Voldemort|restore Voldemort's body]]. The [[Death Eaters]] were summoned to the cemetery.\n\nAfter his Death Eaters arrived, Voldemort spends time criticising them for failing to seek him out during these last thirteen years, even though they knew that he had found a way to escape mortal death. He then rewards Wormtail for aiding with his rebirth by creating a new silver hand for him. The Dark Lord identifies more Death Eaters and reveals that this servant who is at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] has ensured that Harry would win the tournament and be brought to the graveyard. Voldemort then frees the injured and weakened Harry and orders him to face him in a [[Duelling|duel]], wishing to prove who among the two is stronger in front of his minions now that there is no one around to protect Harry.\n\n[[File:Duel_graveyard.gif|250px|thumb|left|Harry duels Voldemort in a battle of wills, triggering the effect of ''[[Reverse Spell|Priori Incantatem]]'']]\nVoldemort then tortured him by subjecting him to the [[Cruciatus Curse]] and used the [[Imperius Curse]], but when it didn't work he tried to murder Harry using the Killing Curse. Harry fired back with the Disarming Charm. The nature of their wands' mystical connection caused their magical streams to interlock, which created an effect called ''Priori Incantatem'' (Reverse Spell effect). Harry and Voldemort then engaged in a battle of will. After Harry was momentarily shielded by the echoes of Lord Voldemort's previous victims, including Harry's parents and Cedric. Cedric's echo asked Harry to return his body to his parents. This bought Harry some time to grab Cedric's body and the [[Portkey]].\n\n=====Exposure of Barty Crouch Jnr=====\n{{Dialogue|Harry|You're mad!|Barty Crouch Jnr|Mad, am I? We'll see!

It was uncovered that Barty Crouch Jnr, who had willingly taken the [[Dark Mark]] as a young man, was throughout the school year disguised as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Alastor Moody. Crouch (disguised as Moody) managed to usher Harry away from the panicking crowd to interrogate him about Voldemort's return. He wanted to murder Harry, but Albus Dumbledore and several other members of the Hogwarts staff arrived to stop him. Under the influence of [[Veritaserum]], Crouch confessed everything.\n\n[[File:B4C36M1 Snape Dark Mark reveal.png|250px|thumb|The Minister for Magic visiting Harry in the hospital wing]]\nIn a terrible turn of fate Crouch's soul was destroyed by the [[Dementor's Kiss]], from the [[Dementor]] that accompanied [[Cornelius Fudge]]. Fudge felt that his personal safety was in jeopardy, hence why he brought the Dementor. As a result, Crouch Jnr could not give testimony and the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] began to dispute Harry's and Dumbledore's insistence that Voldemort had returned. The Minister refused to believe Harry's account of Voldemort's return, even when he was supported by Albus Dumbledore. This was due to Fudge not wanting the peace and tranquillity they worked so hard for to be destabilised by this announcement. The Ministry publicly denied the Dark Lord's return and branded Harry and Dumbledore either liars or nutters in the press. Voldemort and his Death Eaters took advantage of this to operate in secret, while Dumbledore called for a reconstitution of the [[Order of the Phoenix]].\n\n====Fifth year====\n{{Dialogue a-b|Molly Weasley|Watch me.

He suffered constant nightmares and flashbacks. Also his friends, [[Ronald Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] seemed to block him from information and he was blocked entirely from the wizarding world except for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' that said that Harry was wrong. To make things worse than they were already, on [[2 August]] someone (Dolores Umbridge) sent [[Dementor]]s to attack Harry in the Muggle town of [[Little Whinging]], in an attempt to neutralise him. He was forced to perform a [[Patronus Charm]] in order to save Dudley and himself.\n\nAfter Harry explains to the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] about the Dementor's abilities, Vernon blames Harry and is ready to throw Harry out. He had always yearned to do so since the family received Harry, when Petunia receives a [[Howler]]. Before she has an opportunity to open the letter, it bursts into flames and a menacing voice says, \"''Remember my last, Petunia''\". Petunia then immediately convinces her husband to let Harry remain at Privet Drive and tells him that he needs to stay in his room. Harry having no idea of what's going on retreats to his room and proceeds to stay there.\n\n=====Hearing=====\n{{Main|Disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter}}\n[[File:1995 hearing.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry's Hearing for underage magic]]\nSubsequently, Harry was formally accused of performing underage magic in the presence of a Muggle and was expelled, but thanks to Albus Dumbledore's intervention, this was changed to a [[Disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter|disciplinary hearing]] in front of the entire [[Wizengamot]] at the [[Ministry of Magic]] on 12 August. In a further attempt to discredit Harry, the Ministry changed the time and location of the hearing at the last minute, but Harry was able to make it there just minutes late. He was threatened with expulsion from Hogwarts, but was exonerated with help from Dumbledore, who had a witness and legal loopholes to help him.\n\n=====Dolores Umbridge=====\n{{Quote|He let out a gasp of pain.

She was later appointed [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor]], empowered to arbitrarily change and impose school rules whenever she chose. She made numerous rules that the students were expected to follow and if they did not harsh punishments would be enacted. Umbridge proved to be sadistic and cruel, with a personality that resembled poisoned honey.\n\nHarry hated her on sight and she had a deep dislike for him as well. This dislike bordered on hatred and came about because of her inability to control him. Every time Harry spoke out of turn or even mentioned Voldemort, Umbridge threw him into detention. The detentions he had with her were torturous, forcing him to write with a Black Quill. The Black Quill was of her own invention and it made him write with his own blood, scribed the message \"''I must not tell lies''\" onto the back of his hand. Harry had to endure numerous sessions with the quill, so many that the words are now permanently carved into his hand. These detentions however did not sway him from his opinions or make him subservient to Umbridge. They had the opposite effect and strengthen his resolve to stand by his statements of [[Return of Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's return]] .\n\n[[File:Detention_with_Dolores.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry in detention with Umbridge, being forced to use a [[Black Quill]]]]\nHowever, Umbridge presumed the message had failed to sink in, as Harry spread the word through ''[[The Quibbler]]'' about the previous year's events, and thus he was banned from any more [[Hogsmeade]] visits. Also once Umbridge found out that he gave ''The Quibbler'' an exclusive interview she banned the magazine, which caused the whole student body to take an interest in it. Later in the year Ron was chosen to be a [[prefect]], not him. This surprised everyone, as they all believed that Harry would have gotten the badge instead of Ron. It was later revealed that Ron was chosen instead of Harry because [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] thought that Harry had \"''enough responsibility to be going on with''\". Harry's jealousy threatened to affect his friendship with Ron, but he felt better when he discovered that his father was also not chosen as a prefect at school. This suggests that Harry's desire in becoming prefect was to emulate his father, who was [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]] in his day, not to inflate a sense of his own importance.\n\n=====Dumbledore's Army=====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Hermione Granger|No, I agree, we\u2019ve gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books.

I\u2019m talking about ''you'', Harry.|Hermione convincing Harry to teach the legal study group|Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix}}\nBecause Fudge was raked with paranoia and stubbornly believed that Dumbledore was training an army to overthrow him, Umbridge had the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class reduced to reading textbooks. This proved an ineffective teaching method and did nothing to prepare students for what was to come. Hermione proposed the idea that Harry teach the students, as he has previous experience defending himself against the Dark Arts and various monsters.\n\n[[File:B5C16M1.png|250px|thumb|left|The meeting of students in the Hog's Head that would become known as Dumbledore's Army]]\nThe trio held a meeting at the Hog's Head to discuss with other students the possibility of Harry giving them Defence lessons. Harry is stunned at how many there are various [[Gryffindor]]s, [[Ravenclaw]]s, and [[Hufflepuff]]s show up. Although he harboured the suspicion that a few, such as [[Zacharias Smith]], only wanted to hear about the night Cedric Diggory was murdered. After some initial scepticism, the students started to list Harry's achievements: the rescue of the [[Philosopher's Stone]] from a disembodied Voldemort, slaying of Slytherin's [[basilisk]] in the [[Chamber of Secrets]] with the [[Sword of Gryffindor]], ability to produce a corporeal Patronus, and winning of the [[Triwizard Tournament]].\n\n[[File:Tumblr n6unbjelLi1r5w42zo4 250.gif|250px|thumb|Harry instructs [[Neville Longbottom]] and others during a D.A. meeting]]\nGiving into Hermione's persistent urgings Harry secretly trained a group of students in practical defensive magic. In an attempt to make light of the Ministry's fears the group called themselves [[Dumbledore's Army]] (or the D.A.). Aware that arranging meetings and passing the word about them verbally was not a secure method of communication, Hermione bewitched several coins with a [[Protean Charm]] one for each member of the D.A. When activated by Harry, the numbers on each coin would change to inform the bearer of the time and date of the next meeting. Feeling highly anxious and frustrated most of the time Harry found that the D.A. was now his chief source of happiness, and the thing to which he looked forward throughout his school day. This happiness was felt by most members, as all of them (particularly Neville and the [[Creevey family|Creevey]] brothers) gained a lot of skills under Harry's tutelage.\n\n[[File:B5C27M1 Harry Teaching Dumbledores Army Patronus Spell.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry teaching the members of the D.A. the Patronus Charm]]\nHarry taught the group many different spells, ranking from the simplistic [[Disarming Charm]] to the highly advanced Patronus Charm. The class progressed at a fair rate, practising the: [[Impediment Jinx]], [[Reductor Curse]], [[Stunning Spell]], and various other hexes and jinxes before temporarily breaking up for Christmas break. Lessons continued during the early months of 1996, The class mastered the [[Shield Charm]], and began to work on the Patronus Charm. Some members were even able to produce corporeal Patronuses, Harry thought this might have been due to the lack of [[Dementor]]s present, as there was nothing to make the students scared.\n\n=====Occlumency=====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Severus Snape|The [[headmaster]] has sent me to tell you, Potter, that it is his wish for you to study Occlumency this term.|Harry|Study what?|Occlumency, Potter.

During the meetings whenever Harry was near, she would become so flustered that she had difficulty casting spells correctly. Before the [[Christmas]] holidays, she and Harry were discussing how she had never been able to pull of the Stunning Spell before, when the room generated mistletoe. The room did this due to sensing the tension that was present. Under the mistletoe, the two kissed for the first time. This moment was confusing to Harry, as Cho, clearly still suffering from her ex-boyfriend's death, had been crying during their kiss. Cho's crying during the kiss also caused concern in Harry. Harry later informed Hermione and Ron of his disastrous first kiss and Hermione comforted him saying that it was not his kissing that made Cho cry.\n\n[[File:Occlumency lessons OOTPF.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry's first Occlumency lesson with Snape]]\nHowever, Harry took on some much more pressing worries later that night. [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], wanting a \"secret weapon\" against him, had heard of a [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|prophecy]] hidden in the Ministry's [[Department of Mysteries]] concerning both of them. Voldemort had been obsessing over the door to the [[Hall of Prophecy]] for the past few months, and had been inadvertently allowing Harry to read his thoughts through [[Legilimency]]. The link between Harry and Voldemort's minds had been growing stronger for quite a while. As a result, after falling asleep on the night of his kiss with Cho, Harry witnessed [[Nagini]] [[Attack on Arthur Weasley|attack]] Arthur Weasley in his dream, and felt almost as if he had been the snake. Realising what could happen if the link grew more powerful, Dumbledore commissioned Snape to train Harry in Occlumency in an effort to prevent further problems.\n\nCritically injured, Arthur was taken to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]]. Harry, Ron, Ginny, Fred, and George took a portkey to Grimmauld Place. When they arrive at headquarters, they were greeted by Sirius, who ordered them to stay put and wait for news. Mrs Weasley stated that Arthur survived the attack and was grateful towards Harry. Even though Arthur survived, he was required to take a [[Blood-Replenishing Potion]] at regular intervals. Mr Weasley also shared the ward with a man who had been bitten by a [[werewolf]] and a woman with a massive chunk out of her leg who refused to tell the [[Healer]]s what had bitten her, arousing suspicions she had been handling something illegal.\n\n[[File:Christmas at St Mungo's.png|250px|thumb|The trio and Ginny see Lockhart in the [[Janus Thickey Ward]] for spell damage]]\nHermione joined Harry and the Weasleys at Grimmauld Place for Christmas, and [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] sent back his Weasley jumper, which made his mother cry. Hermione, Ron and Ginny discovered that Neville's parents were insane and living at St Mungo's. They were informed of this by Neville's grandmother, who made it known that Frank and Alice were tortured by Death Eaters for information regarding Voldemort. They also saw their former [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]. Also Harry finally admitted that he knew what happened to Neville's parents.\n\nUnfortunately, Harry did not enjoy having his mind peered into and did not focus on using Occlumency, having indeed been extremely curious about the door himself. During a lesson in Occlumency, Snape stepped out of the room, and Harry's curiosity got the best of him. He looked into the [[Hogwarts Pensieve|pensieve]], which contained Snape's memories, and, to his dismay, Harry found images of his father bullying Snape and of his mother rushing to his defence. Harry found himself siding with his mother, agreeing that James' treatment of [[Severus Snape|Snape]] was wrong and it bordered on being almost cruel.<ref>{{OOTP}}</ref> The conflict escalated to the point where Snape called Lily a \"Mudblood,\" an act that cost him his friendship with her. Snape himself discovered Harry's spying. [[Severus Snape|Snape]] refused to give him any more [[Occlumency]] lessons, something that Harry was not particularly concerned about and something he did not inform anyone of. Uncovering the source behind Snape's hatred for [[James Potter I|James]] left Harry seeing his father in a slightly different light. He also found comfort in the fact that at least his mother appeared to be person of strong morals while wondering why she ever agreed to marry James in the first place.\n\n=====Dumbledore's escape=====\n{{Quote|Dumbledore\u2019s Army, [[Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius]].

While the two did like each other, Cho was mistakenly jealous of [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] due to the latter's closeness with Harry, and Harry still felt awkward about Cho's feelings over Cedric. When Cho's friend, [[Marietta Edgecombe]], betrayed the [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] to Umbridge, the members were all punished and forced to end their meetings. Harry was furious with Marietta but Cho insisted on defending her friend. Cho even claimed that it was not Marietta's fault because she was being pressured by her mother. At this point, Cho's and Harry's relationship \"fell apart\", and the two no longer saw each other romantically. Umbridge is appointed [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] and imposes even tighter control. Fred and George Weasley rebelled against the new authority at the school. On one occasion, the twins released enchanted fireworks through the castle.\n\n[[File:James harry Lily.PNG|250px|thumb|A memory Harry sees featuring [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]] standing up to James Potter]]\nFred and George took it easy during the Easter holidays, but then took their rebellion to a new level. They turned a corridor of the school into a swamp to create a diversion for Harry to access the fireplace in Umbridge's office in an attempt to contact [[Sirius Black|Sirius]], and were cornered by Umbridge and members of the [[Inquisitorial Squad]]. In a final act of defiance, the twins summoned their brooms, openly mocked Umbridge's authority, struck the Squad members with a variety of jinxes, and escaped the school behind to pursue a career in their joke shop, with the money Harry lent them.\n\n=====Careers Advice and Grawp=====\n{{dialogue a-b-a-c-a|Rubeus Hagrid|They were bullyin' him, Hermione, 'cause he's so small!|Hermione Granger|Small?

During this admission they are rudely interrupted several times by [[Umbridge family|Umbridge]]; she remarks against Harry's ambition of becoming an Auror. She stating that applicants can not have a criminal record, these constant interruptions angered McGonagall. The meeting ends with [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]] supporting him, and having a screaming argument with Umbridge.\n\n[[File:Hagrid introduces the trio to Grawp.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hagrid introducing Harry and Hermione to the sixteen foot giant [[Grawp]]]]\nDuring the final Quidditch match of the year \u2014 in which Harry did not play as Umbridge had banned him for life \u2014 [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], who had returned to the school months into the term and very badly beaten, decided to show Harry and Hermione why he was so badly injured. This caused them to miss much of [[Gryffindor]]'s Quidditch match. Hagrid also relayed to the trio were he had been during those months that he was away. He along with [[Olympe Maxime|Madam Maxime]] were given a mission to the Giant Colony, in order to persuade them to join Dumbledore and his cause. This mission proved to be a failure to the Order, as the giants chose to align with the [[Death Eaters]], due to their shared love of violence and killing.\n\nHagrid had dragged a [[giant]] back with him from his mission over the summer. It transpired that the giant (named Grawp) was Hagrid's half-brother on his mother's side, and that Hagrid had been attempting to civilise the giant, but with few results. He made Harry and Hermione promise that they would look after Grawp, should Hagrid be forced to leave the school for any reason. Hagrid was attacked and left the school during [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] examinations, and thus Harry never had to go down to Grawp in the forest.\n\n=====Skirmish in the Forbidden Forest=====\n{{Dialogue|Neville Longbottom|We were all in the [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] together.

He received a vision of Voldemort torturing Sirius and ordering him to get the prophecy. Harry was prepared to go to the Ministry immediately, but Hermione advised him to check [[Grimmauld Place]] first to see if Sirius was still there. Harry used the [[Floo Network]] in Umbridge's office to peer into Grimmauld Place, where [[Kreacher]] stated that Sirius was gone. Unfortunately, Umbridge caught Harry and his friends in the act.\n\nUmbridge asked Snape to extract information from Harry through the use of [[Veritaserum]], but Snape claimed to have none left in his stocks. Umbridge then resorted to the [[Cruciatus Curse]], revealing that it was she who set the Dementors loose on Harry. Hermione managed to save him by luring Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest. Once in the forest Umbridge attempted to harm Harry and Hermione, but was dragged off by [[centaur]]s for calling them \"''filthy half-breeds! Beasts!''\" and ''\"creatures of near-human intelligence\"''. Harry and Hermione escaped when Grawp stumbled into the centaur camp looking for Hagrid. The trio, along with D.A. members [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], Neville Longbottom, and [[Luna Lovegood]] \u2014 who had assisted in Harry's attempt to contact Grimmauld Place \u2014 used [[Thestral]]s to fly to London.\n\n=====Battle of the Department of Mysteries=====\n{{Main|Battle of the Department of Mysteries}}\n{{Dialogue a-b-c-a-c|Harry Potter|Don\u2019t do anything.

The group became doubtful until they came across a room filled with crystal balls, later to be known as prophecies. One of the prophecies had Harry's name on it, and he picked it up, much to the displeasure of [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]]. Upon picking up the prophecy [[Death Eaters]] appeared, revealing that it was all a ruse to bring him there. Harry then attempts to buy time by fully mocking Voldemort in front of his Death Eaters, which infuriates [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], yet Lucius stops her from hurting Potter, not through defence, but so that they can protect the prophecy. Harry still refuses to hand over the prophecy, so [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]] then begins to tease him that the prophecy holds the answer to his scar, why Voldemort wishes to kill him, and the cause of the Second Wizarding War.\n\n[[File:Sirius and Harry fighting Antonin Dolohov and Lucius Malfoy Death Chamber.gif|250px|thumb|Harry and Sirius duelling Death Eaters Lucius Malfoy and [[Antonin Dolohov]]]]\nJust then, on Harry\u2019s signal, the six D.A. members all use the [[Reductor Curse]] to smash the shelves of prophecies, distracting the Death Eaters so that they could flee. Ron, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]] had taken another path and Harry, Hermione, and Neville did not know where they were. Chaos ensued, Harry's group was chased through various rooms. When in he Death Chamber, all but Harry and Neville were incapacitated in the fighting. Then reinforcements from the Order of the Phoenix, alerted by Snape, arrived to help aid in the battle. In the ensuing fighting, Sirius Black was murdered by a killing curse from his cousin, [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], and fell through a mysterious [[Veil|stone arch]]. Harry pursued Bellatrix, using the Cruciatus Curse, but he was unable to kill her.\n\nVoldemort appeared, angered by the failures of his Death Eaters. For the second time, he attempted to fatally curse Harry, who was too transfixed to even defend himself, but Dumbledore's sudden arrival saved him. Voldemort then fully possessed Harry, hoping that [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] would sacrifice Harry in order to kill Voldemort. However, Voldemort was forced to leave Harry's body when Harry's grief for Sirius became too overwhelming to bear, as Voldemort did not understand the concept of love. Voldemort then grabbed Bellatrix and [[Apparition|Disapparated]], but not before the [[Cornelius Fudge|Minister]] and Ministry employees saw him and finally accepted that he was back.\n\n=====The prophecy=====\n{{Quote|The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches...

Harry was none too pleased about Dumbledore's name being mentioned by the portraits. When the Headmaster returned, Harry lost his temper and started destroying Dumbledore's possessions, trying to get Dumbledore to let him out; Dumbledore refused, asking Harry to sit down and listen to what Dumbledore needed to say.\n\nDumbledore explained to Harry the real reason why Voldemort tried to kill him as an infant. A prophecy stated that he was destined to defeat the [[Dark Wizard|Dark Lord]], for he had powers Voldemort did not: the ability to [[love]], something that the Department of Mysteries was trying to research in a locked room. As a result of the battle, the [[Ministry of Magic]] realised that Lord Voldemort had indeed returned, and Harry and Dumbledore were vindicated along with Sirius (though he didn't live long enough to enjoy his freedom, but was honoured as hero by the Ministry). Serious steps were taken following this change in policy, such as the dismissal of Umbridge. However, this was not a sea of change, as the Ministry still had a mistrust of Dumbledore.\n\n====Sixth year====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Albus Dumbledore|So, Harry.

There, he obsessed and brooded over his godfather's death where he hardly left his room and refused meals. As the battle had taken place at one point in the famed [[Hall of Prophecy]], many in the [[Wizarding world|wizarding community]] including the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' began to speculate about the relationship between Harry and that place, leading to, accidentally correct reports calling Harry \"the Chosen One\", the one destined to defeat Lord Voldemort once and for all. \n\n[[File:DumbledoreSlughornsHouse.jpg|250px|thumb|Dumbledore and Harry searching for [[Horace Slughorn]]]]\nEarly in his summer, Dumbledore requested that Harry join him in some unknown adventure. He arrived to pick Harry up at [[4 Privet Drive]] on a Friday, late in the evening. Harry had not informed his aunt and uncle of this development and it came as a great surprise to them. However, they could not depart immediately, because there was a piece of business to attend to: [[Sirius Black's will|Sirius's will]]. Much to his rage, Harry inherited his godfather Sirius Black's estate. This included: 12 Grimmauld Place, the Black family vault, and the Blacks' irritating and half-crazed house elf, [[Kreacher]]. Harry still retained animosity towards Kreacher after his involvement in Sirius' death a few months previous. He also gave Dumbledore permission to continue to use Grimmauld Place as [[Order of the Phoenix|Order]] headquarters. Afterwards they were off, and Dumbledore [[Apparition|Apparated]] Harry to the small village of [[Budleigh Babberton]], where Harry was introduced to Horace Slughorn.\n\n[[File:Halfblood-00290.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry meets Horace Slughorn, the former Hogwarts [[Potions Master]]]]\nIn their time together, Harry and Slughorn discussed some of the professor's old students and the improved security at Hogwarts. When Harry and Dumbledore made to leave, Slughorn agreed to return to the school if he got a raise and a larger office. Following their visit, Dumbledore dropped Harry off at [[The Burrow]], where Harry spent the rest of the summer playing two-sided [[Quidditch]], but not before informing Harry that he was to be given special lessons by Dumbledore himself.

Harry did not enjoy the experience, and made to leave as soon as he possibly could. Instead of returning to his previous compartment, Harry made to eavesdrop upon [[Draco Malfoy]]. Malfoy's precipitation in meeting weeks earlier had led Harry to believe he had taken the [[Dark Mark]]. What he heard did nothing to dispel his suspicions. \n\n[[File:640x480.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] giving Harry the vial of [[Felix Felicis]]]]\nHarry arrived late to the Welcoming Feast, due to an encounter with Malfoy, in which Malfoy realised he was eavesdropping in his Hogwarts Express compartment under his [[Cloak of Invisibility|invisbility cloak]]. Malfoy froze him with the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] and stomped on his nose, breaking it and leaving him there unconscious, where he soon found by [[Nymphadora Tonks]] who [[Episkey|healed]] his nose and escorted him to the castle. At the feast, Harry was shocked to learn that [[Severus Snape]] had been promoted to Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. While this disappointed Harry greatly, his career as an Auror reopened, as Professor Slughorn would accept his 'Exceeds Expectations' score in Potions. Harry proceeded to take five classes this year: [[Charms (class)|Charms]], [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], [[Herbology]], [[Potions (class)|Potions]], and [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]]. As Harry had not bothered to buy a text book, Slughorn allowed Harry to borrow an old one from the supply cabinet. When Harry examined it, he found that it once had belonged to a student identified only as the \"[[Severus Snape|Half-Blood Prince]]\". The book contained copious handwritten notes that helped Harry excel in Potions for once.

In the first lesson, Dumbledore shows Harry the first of a number of memories he has collected concerning Voldemort's past using his [[pensieve]]. These lessons regarding Riddle's past were in order to learn his secrets and weaknesses. Dumbledore promised Harry that this information would help him survive and would prove crucial to the eventual defeat of Lord Voldemort.\n\n[[File:Harry pensinive.gif|250px|thumb|left|A private lesson with Dumbledore, Harry about to view a [[memory]] in the Pensieve]]\nIn their first lesson the pair delved into the origin of the boy Tom Riddle, by viewing the [[House of Gaunt|Gaunt family]] that once lived around [[Little Hangleton]].

A huge commotion occurs: Morfin attacks Ogden, with Marvolo stoutly defending his son's actions. [[Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo]] also tries to attack his daughter [[Merope Riddle|Merope]] after finding out that she has an intense infatuation with Riddle. \n\nAfter viewing this memory, Dumbledore tells Harry that both Marvolo and Morfin were sentenced to six months and three years imprisonment respectively in [[Azkaban]] due to their behaviour. During this lesson Harry also learned who Tom Riddle's parents were and how they came to be married. He also learned what kind of mindset of the Gaunt family possessed.

Apparently he was over heard talking about the [[Death Eaters]] secret plans while in a pub. Harry believed that Stan most likely knew nothing regarding secret plans, as Stan had a habit of greatly exaggerating. Afterwards Harry, as the new [[Gryffindor]] Quidditch Captain held trials to select the team for the annual Quidditch Cup. Due to Harry's popularity, it proves to be extremely taxing and difficult, with even first-years, [[Ravenclaw]]s and [[Hufflepuff]]s turning up for the trials.\n\nThe first test he administered was a basic flying test, something that proved to be a good idea as it became clear to Harry that most of the students present where not adapt flyers. After an arduous morning of tantrums, foolishness, and many complaints Harry picked the members of his team. The three [[Chaser]]s, one of which was [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] (who out flew all her competition and scored seventeen goals), two [[Beater]]s, and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] as [[Keeper]].

He tried these spells and became increasingly fascinated with the book, going as far as having it on him at all times. This was something that his friends were quick to comment on, stating that \"''all he does is read that bloody book\"'' and that he \"''practically sleeps with it''\".<ref>{{HBP|F}}\n</ref> Harry even considered the book to be almost a friend, a teacher and sort of guide.\n\nHermione disapproved of the book, partly because some of its spells have a dark nature, but mainly because it allows Harry to outperform her in potions. Three times, Slughorn attempts to invite Harry to one of his Slug Club parties, but Harry avoids them. Throughout the autumn, Harry used Quidditch to dodge Professor Slughorn's [[Slug Club]] events, doing this because he disliked the idea and because it was kinder than leaving Ron alone as Hermione had been invited as well.\n\n=====The Opal Necklace=====\n{{Dialogue|Harry|I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, [[Professor]].|Minerva McGonagall|That is a very serious accusation, Potter.

But she (like Ron and Hermione) rubbishes his theory, stating that Malfoy did not go to [[Hogsmeade]] as he had a detention with her, and that there is no proof that he bought the necklace. Harry felt annoyance towards Ron and Hermione, as they did not back him up, but he did not give up on his theory.\n\nHarry's lessons were quite sporadic that autumn, and he did not have another one until after tragedy befell someone at Hogwarts. In this lesson, Harry first sees [[Caractacus Burke]] talking about [[Slytherin's Locket]] which a pregnant and desperate Merope had sold him, her husband having abandoned her when she stopped giving him love potion. Dumbledore then focused on Tom Riddle just as he was on the cusp of his Hogwarts years, and Harry discovered a troubled orphan who consciously used his magic to bully and intimidate the other children. Also Harry shared his suspicions of Malfoy with [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] during their lesson, only to be rebuffed.\n\n[[File:Harry-Potter-Quidditch.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry playing as Seeker in the first match of the season]]\nNot long after that meeting, [[Quidditch]] season was upon them. In preparation for their first game, Harry replaced the injured Katie Bell with [[Dean Thomas]]. The change produced some results, both expected, as the team excelled on the pitch, and unexpected, as Harry found himself in a jealous rage after seeing Dean kissing Ginny after practice. The team's only problem was Ron, who was suffering from a lack of confidence. In an attempt to boost Ron's confidence, Harry blatantly acted as if he had spiked Ron's pumpkin juice with [[Felix Felicis]]. Ron took the bait and played a flawless match; however, Hermione took the bait as well and acted unkindly toward Ron and Harry. While she made up with Harry when he told her of the ruse, Ron's sudden relationship with [[Lavender Brown]] led to continued strife, as it spiked jealousy in Hermione.\n\n=====A Frosty Christmas=====\n{{Dialogue|Rufus Scrimgeour|Dumbledore's man through and through, aren't you, Potter?|Harry|Yeah, I am. Glad we straightened that out.|Harry's refusal to be used by the Ministry|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\nWhile Harry attempted to reconcile his best friends, the Christmas holidays were fast approaching and with them the [[Slug Club Christmas party]] out of which Harry could not wrangle. Since \"the Chosen One\" rumours had been printed, Harry had received an unnatural amount of attention from the young ladies at Hogwarts. Specifically a fourth year named [[Romilda Vane]], who's attention bordered on obsession. As Harry could not ask Ginny to the party, he was left to ask [[Luna Lovegood]] to attend with him as a friend. This made Luna extremely happy and hugely disappointed the gaggles of giggling girls who awaited Harry below every doorway with mistletoe, they gave him resentful looks.\n\n[[File:Harry_in_Hallway.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry overhears a strange conversation between [[Draco Malfoy]] and [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]]]\nAt the party, Harry was surprised to learn that Hermione attended with [[Cormac McLaggen]], a large [[Gryffindor]] seventh year whom Ron despised. Hermione confessed that she did this solely on the fact that fact that it would annoy Ron the most. He told her that it served her right when McLaggen was less than gentlemanly, only talking about himself and Quidditch. Harry was then forced to endure a conversation with both Snape and Slughorn in regards to his potion making skills and his future career choice. Later, after Malfoy was apprehended \"gate-crashing\" the party by [[Argus Filch|Filch]], Harry learned that Malfoy was indeed up to something. He also learned that Professor Snape had made the [[Unbreakable Vow]] with [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]] in order to protect him.\n\n[[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-christmas at the Burrow.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry discussing the overheard conversation between Snape and Malfoy during [[Christmas]] holidays]]\nHarry's Christmas was less than enjoyable, as he was cornered by the new [[Minister for Magic]], [[Rufus Scrimgeour]]. Scrimgeour had been hoping to speak with Harry for months and used [[Percy Weasley]] as his in. The Minister interrupted the [[Weasley family]] Christmas. He tried pitching Harry on becoming the Ministry's mascot, an idea that Harry was not prepared to accept. During the meeting Harry proceeded to tell the Scrimgeour why he would not offer the Ministry his support. The main reasons for his lack of support being: the Ministry's ineffectiveness in dealing with the Death Eater threat, the knowledge that [[Dolores Umbridge]] still held a position within the Ministry, the Ministry's refusal to come to his aid when he tried to inform the wizarding community of Voldemort's return the following year, and the mere fact that Harry had no desire to be used. This discussion left Harry and Scrimgeour on increasingly bad terms.\n\n=====Poisoned mead=====\n{{Quote|Half our family does seem to owe you their lives, now I stop and think about it... well, all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the [[Weasley family|Weasleys]] when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry.|[[Arthur Weasley]] expressing his gratitude|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\nUpon returning to Hogwarts, Harry's sporadic lessons with Dumbledore continued. Early in January, Harry delved into a memory that all but proved that Riddle had murdered his own paternal family after his fifth year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Then Dumbledore showed Harry a most curious memory, a memory that Professor Slughorn had apparently tampered with, and he gave Harry his first homework assignment: to get the real memory from Slughorn. After impressing Slughorn using a [[bezoar]] in class, Harry tried the direct approach only to be instantly shot down.\n\n[[File:Harry Potter saving a poisoned Ronald Weasley.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry saving Ron, after the latter ingested poisoned mead]]\nBy [[1 March]], Harry had still not acquired Slughorn's true memory and had begun to grow more obsessed with Draco Malfoy. That morning he awoke to find Ron under the influence of a very powerful [[Love Potion]], and he took him to Slughorn, only for Ron to end up [[Plot to assassinate Albus Dumbledore|poisoned]]. Harry managed to act quickly and save him with a Bezoar. This was enough for Hermione to overcome her animosity toward Ron, and the three became friends again. Ron survived, but was not fit for the upcoming Quidditch match, so he was replaced by McLaggen. This turned out to be a bad choice, as McLaggen accidentally knocked Harry unconscious mid-match. Upon his recovery, Harry had yet another lesson with the Headmaster.\n\n=====One funeral, two memories=====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Harry|But you won't help her son. [[Lily J.

However, Harry still could not figure out how to obtain the memory and focused on Malfoy. His interest was bordering on obsession. It was Ron who came up with the solution to Harry's dilemma with Slughorn. He suggested Felix Felicis, liquid luck. In the evening, Harry took the potion and not only managed to obtain the memory, but also solved many of his and his friends's problems, including breaking up not only Ginny Weasley and Dean Thomas, but also Ron and his overly clingy girlfriend Lavender Brown.\n\n[[File:Half-blood lessons.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry and Dumbledore prepare to witness Slughorn's true memory]]\nEven though it was after midnight, Harry immediately went to Dumbledore with the new memory. It confirmed Dumbledore's theory that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had created not one but multiple Dark magical objects called Horcruxes to ensure his [[immortality]]. Together, they theorised that the Dark Lord had created Horcruxes out of special objects such as [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|Riddle's diary]] and Slytherin's locket. Before Harry left, Dumbledore promised to let Harry join him if he found another Horcrux. With the memory found, Harry had only Quidditch and Malfoy on his mind.\n\n=====Sectumsempra=====\n{{Quote|Harry looked around; there was Ginny running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him.

She states that someone [[Imperius Curse|Imperiused]] her in the girl's bathroom at The Three Broomstick. In the week before the final Quidditch match, Harry discovered Malfoy crying in the toilet and a duel ensued. With Malfoy on the verge of using an [[Unforgivable Curses|Unforgivable Curse]], Harry cast ''[[Sectumsempra]]'', a curse with unknown effects that he found in the [[Severus Snape's copy of Advanced Potion-Making|Half-Blood Prince's book]]. The curse nearly killed Malfoy and earning Harry indefinite Saturday detentions with Snape and a telling off from McGonagall.\n\n[[File:Harry&Ginny.gif|250px|left|frame|Harry and Ginny kiss for the first time, thus beginning their [[love|romantic]] relationship]]\nUnable to play in the final match, Harry waited with anticipation as he sat through his first detention. When the dentition was finally over he arrived back at [[Gryffindor Tower]] and was happy to discover that the team had won the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]] without him. Harry having learned previously that Ginny and Dean had split up and having come to terms with his feelings, was still unwilling to ask her out, fearing Ron's reaction. So in the heat of the moment he spontaneously kissed Ginny while over fifty people watched, about whom he had been thinking quite often. He kissed her after she embraced him in the post-match elation; this marked the beginning of their relationship.\n\n=====Skirmish in the Horcrux Cave=====\n{{Main|Second skirmish at the Horcrux cave}}\n{{Dialogue a-b|Albus Dumbledore|If I tell to to leave me and save yourself, you will do as I tell you|Harry|Yes, Sir.|Dumbledore makes a request of Harry|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\nOn [[30 June]], Dumbledore led Harry out of the castle in search of a [[Horcrux]]. Before they left, Dumbledore made Harry swear to obey any order given him, regardless of his feelings about said order. From [[Hogsmeade]], they Apparated to a [[The Cave|sea-side cave]], where Tom Riddle had traumatised two young children from his orphanage in his youth. Once inside, Dumbledore attempted to locate the Horcrux's second line of defence. He spoke in a whispered tongue and found a hidden doorway which only opened when it received an offering of blood. The cave was difficult to enter with a toll paid in blood, and to get to the island in the centre of the cave there was only a small boat.\n\n[[File:Harry and Dumbledore in the cave.png|250px|thumb|Dumbledore and Harry arrive in the the [[The Cave|Crystal Cave]]]]\nThey next found themselves in a vast chamber containing an underground lake, with a solitary island at its centre from which a faint green light was visible. After a failed attempt by Harry at [[Summoning Charm|Summoning]] the Horcrux, Dumbledore located a carefully concealed boat that would allow them safe passage across the lake. During the crossing, Harry learned another of the Horcrux's lines of defence. The lake was filled with [[Inferius|Inferi]] (animated corpses of Voldemort's previous victims) which would attack anyone who touched the lake's water. Dumbledore instructed Harry on the use of fire as the weapon of choice against the Inferi, should it become necessary. Inferi fear both light and warmth. The thought of the Inferi hidden below caused Harry unease, but was quickly reassured by Dumbledore.\n\n[[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-movie-green potion.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry forcing Dumbledore to continue drinking the emerald potion within the stone basin]]\nOnce on the island, Dumbledore found a stone basin from which he could not remove the [[Horcrux]], without drinking the [[Emerald Potion]] that the Horcrux resided in. Harry was reluctant that either one of them drink it, as they did not know its effects, but there was no way to avoid it. Dumbledore extracted a promise from Harry that he would force him to drink, no matter how much he tried to persuade him not to. With this promise, Dumbledore drank and Harry watched as Dumbledore was driven out of his mind, but upheld his promise.\n\nDumbledore drank and experienced intense stomach pains, dehydration and saw visions that mentally tortured him. Harry later thought that Dumbledore saw the duel between him, [[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]], and [[Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]]. Harry managed to get the potion down Dumbledore's throat. When they finally finished the potion, Dumbledore fell unconscious. When he was revived by Harry he asked for water. Harry attempted to conjure water for Dumbledore with a [[Water-Making Spell|Water-Making Charm]], but this proved ineffective as the water disappeared before Dumbledore could drink it. This being another defence designed by Voldemort. In desperation Harry filled a cup with water from the lake, triggering the army of Inferi that were waiting below.\n\n[[File:Harry inferi.gif|250px|thumb|Harry is overwhelmed by Voldemort's army of [[Inferius|Inferi]]]]\nAs he splashed the water on Dumbledore's face, Harry felt something ice cold on his arm and saw a disgusting hand and the Inferi climbing up from the lake. Harry panicked and attempted to fight back with a multitude of spells and curses, including [[Impediment Jinx|''Impedimenta'']] and ''[[Sectumsempra]]''. None of the spells worked, since the Inferi were too numerous and could not feel pain. He was overwhelmed and dragged under.\n\nDumbledore, having regained consciousness, created a [[Firestorm|ring of fire]] around them that repelled the Inferi. He pocketed the Locket and drove the Inferi back into the lake while he and Harry escaped in the boat. Harry then proceeded to [[Apparition|Apparate]] them back to [[Hogsmeade]].\n\n=====Battle of the Astronomy Tower=====\n{{Main|Battle of the Astronomy Tower}}\n{{Quote|The lightning-struck tower. Calamity. Disaster. Coming nearer all the time.|Prediction of the battle|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\n[[File:Dumbledore defeated.png|250px|thumb|left|Harry witnesses Albus Dumbledore's death at the hands of [[Severus Snape]]]]\nAfter a short broomstick ride through the village they landed atop the [[Astronomy Tower]]. Once on the tower they discovered that Hogwarts had been invaded by [[Death Eaters]], but Harry's friends Ron, Hermione, [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]], [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]], and Ginny, who had been ordered by Harry to watch the school lest Malfoy accomplish his nefarious goal. The D.A. members battled alongside the [[Order of the Phoenix]], on the floor below Harry and Dumbledore, with some help from the remainder of Harry's vial of Felix Felicis. Dumbledore had stopped Harry from fighting and frozen him against a wall with a [[Full Body-Bind Curse]], hidden underneath his [[invisibility cloak]], so all he could do was helplessly watch and wait. While waiting Harry witnessed the death of Albus Dumbledore at the hands of Severus Snape.\n\nDumbledore's body plummeted from the tallest tower at Hogwarts. With Dumbledore dead, Harry was free of the spell that petrified him. He immediately set off after Snape, petrifying a Death Eater and seeking revenge. As the Death Eaters made their way out of Hogwarts Castle and on to the grounds, trying to reach the border where they would be able to [[Apparition|Apparate]] again, Harry pursued and faced off against Snape. Harry tried many times to defeat Snape, even weakly attempting the [[Cruciatus Curse]] and Snape's own hand crafted spells, all with no effect. In the process, Snape identified himself as the Half-Blood Prince, and escaped Hogwarts with [[Draco Malfoy]] and the other Death Eaters.\n\n[[File:Harry and Dumbledore.png|250px|thumb|Harry kneeling net to the body of the recently deceased [[Albus Dumbledore]]]]\n[[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] found Harry and together they managed to extinguish the fire that burnt Hagrid's hut (caused by [[Thorfinn Rowle]]) with the Water-Making Charm. Harry then told Hagrid that \"''Snape killed Dumbledore''\", but Hagrid refused to believe him. Harry and Hagrid returned to the castle to find people staring at Dumbledore's crippled and lifeless body. Harry moved forward the base of the Astronomy Tower and found his mentor's body lying still upon the ground and Hagrid finally believed him. Harry proceeded to stay next to Dumbledore's body thinking that everything that previously happened that night had been all for naught. Harry started crying over Dumbledore\u2019s corpse as well as straightening his half-moon spectacles upon his crooked nose and Harry wiping a trickle of blood from the dead Headmaster\u2019s mouth with his (Harry\u2019s) own sleeve. Hagrid tried many times to get Harry to move, but did not succeed. It was only when he was comforted by Ginny that Harry finally consented to move.\n\n[[File:RAB note.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry and Hermione read the note from Regulus Black inside the fake locket]]\nHarry remembering the locket, took it from Dumbledore's robes. He was absolutely beside himself when he learned it was just a plain bit of jewellery. It was in fact a decoy; there was a note inside the locket that revealed the real Horcrux was taken by someone called '[[Regulus Black|R.A.B.]]'. It appeared to Harry that Dumbledore had died in vain and that they had achieved nothing that night. Harry was still processing this information while Ginny escorted him to the [[Hospital Wing]] on [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]]'s orders, all the while holding his hand as means of comfort. Later at the end of the year, Harry would inform Hermione and Ron of the decoy locket.\n\nOnce in the Hospital Wing he found a injured Neville apparently asleep in bed, as well as: Ron, Hermione, Luna, [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], [[Remus Lupin|Lupin]], [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]], and Ron's brother [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley.]] At some point during the battle Bill had been horribly scarred by [[Fenrir Greyback]]. When Ginny announced that Dumbledore was dead, everyone appeared horrified. Lupin actually lost control for a moment, while Madam Pomfrey burst into tears and McGonagall was weak-kneed. Harry explained to everyone what had happened on the Astronomy Tower and when he was finished, they were all shocked by what he had said. Harry also revealed Dumbledore's apparent reasons for trusting Snape and allowing him a second chance.\n\n=====Funeral of Albus Dumbledore=====\n{{Quote|And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that the [[phoenix]] had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world... had left Harry.|Fawkes leaving represents Dumbledore's departure|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\nAfter leaving the hospital wing McGonagall questions Harry about what he and Dumbledore were doing, but Harry under orders from Dumbledore not to tell anyone except [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], refuses. The teachers then discuss the future of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], and plans for Dumbledore's funeral. Harry turns his back on the Half-Blood Prince's book, and regrets ever possessing it. Hermione and Ron comfort him, stating that nothing in the book ever indicated that he was capable of murder.\n\n{{Main|Funeral of Albus Dumbledore}}\n[[File:B6C30M1 funeral of Albus Dumbledore.png|250px|thumb|Harry attending Dumbledore's funeral (left side, sixth row)]]\nFollowing the death of Albus Dumbledore, his [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|funeral]] was carried out. Harry was disgusted to see that [[Dolores Umbridge]] and [[Rita Skeeter]] had the nerve to attend his funeral, but he did not want to make a scene at Dumbledore's funeral and bit his tongue. Knowing that he would have to [[Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter's Horcrux Hunt|hunt down]] Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es and, fearing for her safety, Harry took Ginny aside, and broke off their romance. Ginny told him that she did not care about the danger of being his girlfriend, but Harry still thought it was best if the two stopped seeing each other. He then spoke to Ron and Hermione, who committed to forgoing their final year at Hogwarts in order to accompany him, despite his protests.\n\n===Horcrux hunt {{C|1997\u20131998}}===\n{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione Granger|You said to us once before that there was time to turn back if we wanted to.

With four Horcruxes remaining (plus the unknown soul fragment residing inside Harry) the [[trio]] made plans.\n\nHarry, Hermione, and Ron all remained committed to their goal to locate and destroy [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s [[Horcrux]]es. To protect their families Hermione altered her parents' memories so that they forgot they had a daughter, then instructed them to move to Australia, and with some help from Fred, George, and their father, Ron transfigured the [[Weasley family ghoul|family ghoul]] to resemble himself with [[Spattergroit]]. Harry's [[Petunia Dursley|aunt]] and [[Vernon Dursley|uncle]] were taken into hiding by several members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], such as [[Dedalus Diggle]] and [[Hestia Jones]], despite many misgivings on the part of the Dursleys.\n\n====Battle of the Seven Potters====\n{{Main|Battle of the Seven Potters}}\n{{Dialogue a-b-c|Hermione Granger|I told them you'd take it like this.|Harry|If you think I'm going to let six people risk their lives \u2014 !|Ron Weasley |\u2014 because it's the first time for all of us.|The trio arguing over the seven Potters plan|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\n[[File:Seven-potters.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The seven Potters]]\nHarry stayed at [[4 Privet Drive]] for a time, but the Order of the Phoenix needed to evacuate him to the Burrow before he turned seventeen. On [[27 July]] the Order sent the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] into hiding first. Harry was surprised by [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]]'s gratitude towards him for saving his soul and his sincere goodbye. Six out of thirteen of Harry's escorts took [[Polyjuice Potion]] to take on Harry's appearance in order to be diversions if they were attacked, despite Harry's protests. Harry also secretly thought that he wished they would respect his body more. Upon leaving, the group was attacked by over thirty cloaked [[Death Eaters]]. Harry rode with [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] on his godfather [[Sirius Black's motorbike|Sirius' old motorbike]], that had been modified. They were attacked by multiple Death Eaters, including an Imperiused [[Stanley Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]] and eventually Lord Voldemort himself, who had invented and mastered [[unsupported flight]].\n\n[[File:Battle of the Seven Potters.gif|250px|thumb|left|[[Harry Potter's wand|Harry's wand]] retaliated automatically against Voldemort during the battle]]\nHarry's owl [[Hedwig]] was hit by a stray [[Killing Curse]] a Death Eater sent Harry's way. When [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] caught up with them, Harry thought this was the end, but his wand acted on its own to strike out at the man who was both \"''kin and mortal enemy''\", destroying Voldemort's borrowed wand. The chaos ended when Harry and Hagrid passed the protective enchantments placed over the house of [[Nymphadora Tonks]]' parents, although Harry was still completely grief-stricken over the death of his beloved owl. After finding Hagrid safe and sound, the pair took a [[Portkey]] to the Burrow, where he found a worried [[Molly Weasley|Molly]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] standing watch outside in the darkness.\n\n[[File:After the battle of 7 potters.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry and others safely at [[the Burrow]] after participating in the sky battle earlier that night]]\nHarry was relieved to see that Hermione and Ron were fine, but was shocked when [[Remus Lupin]] arrived with [[George Weasley]], who had lost an ear. Everyone else arrived safely, but [[Alastor Moody]] who had been murdered by Voldemort and [[Mundungus Fletcher]], who had [[Apparition|Disapparated]] as soon as the fight started. Many amongst those gathered at the Burrow believed that they had been betrayed, but Harry refused to believe any of those he loved would sell him to Voldemort, much to the chagrin of Remus Lupin.

They used polyjuice potion and the hairs of a red-haired Muggle boy from the village to disguise him. During the party, Harry met Luna Lovegood's father, Xenophilius, (who wore a necklace bearing an Triangle-Eyed symbol) and Viktor Krum, (who dislikes the symbol for it is synonymous with the dark wizard Grindelwald, who attended Krum's school, Durmstrang).

The locket had a negative influence on all of them, straining relations and causing them to all act moody and inclined to get into petty arguments. They overheard a [[goblin]] saying that the sword protected by [[Severus Snape|Snape]] was a fake. They learned that the [[Sword of Gryffindor]] in Snape's office was a copy of the real sword, and that they would have to trace the location of the real sword.\n\n[[File:Harry ron fight.gif|250px|thumb|left|Harry and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] row before Ron abandons the hunt]]\nHarry and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] were excited at knowing what object they could use to destroy Horcruxes, but the locket's negative energy pushed Ron over the edge. Knowing that they now had something they were not close to destroying, Ron and Harry got into a horrible row. Ron accused Harry of not knowing what he was doing and not being very concerned when they learned that [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] had been punished for attempting to steal Gryffindor\u2019s sword for them, along with [[Neville Longbottom]] and [[Luna Lovegood]]. Ron then abandoned his friends accusing Hermione of preferring Harry to himself.\n\nRon\u2019s departure left both Harry and Hermione depressed. After some listless time in which they accomplished nothing, they decided to head to [[Godric's Hollow]], as Harry wanted to visit his parents' graves, and Hermione had convinced herself that [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] might have entrusted the Sword of Gryffindor to [[Bathilda Bagshot]], a magical historian who lived there and who had been friendly with the [[Potter family|Potters]] and the [[Dumbledore family|Dumbledores]].\n\n====Attack at Godric's Hollow====\n{{Main|Attack at Godric's Hollow (1997)}}\n{{Dialogue|Hermione Granger|Meanwhile, we went to Godric's Hollow and, let's think, what happened there, Harry?

After seeing the [[Potter memorial|memorial]] dedicated to his parents and himself, Harry and Hermione searched the graveyard for the [[James and Lily Potter's grave|Potters's grave]] and came across the grave of [[Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]] and [[Ariana Dumbledore]] and that of [[Ignotus Peverell]]. Harry was filled with regret that Dumbledore had not shared this connection with him. Upon discovering Harry's parents' grave Hermione called out to him and comforted Harry when he reached the grave. After placing a conjured wreath of flowers on his parents' graves, the two then met [[Bathilda Bagshot]], who motioned for them to follow her into her home. Believing Bathilda wanted to give him Gryffindor's Sword, Harry accompanied her upstairs alone when she indicated that Hermione should stay downstairs.\n\n[[File:NaginiCombat.gif|250px|thumb|left|Nagini attacking Harry in Bathilda Bagshot's cottage]]\nOnce there, she questioned Harry in what he did not realise was [[Parseltongue]], revealing herself to in fact be [[Nagini]], Voldemort's snake. Voldemort had murdered Bathilda and animated her corpse to hide Nagini, who attacked Harry, biting and coiling herself around Harry. [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] raced upstairs and repelled the snake, while Harry's scar burned, alerting him to Voldemort\u2019s approach. The pair managed to [[Apparition|escape]], but Harry was knocked unconscious and such a close call with Voldemort caused the connection to re-open and Harry had a vision of his parents' demise. And in the scuffle, [[Harry Potter's wand|Harry's wand]] was accidentally broken by Hermione's [[Blasting Curse]].\n\n====Ron's return and obtaining the Sword of Gryffindor====\n{{Quote|Ron, stab it, ''STAB IT!'' |Harry and Ron confronting Voldemort's locket Horcrux|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\n[[File:Patronus_doe.gif|250px|thumb|right|Harry being led by a [[Severus Snape|doe Patronus]] to the hiding place of the Sword of Gryffindor]]\nAfter escaping Voldemort, Harry and Hermione camped out in the [[Forest of Dean]], where Hermione healed Nagini\u2019s bite with [[Dittany]]. When they were camped out there, Harry and Hermione read parts of [[Rita Skeeter]]'s biography of Dumbledore, ''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]'' which Hermione had stolen from the home of Bathilda Bagshot. Upon reading, Harry felt betrayed, because [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] had not shared this information with him. Hermione tried to convince Harry that Dumbledore had his best interests at heart, but Harry became quite disillusioned.\n\nA couple nights later, while standing guard outside the tent, Harry was lead by a silver doe Patronus to a frozen pool into which someone had placed the [[Sword of Gryffindor]], which leads Harry to strip to his underwear and jump in the pool. While trying to acquire the sword, the locket attempted to strangle him, but he was rescued by [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], who had returned through the use of his [[Deluminator]].\n\n[[File:Locket destruction.gif|250px|thumb|left|Ron destroying the locket Horcrux with the Sword of Gryffindor]]\nDuring the [[Destruction of Salazar Slytherin's Locket|brief intense skirmish]], the Horcrux created disturbing imagery, as a last line of defence. Ron was showed his deepest fears, such as spiders and telling him that he was the least loved by his mother who craved a daughter. The final taunt was creating apparitions of Harry and Hermione. The naked Harry and Hermione began to kiss passionately angering Ron, who then destroyed the [[Horcrux]] with the sword, casting the two away. As Ron had saved his life, Harry forgave him for leaving and after seeing the Horcrux torture Ron, explained that he had no feelings for [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] beyond that of a sibling. Hermione, who had been inside the tent during the destruction of the Horcrux, was angry with Ron for a longer period.\n\n====Visit to the Lovegood House====\n{{Dialogue a-b-c|Hermione Granger|\u2018There were once three brothers who were travelling along a long, winding road at twilight \u2014 |Ron Weasley |Midnight, our mum always told us.

They asked about a triangular symbol Dumbledore had left them to decipher in the book he bequeathed to Hermione. After learning of the Deathly Hallows, Harry, Ron, and Hermione discovered that Xenophilius summoned [[Death Eaters]] in an attempt to persuade them to return his abducted daughter. The trio [[Ambush at the Lovegood House|escaped]] the Death Eaters when Hermione blasted the floor open to show them Harry, but managed to keep Ron's alibi of being sick at home with [[spattergroit]] intact by covering him with the [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]].\n\n[[File:Harry-potter-deathly-hallows1-harry hermione.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hermione arguing with a listless Harry over his obsession with the Deathly Hallows]]\nHarry soon became obsessed by the [[Deathly Hallows]]. He spent everyday brooding over the possibilities, forgetting about his responsibilities. With Harry's new found obsession with the Hallows, he became more and more withdrawn and listless. He came to believe that the [[Resurrection Stone]] was enclosed within the [[Golden Snitch]] bequeathed to him by Dumbledore. He also surmised that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] was abroad in a search for the [[Elder Wand]]. This obsession troubled his friends, and with the drop in Harry's attentiveness Ron's leadership qualities flourished.\n\n====Skirmish at Malfoy Manor====\n{{Main|Skirmish at Malfoy Manor}}\n{{Quote|You're a lying, you filthy Mudblood, and I know it!

What else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME! ''CRUCIO''!|Overheard parts of Bellatrix's interrogation of Hermione Granger|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\nAfter listening to a broadcast of ''[[Potterwatch]]'' around Easter 1998, Harry determined that Voldemort was seeking the [[Elder Wand]], and accidentally broke the [[Taboo]] on Voldemort's name. Captured by a gang of Snatchers led by [[Fenrir Greyback]], the trio were questioned about who they were. [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] had previously hit Harry in the face with a [[Stinging Jinx|Stinging Hex]] in an attempt to conceal their true identities, but it all amounted to nothing as the Snatchers then found the Sword of Gryffindor. After Greyback and [[Scabior]] realised that they had caught Harry Potter, the trio were taken to [[Malfoy Manor]] in Wiltshire. The Snatchers decided to forgo taking Harry to the Ministry, but instead to Voldemort directly.\n\n[[File:Bellatrix duels Snatchers.gif|250px|thumb|Bellatrix Lestrange incapacitating [[Snatchers]] at Malfoy Manor]]\nWhen [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] learned that Harry had been caught, she immediately sought to summon Voldemort. She planned to do this, until she noticed one of the Snatchers had the Sword of Gryffindor, which was supposed to be in her vault at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]]. From her drastic change in tone of voice and her worries that they would all perish, Harry determined that another Horcrux was hidden there, as well. Bellatrix isolated Hermione for interrogation based on the knowledge that she was [[Muggle-born]], stating that she wished to talk \"girl to girl with her\" and proceeded to brutally torture her with the [[Cruciatus Curse]]. While being tortured Hermione lied, claiming that the Sword was just a copy. Harry convinced [[Griphook]] (a goblin prisoner) to support this story, knowing that Bellatrix would interrogate Griphook next, as she would want a goblin's opinion on the Sword.\n\n[[File:B7C23M1.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Dobby]] dropping the chandelier, allowing the prisoners time to escape]]\nIn panic as Hermione screamed in pain upstairs, and Ron sobbed at hearing her, Harry called out for help \u2014 a cry heard by [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] through a fragment of a two-way mirror in the cellar. Aberforth sent Dobby the house-elf to rescue the prisoners. Harry had him take [[Luna Lovegood]], [[Garrick Ollivander]], and [[Dean Thomas]] to [[Shell Cottage]], while he and Ron went to rescue Hermione. On the way, they had to fight [[Peter Pettigrew]], whose silver hand strangled him to death when he hesitated to hurt Harry, who reminded him that he had once saved his life. A skirmish ensued upstairs, during which Harry took [[Draco Malfoy's wand]] from him, and he and Ron saved Hermione and Griphook with Dobby's assistance.\n\n====Dobby's death====\n{{Dialogue a-b|Harry|[[Dobby]], no, don't die, don't die \u2014|Dobby|Harry...

Harry was initially relieved to realise he had managed to apparate to [[Shell Cottage]] with Ron, Hermione, and Dobby in tow, but was horrified to see the knife protruding from the elf's chest. Harry managed to lie him on the grass, where Dobby collapsed and died in Harry's arms his last words being Harry's name. Luna (whom he saved) told him it was better to close his eyes so he'd be sleeping.\n\nHarry decided that he would not dig [[Dobby's grave]] with magic, opting instead to do so manually, using a shovel. This was his way of both repaying Dobby's bravery and ebbing his own grief, as his time, effort, and sweat went into the grave. As he dug, he got glimpses of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] furiously punishing Bellatrix Lestrange, the Malfoys, and the others that were present in the manor for their failure to keep him in their custody and allowing him and the other prisoners to escape.\n\n[[File:Shell cottage grave.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry in front of Dobby's grave after having dug it without the use of [[magic]]]]\nHarry, his scar now burning temptingly threatening to have Voldemort's thoughts engulf him, was finally able to learn control of denying Voldemort's entry into his mind. He attributed this to his grief and love for Dobby. While digging the grave, more understanding came to Harry. He realised that though the [[Deathly Hallows]] were tempting objects, [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] had tasked him with destroying [[Horcrux]]es. He decided to trust Dumbledore, reaffirming his faith in his mentor. During the [[Funeral of Dobby|funeral]], [[Luna Lovegood]] gave a short eulogy to Dobby, and Harry managed to say his final goodbye to one of his most loyal friends.\n\n====Shell Cottage and Gringotts break-in====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Harry|He can have it after we've used it on all of the [[Horcrux]]es.

During their stay, the trio formed a plan to break into the [[Lestrange Vault]] to obtain the Horcrux within, with the help of [[Griphook]]. Due to the fact that Griphook would only help in exchange for Godric Gryffindor's Sword, Harry decided to word his request so that the handover would not take place until after Harry had used it to dispose of the remaining Horcruxes. Harry also found out information regarding the Elder Wand from [[Garrick Ollivander|Ollivander]]. He learned that his hunch that [[Elder Wand]] was real and that Voldemort was going abroad to search for it was correct. Harry also learned some complex [[wandlore]], such as what happens when a wand's allegiance changes to that of another individual and that a wand's allegiance doesn't necessarily have to change hands through murder, as most (including [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]) believed with regards to the Elder Wand.\n\nAlthough feeling guilty for the deception, Harry knew that the sword was their only known weapon against the Horcruxes. The other residents of Shell Cottage could not fail to notice the trio's behaviour. [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] took Harry aside and advised Harry to be cautious when making deals with Griphook who Harry was increasingly disliking. Around the same time, [[Remus Lupin]] came to Shell Cottage bearing tidings of new birth. He asked Harry to be the godfather of his newborn child, [[Edward Lupin]]. It seemed as if the incident between them at [[12 Grimmauld Place]] had never occurred.\n\n{{Main|Break-In of Gringotts Wizarding Bank (1998)}}\nThe trio and Griphook left Shell Cottage early on the morning of 1 May to break into Gringotts. Hermione disguised herself as notorious Death Eater [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], using [[Polyjuice Potion]]. The goal was to try and fool the goblins at Gringotts into believing that it was really Bellatrix who was entering the vault. The trio had Bellatrix's wand that Harry had captured at Malfoy Manor as further proof for the disguise. Ron was [[Transfiguration|Transfigured]] to look like a foreign wizard named Dragomir Despard, and Harry had Griphook on his shoulders; both were under the Invisibility Cloak.\n\n[[File:Hermione & Ron In Disguise.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hermione impersonating Bellatrix Lestrange (Harry and Griphook under the [[Invisibility cloak]])]]\nTheir plan proceeded reasonably well; Hermione made a convincing Bellatrix, despite a close encounter with a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] named [[Travers]], whose suspicions seemed to be eased and accompanied the group to Gringotts. Two human guards there had [[Probity Probe]]s that detected concealment charms, and Harry used a [[Confundus Charm]] on them to get Hermione passed unchecked. Inside, the Goblins requested Bellatrix's identification. When Hermione hesitated, one nervously said that her wand was sufficient proof, though Hermione claimed it was new. Harry suspected the goblins knew that Bellatrix's wand was stolen and were looking for an impostor.\n\nGriphook told Harry to use the [[Imperius Curse]], he complied and [[Bogrod]] then accepted the wand as being correct. Bogrod requested the [[Clankers]], and then led the trio, Griphook, and Travers into a passageway. The door slammed shut, and Harry sent Travers away to hide. Bogrod, still under the Imperius curse, summoned a cart that descended deep within Gringotts. After many twists and turns, the cart passed through [[Thief's Downfall]], a security waterfall that washed away all illusion charms. When the cart overturned and dumped them out, Hermione and Ron had been reverted to themselves. Griphook believed the other Goblins knew they were impostors, but Harry wanted to continue and cursed Bogrod again.\n\n[[File:Tumblr mibnclbhYQ1qdab59o3 250.gif|250px|thumb|Harry searches for Hufflepuff's Cup inside the [[Lestrange vault|Lestranges' vault]]]]\nThe trio and Griphook found the vault guarded by an aged, half-blind dragon. Griphook subdued it using the Clankers. Hearing pursuit approaching, Harry forced Bogrod to open the vault, which was filled with precious objects. Hermione screamed in pain, and they discovered that the vault's protective charms included the [[Flagrante Curse|Flagrante]] and [[Doubling Charm|Gemino curses]]: the contents would multiply and become searing hot every time something was touched. Harry spotted [[Hufflepuff's Cup]], the Horcrux, but it was out of reach. Hermione levitated Harry by the ankle and he snagged the Cup by using Gryffindor's Sword, as to not be burned by the metal. Meanwhile Hermione, Ron, Griphook, and Bogrod all struggled to stay above the searing-hot rapidly multiplying objects below.\n\n[[File:Ukrainian Ironbelly .png|250px|thumb|left|The trio escaped Gringotts on the back of a half-blind Ukrainian Ironbelly]]\nAs Harry was setting himself down, he dropped both the Sword and the Cup. Griphook grabbed [[Sword of Gryffindor|Gryffindor's Sword]], and flipped Hufflepuff's cup up into the air. Harry caught it, ignoring the searing heat. Borne by a treasure avalanche spilling from the now-opened vault, Griphook ran off with Gryffindor's Sword, yelling that thieves were in the vault. Harry, Hermione, and Ron hurled curses at the Goblin throng. Harry released the [[Ukrainian Ironbelly|half-blind dragon]] and the three jumped on its back. The freed dragon took flight, the three blasting holes into the ceiling for it to fly through as they made their escape.\n\n====[[Battle of Hogwarts]]====\n{{Dialogue a-b|Harry|Dumbledore left the three of us a job, and we weren't supposed to tell \u2014 I mean, he wanted us to do it, just the three of us.|Neville Longbottom|We're his army.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione set out on their final mission to return to the school and obtain the diadem, inadvertently tripping the [[Caterwauling Charm]] upon Apparating to Hogsmeade and thereby alerting the waiting [[Death Eaters]] to their presence. Due to the trio being under the [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility cloak]], however, the Death Eaters resorted to unleashing [[Dementor]]s into the streets to try to force the intruders out of hiding.\n\nHaving no choice, Harry conjured his [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] to protect himself and his friends, automatically giving away their position and confirming their identities (the Death Eaters having been pre-warned that Harry Potter's Patronus took the form of a stag). As Death Eaters began to close in on the still invisible trio, [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] emerged from the [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], hurriedly telling the three to enter his pub. While Harry, Ron, and Hermione did so, Aberforth remained outside, proclaiming to the Death Eaters that it was he who tripped the alarm (by letting his cat out) and conjured the Patronus to ward off the Dementor threat; mockingly contradicting a Death Eater, saying that what he had seen was a goat Patronus rather than a stag. The incensed Death Eaters believed this and retreated.\n\n[[File:D.a. in 1998.gif|250px|thumb|left|[[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] members in the Room of Requirement welcome Harry back on 1 May]]\nAfter Aberforth re-entered his pub and home, he scolded them for coming to Hogsmeade advising them to leave the country. After Harry engaged in a brief and fierce argument with him, he led the grateful trio directly into Hogwarts through a secret entrance behind the portrait of his deceased sister, [[Ariana Dumbledore]]. [[Neville Longbottom]] (acting as their escort) then guided them into the [[Room of Requirement]], where they were enthusiastically greeted by the reconstituted Dumbledore's Army; most of which were beaten and bruised, yet ready to fight the Death Eaters controlling the school. Harry tried to tell them that he, Ron, and Hermione only returned to find something, but Neville contacted other allies with a call to arms. Harry was initially reluctant to allow the others to help, as he had developed trust issues. But in an attempt to be a better man than Dumbledore (whom he feared he was turning into) and after some discussion with Ron and Hermione, he allowed it.\n\n[[File:Deathly-hallows-part2-still07.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry and Luna entering [[Ravenclaw Tower]]]]\nHarry hesitantly asked the room at large if they had ever heard of any sort of legendary artefact belonging to one of the Founders of Hogwarts. [[Luna Lovegood]] then elaborated on the fabled Diadem of Ravenclaw, pronouncing that a statue in Ravenclaw Tower depicted [[Rowena Ravenclaw]] wearing a diadem. Harry, having no idea of what the diadem looked like, was led by Luna to the Ravenclaw Common Room to observe the statue. Here the pair were ambushed by [[Alecto Carrow]] who pressed her Dark Mark immediately upon noticing Harry, summoning Voldemort, before Luna stunned her from under the Invisibility cloak. [[Amycus Carrow]] attempted to force his way through the common room door, designed only to open after the door-knocker's question was correctly answered, by seeking the help of [[Minerva McGonagall]], who easily allowed him entry by solving the door's riddle herself; by that time, Harry had managed to rejoin Luna under the Invisibility cloak.\n\nAmycus (in fear of his master's wrath) suggested framing Alecto's apparently mistaken summoning of the former on the [[Ravenclaw]] students; as he did, he spontaneously devised a lie that made it seem as though the students had forced Alecto to touch her [[Dark Mark]] at wand-point. In her outrage, McGonagall strongly insinuated that Amycus was a coward for proposing such an idea and that she would not allow it. Carrow spat in McGonagall's face in retaliation, utterly enraging Harry who suddenly revealed himself while momentarily casting the [[Cruciatus Curse]] on the surprised Carrow. The curse sent Amycus flying backwards into the wall where he crumpled and fell unconscious. Harry then told McGonagall about the mission Dumbledore had left him, and she offered to hold Voldemort and his invading forces off, buying him the time he needed to search for the [[Horcrux]]. All students of age, the D.A., and the members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] who had arrived to fight prepared themselves for the impending siege. The Battle of Hogwarts began as Voldemort and his army approached the outer boundaries of the school.\n\n[[File:DH2 Minerva Molly suits of armour.gif|250px|thumb|left|McGonagall, Mrs Weasley, and the suits of armour prepare for battle]]\nOn [[2 May]], [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] upon arrival at Hogwarts, demanded that the school turn over Harry, and the Battle of Hogwarts began. Harry realised that the positioning of Alecto Carrow in Ravenclaw Tower confirmed the Horcrux's identity. It was the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. After thinking on it for some seconds, he went to ask the [[Helena Ravenclaw|Grey Lady]] about the diadem. From her information, Harry surmised that the Horcrux had been hidden in the Room of Requirement. Harry, in the meantime, was worried about Hermione and Ron, who seemed to have disappeared. They had gone into the [[Chamber of Secrets]], where Hermione destroyed [[Hufflepuff's Cup|Helga Hufflepuff\u2019s Cup]] with basilisk fangs, which were one of the few weapons able to destroy Horcruxes.\n\n{{Main|Skirmish at the Room of Requirement}}\n[[File:Harry and Draco.png|250px|thumb|The trio escaping from [[Fiendfyre]] that was cast by Vincent Crabbe]]\nThe trio quickly headed for the [[Room of Requirement]] where Harry remembered seeing the Diadem the previous year. However, [[Draco Malfoy]], [[Vincent Crabbe]], and [[Gregory Goyle]] ambushed them. After a skirmish, the entire room was destroyed by the cursed fire Crabbe unleashed but could not control. Harry managed to fly himself and Malfoy out, while Ron and Hermione grabbed Goyle, but Crabbe perished in the flames that also destroyed the diadem. With one Horcrux remaining, Harry, Ron, and Hermione continued their pursuit of [[Nagini]], but before they could go search for it, they witnessed the death of [[Fred Weasley]]. This incensed Ron and Harry, but Hermione reminded them that only they could finish Voldemort and that to obtain the final Horcrux they would have to do their share of fighting.\n\n====Snape's death====\n{{Quote|Finally, the truth. Lying with his face pressed into the dusty carpet of the office where he had once thought he was learning the secrets of victory, Harry understood at last that he was not supposed to survive. His job was to walk calmly into Death's welcoming arms.|Harry comes to the realisation that he must die by Voldemort's hand|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\n[[File:Snape-s-last-minutes-severus-snape-27845931-640-472.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Severus Snape|Snape]]'s last moments, during which he gives Harry his memories]]\nThey fought their way to the [[Shrieking Shack]]. Along the way, Harry witnessed many scenes of horror. On the grounds, Voldemort's [[Dementor]]s were waiting. After having seen so much pain and death, Harry could not summon the happiness required to conjure a [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]]. In fact, Harry welcomed the oblivion that would come with the [[Dementor's Kiss]]. But, after seeing the patronuses conjured by [[Luna Lovegood]], [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], and [[Seamus Finnigan]], Harry summoned the will to conjure his and managed to drive the Dementors away.\n\nOnce the trio arrived at the Shrieking Shack, they witnessed Voldemort order Nagini to kill Snape, as he believed that Snape was preventing him from being the true owner of the [[Elder Wand]]. Dumbledore was the previous owner of the wand, and as Snape killed him, Voldemort believes with Snape's demise, he will finally gain true mastery of the wand. Before he died, Snape gave Harry memories to view in the Pensieve and asked him to look into his eyes. Upon returning to the castle, Harry saw the corpses of [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Nymphadora Tonks]] near Fred's, and he felt devastated. He left his friends behind to use Albus Dumbledore's Pensieve, welcoming the time in another's head to distract him from what was happening in his own.\n\n[[File:Harry Potter DH using Dumbledore's Pensieve.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry using [[Hogwarts Pensieve|Dumbledore's Pensieve]] to view Snape's memories during the one-hour armistice]]\nDuring a one-hour ceasefire, Harry viewed the memories given by a dying Snape, which revealed to him that he had inadvertently been turned into a [[Horcrux]] himself. This occurred when Voldemort attempted to murder him as a baby. Because Lily Potter's loving sacrifice made Voldemort's Killing Curse rebound and a fragment of his soul latched itself onto the only living thing it could find: Harry himself. This led to the awful truth being revelled, that Voldemort had to kill him in order to be rendered [[Immortality|mortal]]. Harry was unwillingly tethering Voldemort to life.\n\nHarry also learned that Snape was, all along, with Dumbledore because he loved [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]], since before they started school. It was clear that Harry's life span had always been determined by how long it took to get rid of the Horcruxes, and that it was an elegant plan not to waste any more lives but to give the tasks to the boy who had already been marked for death, and whose death would not be tragic but simply another blow against [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]. Heavy of heart, Harry courageously slipped off on his own to carry out this dreadful task. He felt ghostly as he strode through the castle's empty halls, feeling as if he was already dead.\n\n====Harry's \"death\"====\nAs Harry passed the [[Great Hall]], he could not see [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], or the other [[Weasley family|Weasleys]], nor [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]]. He felt he would have given anything for one last look at them, but then he thought he would never be able to stop looking. He also came to realise that Luna had become one of his closest and dearest friends. During his way to Voldemort, he saw the corpse of [[Colin Creevey]], who snuck back into the castle to fight despite being underage and remarked that Colin looked \"tiny in death\". Harry in a moments decision told [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] to slay [[Nagini]], if he could, as Ron and Hermione might be too busy to do so. He passed Ginny, who was comforting a small girl, and almost wished she could have seen him, but under the Invisibility cloak, this was impossible. As he passed Hagrid's hut on the Grounds, he emotionally remembered his trips there, particularly rock cakes, Ron vomiting slugs, and baby dragon [[Norberta|Norbert]].\n\n[[File:Tumblr n29413O6t71rzvuwqo4 r1 250.gif|250px|thumb|left|Harry willingly lets Voldemort hit him with the [[Killing Curse]]]]\nHarry then entered the [[Forbidden Forest]], where he managed to open the [[Golden Snitch]], which said on it, \"''I open at the close''\"; and the words to open it were, \"I'm about to die\"; this revealed the [[Resurrection Stone]] contained within. Harry used it to speak to the spirits of his parents, [[Sirius Black]], and Remus Lupin, who gave him comfort and courage before he met Voldemort and offered to shield him from the Dementors. They set off, and the Dementor's chill did not overcome him; his companions acted like Patronuses, and Harry continued deeper in the forest to find Voldemort. As Harry approached the Death Eater camp, he dropped the Resurrection Stone. Harry offered no resistance as Voldemort struck him with the Killing Curse. His last thoughts were of Ginny: her red hair, blazing looks, and the feel of her lips upon his before everything went black.\n\n====The Limbo====\n[[File:Harry and Albus limbo.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry in [[limbo]] speaking with a deceased Albus Dumbledore]]\nHowever, the \"death\" he met was not permanent: the blood Voldemort had taken from Harry to restore his physical form in 1995 still contained the [[Sacrificial protection|Bond of Blood]], anchoring him to life and protecting Harry from Voldemort's curse, and his willingness to die triggered [[Sacrificial protection|protections]] on the people of Hogwarts similar to the protections he received from his mother's sacrifice. Also, since he had part of Voldemort's soul in him, Voldemort's Killing Curse unknowingly destroyed the part of Voldemort's [[soul]], leaving one Horcrux left. Harry entered a state of limbo, where he met the spirit of [[Albus Dumbledore]] and the piece of Voldemort's soul that had just been destroyed. Dumbledore explained everything to Harry saying that he had \"''no more secrets from Harry''\". After reconciling with his mentor, Harry made the choice to return to the physical world rather than go on to the afterlife with Dumbledore.\n\n====Endgame====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Harry|There are no more [[Horcrux]]es.

He was assisted in this by Narcissa Malfoy, who had secretly turned against Voldemort by telling him Harry was dead in order to protect her [[Draco Malfoy|son]], because she knew the only way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts was with the rest of the [[Death Eaters]] in their victory march. Voldemort then triumphantly disgraced Harry's \"dead\" body with the [[Cruciatus Curse]] then forced [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] to carry Harry's body back to Hogwarts, proclaiming Harry dead and demanding surrender. At first, the surviving fighters were heartbroken, especially Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Professor McGonagall. They screamed abuse at the Death Eaters in anger, remaining defiant. Harry's apparent death had spurred the defenders of Hogwarts on.\n\n[[Neville Longbottom]] courageously stood up to Voldemort, and when the latter offered Neville a rank in his Death Eater society, Neville proudly refused and screamed to the high heavens, \"''Dumbledore's Army!''\" Voldemort cast the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]], then Summoned the Sorting Hat and placed it upon Neville's head. After he announced that there would be no houses and that the school colours would be those loyal to [[Salazar Slytherin]], he caused the hat to burst into flames. As Neville cried in pain, a distant uproar came from the direction of the school boundaries. [[Centaur]]s, [[thestral]]s, [[Buckbeak]] the [[hippogriff]], Hagrid's half brother [[Grawp]], and the families of the Hogwarts students who remained to fight, plus the shop and home keepers of Hogsmeade joined the fight with a flourish.\n\n[[File:Hogwarts Big Battle at Hogwarts Moment Pottermore.jpg|250px|thumb|Voldemort gloating over Harry's 'death', Neville slays [[Nagini]], and the second half of the battle breaks out]]\nThis distracted Voldemort and his Death Eaters, and Neville was able to pull off the [[Sorting Hat]], and from its depths he received the [[Sword of Gryffindor]] and sliced off Nagini's head in one swift, fluid motion. Harry slipped away in the ensuing m\u00eal\u00e9e under the Invisibility Cloak. Death Eaters started to fold under sheer weight of numbers as the house-elves in the kitchens joined the battle, with [[Kreacher]] at its front, declaring war against the Dark Lord in the name of brave [[Regulus Black]]. Using his Invisibility Cloak, Harry protected the defenders of Hogwarts from attack, deflecting Voldemort's curses. Soon, only Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange were the only two remaining and fighting, with Voldemort duelling [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]], [[Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]], and Kingsley at once, and Bellatrix duelling [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]], and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]]. Harry was torn between the two until he saw a Killing Curse aimed at Ginny, the latter missing death by a mere inch.\n\nHarry redirected his path to Bellatrix, until being roughly knocked aside by [[Molly Weasley]], who duelled and ultimately killed Bellatrix. Voldemort's fury at the fall of his last, best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb and Harry turned in to see McGonagall, Slughorn, and Kingsley blasted backwards in pain and Voldemort directing his wand at Molly. Harry then cast a [[Shield Charm]] to protect her from Voldemort's wrath, revealing himself for the final duel.\n\n{{Main|Voldemort's Last Stand}}\n[[File:B7C36M2 Voldemort vanquished.png|250px|thumb|left|Harry's final defeat of Lord Voldemort and the end of the Second Wizarding War]]\nUnbeknownst to Voldemort, mastery of the Elder Wand, which he had stolen from Dumbledore's grave, had not been taken from Dumbledore by Snape, but by [[Draco Malfoy]], because Draco had disarmed Dumbledore on the night of his murder, before Snape killed him. Thus, when Harry had disarmed Malfoy in [[Malfoy Manor]] weeks earlier, he had become the true master of the Elder Wand.\n\nWhen Harry and Voldemort faced off for the last time, Harry tried to tell him this and about the other mistakes he had made. Harry also asked him to feel some remorse for his actions, which Voldemort instantly rejected. Voldemort cast the [[Killing Curse]], and Harry countered with the [[Disarming Charm]]. The Elder Wand refused to attack its master, and the Killing Curse rebounded, destroying Voldemort once and for all.\n\n[[File:After battle.gif|250px|thumb|The battle-worn trio the morning after the battle]]\nImmediately, Harry was surrounded by overjoyed fellow fighters; Hermione and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] reached him first, and then Ginny, Neville, and Luna. Victory celebrations began and Harry was an indispensable part of the grief and celebration. \n\nThe trio visited [[Albus Dumbledore's portrait]], and along the way he explained everything to his two best friends. Harry decided to prevent the [[Deathly Hallows]] from ever being reunited again by keeping the [[Cloak of Invisibility]], leaving the [[Resurrection Stone]] where it lay in the Forbidden Forest, and returning the [[Elder Wand]] to Dumbledore's grave, but not before using it to fix his wand.\n\nWhen Voldemort destroyed the piece of his soul residing in Harry, Harry lost the ability to speak [[Parseltongue]].<ref>''[[Wizard of the Month]]'', October 2007</ref> It is possible, however, that he regained the ability later.\n\n===After Hogwarts {{C|1998\u20132006}}===\n{{Quote|Harry and his friends have their own history depicted on Chocolate Frogs cards.|The trio are honoured with their own Chocolate Frog Cards|Accio Quote!}}\n[[File:Potter family1.png|250px|thumb|left|Harry and Ginny Potter with their three children]]\nHarry ensured that [[Severus Snape]]'s portrait was hung in the [[Headmaster's office]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].<ref>[http://www.mugglenet.com/app/news/show/1272 JK Rowling comments at Carnegie Hall]</ref> He also made occasional visits to the school to give lectures to the students on [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]].

They were civil towards each other; however, their schoolboy enmity meant that they were still not friends at this stage.\n\nAlso following the war, he aided in the care of his godson, [[Edward Lupin|Teddy Lupin]], thus fulfilling the role that his own godfather, [[Sirius Black]], never got to play. Harry and Teddy eventually became very close. Harry's children commented that they wanted Teddy to move in with the family, Harry mentioned that Teddy had already been coming to their home for dinner four times a week, and that he was practically living with them as it was.<ref>{{DH}}</ref> The [[Potter family|Potters]] were also thrilled at the idea that Teddy, who was seen snogging [[Victoire Weasley]] (the eldest daughter of [[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur Weasley]]) might officially become a part of their family.\n\n===Career as an Auror {{C|2007\u20132016}}===\n{{Quote|Harry and Ron utterly revolutionised the Auror Department in \u2014 at the Ministry of Magic.

Harry embraced [[Viktor Krum]], who was competing again after being retired for a few years, upon meeting him and introduced him to his sons, James and Albus.<ref name=\"dumbledores-army-reunites\" /> He supported Bulgaria in the match together with the rest of his family (save for Albus) and looked \"emotional\" when Viktor Krum and his team had won the match. While at the game Harry also sported a nasty cut over his right cheekbone, which was a result of his top-secret work for the [[Auror Office]].\n\nOn [[31 July]], [[2014]] Rita Skeeter launched a book at [[Flourish and Blotts]] titled ''Dumbledore's Army: The Dark Side of the Demob'', regarding the lives of the members of Dumbledore's Army. The book according to Rita's description, seemed to focus on the D.A. members \"imperfections\". Harry and Ginny were featured on the front cover, Harry trying to hide their faces behind his hand. Rita also wrote a mostly fictionalised biography about Harry, with an unnamed title.\n\n====Calamity====\n[[File:Potter_family.gif|250px|thumb|left|Harry with his family at King's Cross Station in 2017 escorting his sons to [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters|Platform 9\u00be]]]]\nOn 1 September, 2017 Harry and Ginny took their three children to [[King's Cross Station]] to see James and Albus off to Hogwarts. There, they met Ron and Hermione and their two children, Harry's niece [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and nephew [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]]. When Albus expressed a fear that he might be Sorted into [[Slytherin]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]], Harry told his son that Albus was named after two Hogwarts Headmasters of whom one was a Slytherin and \"''probably the bravest man'' [he] ''ever knew.''\" Harry assured him that his parents would be proud of him regardless of where he was Sorted. He also told him that the [[Sorting Hat]] would take his preferences into consideration, which happened to him when he was being Sorted. This was a secret he had never shared with his other children.\n\nShortly after, Harry was the leader of the members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]], an emergency response team established by the [[International Confederation of Wizards]] with the help of the [[British Ministry of Magic]] to deal with a series of large-scale breaches of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]] known as the [[Calamity]], who pursued a career as an Auror, congratulating those who decided to chose the profession of an Auror for their brilliant choice but warning them that it could either be the best or worst job depending on their abilities. He would introduce to the Aurors the common [[Weakening Hex]] which lowers the damage their enemies cause along with practising duelling in sessions, where although he was able to outmatch them, their valiance allowed them to come out with increased power in their spells. For those pursuing a Profession as Magizoologists, Harry gave them a lesson on maintaining confidence that eventually resulted in him teaching them the [[Bravery Charm]].<ref>{{WU}}</ref>\n\nAfter an article about his work with the Task Force was published in the ''Daily Prophet'', several of Harry's belongings became foundables. Hermione suspected that this had to do with the article.<ref>{{WU}} - Event: Potter's Calamity</ref>\n\n===Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement {{C|2017\u2013}}===\n{{Quote|Love blinds. We have both tried to give our sons, not what they needed, but what we needed. We've been so busy trying to rewrite our own pasts, we've blighted their present.|Harry realising his mistakes in regards to his second son|Harry Potter and the Cursed Child}}\n\n====Rising tensions====\nWhen Harry picked Albus up from [[King's Cross Station|King's Cross]], who had returned from a year at Hogwarts, he was surprised to find Albus distant and colder. This distance was in direct response to the pressure Albus felt regarding Harry's legacy and the expectations that others put on him because of it. Albus and Scorpius Malfoy became fast friends during the year, as they were kindred spirits \u2014 they both carry a burden stemming from their family identity and feel that they are misfits and \u201closers\u201d in comparison with the other students at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Harry did not like this and he questioned why Albus was content to have only the one friend. Their relationship would stay strained for the next couple of years to come.\n\n[[File:Platform farewell.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry seeing James, Lily, and Rose off to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], while Albus stands off to the side]]\nIn [[September]] [[2018]], Harry took Albus to King's Cross again. He was hurt when Albus told him he wanted to be alone. This stemmed from all the pedestrians watching the two, Albus felt as though they were watching the famous Harry Potter and \"his disappointing son\". Harry told him not to be bothered by people looking and thought his friendship with [[Scorpius Malfoy]], the child of his rival, was the reason why Albus wanted nothing to do with him. Harry then demanded Albus sever their friendship, but his son refused.\n\nIn September 2019, Harry took Albus to King's Cross yet again where he gave Albus the permission slip he needed to visit Hogsmeade. Albus destroyed the slip by burning it, stating that he had no wish to go to Hogsmeade and left his father behind. This in turn caused Harry to become angry with him. Their father-son relationship continues to deteriorate, going from bad to worse.\n\nBy late summer of [[2020]], Harry had been made Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]].<ref name=\"CC152\">{{CC|B|1|5}} - \"Go home to your family, Harry, the Hogwarts Express is about to depart for another year\"</ref> After hearing a rumour about an illegal and very powerful [[Time-Turner]], Harry and his team of Aurors raid the Nott residence and confiscate it. The Time-Turner was supposedly made by Nott for Lucius Malfoy, who was paying him for his services. Harry turns over the Time-Turner to Hermione, the Minister for Magic, for safekeeping. While in his office, laden with paperwork he and Hermione spoke about recent activity among Voldemort's former allies and how action must be taken.\n\n====Amos Diggory's request====\n[[File:Harry gives blanket to Albus.png|250px|thumb|left|Harry gifting Albus with his old baby blanket]]\nHarry was later visited at home by [[Amos Diggory]], who had heard he might have the Time-Turner. Whom he supposedly learned this information from is unknown. While Albus and [[Delphini|Delphi Diggory]] (who claimed to be Amos' carer and niece) listened in, Amos demanded Harry go back in time and save Cedric. Amos proceeded to tell Harry that Cedric was more then a spare and that he deserved a chance to life a full life. However, Harry refused due to the implications of intervening greatly with the past, as changing the past can have severe consequences on the future. This caused Amos to react negatively, calling Harry cold. Later that night Harry attempted to reconcile with Albus.\n\nHarry's relationship with Albus had strained increasingly since he had left for Hogwarts. In an effort to mend things, Harry spoke to Albus and tried to give him the old baby blanket he received from his mother [[Lily J. Potter|Lily]]. He did this in the hope a reminder of what happened would make him change his behaviour. This was a significant and sentimental gift on Harry's part, as it was the only physical piece of his mother that he had. When Albus rejected the gift, it led to an argument in which they both expressed the wish that they were not related. Harry regretted what he said, but it was too late to take it back.\n\n[[File:Harry_nightmare.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry's awoken from a nightmare after his [[Harry Potter's scars|scar]] pains him for the first time in many years]]\nHarry began to experience nightmares and pains in his scar, something that he had not experienced since his final defeat of Voldemort. Ginny tried to comfort him and proceeded to ask what was wrong. When Harry explained, they decided to let [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] know. Harry took his scar hurting to be an ominous sign and it left him with many worries concerning his son and the outcome of the future.\n\nHe and Hermione held a public meeting, but the community was not convinced there is a threat, as they were not willing to accept that danger was once again imminent. Draco accused Harry of only wanting his name in the papers and proceeded to storm out of the public meeting. Later on Harry, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], and Draco then learnt that Albus and Scorpius were missing. This prompted Draco to start a duel with Harry, Ginny was quick to interrupt it, before it got out of hand. They had decided to retrieve the Time-Turner and help Amos save Cedric. Ginny concluded Albus ran away after his argument with Harry, and [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] was upset that Scorpius had been pulled into their family issues.\n\n====Searching for Albus Potter====\nAlbus and Scorpius's time-travelling antics created two separate alternate timelines. This was something that could have disastrous effects for everyone. In one, Harry received a dream revealing Albus's location in the [[Forbidden Forest]]. As he and the others searched, Harry came across the centaur [[Bane]]. Bane warned him that a \"dark cloud\" haunted Albus. He took this \"dark cloud\" to mean Scorpius and his doubts regarding his son's friendship with him strengthened even more. He, Ron, and Ginny found the boys just after they return from the past. Scorpius was uninjured, but Albus sustained a broken arm.\n\n[[File:Harry dumbledore's portrait.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry conversing with the portrait of Albus Dumbledore]]\nAlbus was brought to the school's hospital wing, where Harry conversed with a portrait of [[Albus Dumbledore]]. After Harry aired decades of pent-up emotion left over from the horrors of his childhood and Dumbledore reassuring him he did what he though was best for Harry's well being at the time, the portrait advised him to see Albus as he is. Harry demanded that Albus break off his association with Scorpius. He even went so far as to bully Headmistress [[Minerva McGonagall]] into using the [[Marauder's Map]] to keep them apart. This was something that he would not normally do. Harry's worry for his son had intensified so much that it blinded him to the bigger picture.\n\nWhen Albus and Scorpius went time travelling again, Harry and Ginny received a visit from Draco. He and Harry argued about their children, which resulted in a premature wizards' [[Duelling|duel]]. When Ginny intervened and reminded them their children were missing, Draco surprised them by explaining how lonely he was at Hogwarts and how lucky Harry was to have such great friendships.\n\nHarry and Draco finally gained a mutual respect for one another, and looked upon each other as friends. When Draco speaks of the great bond and sacrifices he has made for Scorpius and his late wife, Harry finally realised he was dangerously isolating Albus. They returned to Hogwarts, where Harry apologised to [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] and they attempted to locate the boys, ultimately discovering that they had the Time-Turner.\n\nHowever, in the other timeline, Albus and Scorpius had created a world where Harry had died at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. Fortunately, with the help of the alternate Hermione, Ron and [[Severus Snape]], Scorpius managed to salvage the original timeline and returned both Harry, and Albus to life. Harry visited Albus in his dormitory where despite his anger, he manages to plant the seed for a reconciliation with Albus.\n\n[[File:Harry Albus argue.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry visiting Albus in the [[Hospital Wing]] and the two begin to reconcile]]\nLater, Harry and his friends learn that Albus and Scorpius were missing again and were last seen with Delphi. They went to see Amos to find out what he knows, and found out he had been [[Confundus Charm|Confunded]] by Delphi into believing she was his niece and carer.\n\nSearching the room for clues to find out Delphi's true identity, they stumbled upon a prophecy that, if fulfilled, would enable the return of Voldemort, and realised Delphi's true identity as Voldemort's secret daughter with [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. However, since they did not know where in time Delphi, Albus, and Scorpius were, they could only bide their time and wait.\n\n====Skirmish at St Jerome's Church====\n{{Main|Skirmish at St Jerome's Church}}\nAt home, Harry looked at the blanket he had tried to give Albus. He noticed writing on it, and found out it was a message sent by Albus from the past. He and Ginny noticed the date, being 30 October, 1981 \u2014 one day before the night that [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] murdered Harry's parents. They alerted Ron and Hermione. Draco, who joined in, secretly revealed to them that his family had a Time-Turner that would be more potent and valuable than the one seized by the Ministry, which was merely a prototype and thus not as desirable to a true [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]].\n\n[[File:Potterplay.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry, Ron, Draco, and others travelling back in time to assist Albus and Scorpius]]\nThey travelled back in time to join Albus and Scorpius. However, under Ginny's prodding, they realised that Delphi did not to want to kill baby Harry, but rather to stop Voldemort from doing so in the hope he would live and his reign would continue. Delphi thought she could make her father stronger as he would know love when he met her, which its lacking was what had originally led to his downfall.\n\nEveryone agreed they had to [[Transfiguration|transfigure]] Harry to look like Voldemort in the hope that they could fool Delphi and hinder her in saving the real Voldemort. They picked Harry because he not only knew Voldemort well through the connection they shared when he was a Horcrux, but he now also understood Parseltongue again.\n\nDelphi pleaded with her \"father\" to recognise her, which Harry managed before the transfiguration spell came undone. However, when Delphi sees she had been set up, she engaged in a fierce duel with Harry, who is later joined by his friends and Albus. They managed to subdue her and she pleaded that she only wants to know her father. A surprised Harry explained that this would not be possible; they cannot change the past.\n\nUpon hearing the real Voldemort arrive to kill Harry's parents, Delphi tried calling out to him, but Hermione and Malfoy silenced her and sent her back to present day. Harry decided to watch the scene of his parents' murder once more, with Albus by his side, to provide a sense of closure for them. They later returned to the present when a devastated [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] arrived at the scene to bring Harry to the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]].\n\n====Visiting the dead====\nBack at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], Albus is asked by Harry to join him one afternoon for a hike up a steep hill. Harry revealed that he had brought Albus to Cedric Diggory's grave, which he regularly visits so he could apologise for his role in his death.\n\n==Physical appearance==\n{{Quote|Harry has his father's and mother's good looks.|[[J. K. Rowling]] comments on Harry's appearance|Accio Quote!}}\n[[File:Harry-potter-and-the-sorcerers-stone1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Harry in his [[first year]], age 11]]\nHarry was a near-spitting image of [[James Potter I|his father]], having inherited his untidy jet-black hair. However, his almond-shaped startlingly green eyes were identical to those of [[Lily J. Potter|his mother]]. This strong resemblance was often remarked on by those who had known his parents.  \n\nHarry's physique as a boy was described as \"small and skinny\", with a thin face and knobbly knees. This skinniness was due to his poor quality of life in his childhood. Despite the neglect he suffered, Harry seems to have grown at the same rate as James. When he was fifteen he was within an inch of [[James Potter I|James]] at the same age, and when he was seventeen he was exactly the same height his father was, and James was often described as tall. Harry was so much like his father that Harry mistook his future self for him while saving Sirius\u2019s life from the Dementors, although his father was then dead. \n\nHarry wore round-rimmed glasses, peculiarly similar to his father's glasses. During his time hunting Voldemort's [[Horcrux-making spell|Horcruxes]], Harry's black hair grew shoulder length as was described when he saw his reflection in [[Malfoy Manor]]. This was due to his preoccupation with the hunt for the Horcruxes and his lack of interest in his physical appearance, it is the longest his hair has ever been.\n\n[[File:Harry Potter movies hbp promostills 6.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Harry in his [[sixth year]], age 16]]\nUpon Harry's forehead, covered by his unruly black hair, was a [[Harry Potter's scars|scar]] shaped like a lightning bolt. The scar was a result of the failed (and famed) [[Killing Curse]] cast on him by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] when he was an infant. It burned painfully whenever Voldemort was near Harry or feeling particularly strong emotions, but this stopped after Voldemort's death and was reduced into an ordinary scar.\n\nHarry also had a faint scar on the back of his right hand which said, ''\"I must not tell lies\".'' This scar was caused while Harry spent detentions with [[Dolores Umbridge]], who forced him to use the [[Black Quill]] that carved the words into the back of his hand.

K. Rowling]] on why Harry's an excellent role model|Accio Quote!}}\n\nHarry was an extremely brave, loyal, and selfless person who possessed tremendous strength of character. He willingly went to what he truly believed to be his death, because he believed that this was the only way to defeat the Dark Lord. Harry was also marked by what [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] once deemed a \"''weakness for heroics''\" \u2014 he would go to great lengths and take great risks in order to help others, particularly his loved ones. Notably, this was taken advantage of by Voldemort in 1996, when he lured Harry to the [[Department of Mysteries]] by making him believe that his [[Sirius Black|godfather]] was in danger.<ref name=\"OOTP32\">{{OOTP|B|32}}</ref> Harry was also very strong-willed and unafraid to stand up for himself. The fact that he was capable of repelling the [[Imperius Curse]] suggests that he had an unusually strong sense of himself and his morals.<ref name=\"GOF34\">{{GOF|B|34}}</ref> Dumbledore once made parallels between Harry's traits and qualities that [[Salazar Slytherin]] looked for in his own hand-picked students. He also noted that Harry's choice not to draw on those qualities really defined who he was, rather than the simple fact that he had them.<ref name=\"COS18\">{{COS|B|18}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DH2 Harry Potter in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault.jpg|239x239px|thumb|left|Harry resourcefully using the Sword of Gryffindor, as a way of retrieving Hufflepuff's cup from mounds of burning treasure]] \n\n{{Quote|Hmm.

So where shall I put you?|The [[Sorting Hat]] looking into Harry's mind|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}\n\nHarry was perfectly prepared to put his friends' needs and best interests first, shown by how he ended his relationship with [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], due to his concern for her well being (even though being with her was one of the best things that ever happened to him).<ref name=\"HBP30\">{{HBP|B|30}}</ref> The amount of trust that Harry put into his friends was so strong that he absolutely refused to consider that any of them would betray him to Voldemort. Considering that Harry knew a person ([[Peter Pettigrew]]) who had betrayed all of his closest friends to Voldemort, this proves Harry's ability to [[love]] so unequivocally.\n\nThe closeness that Harry felt for many was great enough for him to behave violently if any of them were harmed.<ref name=\"OOTP36\">{{OOTP|B|36}}</ref> When his godfather was murdered by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], Harry attacked her in a grief-stricken rage of righteous anger and attempted to use the [[Cruciatus Curse]] on her. He also attacked [[Severus Snape]] after the latter murdered Dumbledore. Ironically, the only people with whom Harry ever initiated a duel were Snape and Bellatrix and he only desired to do so right after they killed someone he loved. This highlights Harry's bravery even further because Harry was fully aware that Snape and Bellatrix were two very skilled and experienced duellists, but did not hesitate to harm them as soon as he was pushed into it. This can also happen if a loved one of his is, even if it isn't true, insulted in front of him, as he so enraged he was seriously considering attacking [[Albus Dumbledore]] himself when he stated he believed Sirius was wrong to have treated Kreacher the way he did and that he was trying to keep Sirius alive by keeping him in 12 Grimmauld Place, as Harry believed that Dumbledore had no right, despite knowing fully well he was completely outmatched by Dumbledore, who he acknowledged to be the greatest wizard in history, but fortunately for Harry Dumbledore did not resort to such means and calmly levelled with him.\n\n{{Quote|Listen to me, Harry. You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-picked students. His own very rare gift, [[Parseltongue]]; resourcefulness; determination; a certain disregard for the rules...|Dumbledore discussing some of Harry's personality traits|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\n\nHowever, Harry was also accused of being arrogant, in particular by Severus Snape (although Snape's perspective was skewed due to his poor relationship with James Potter, and Harry often found being famous and admired very difficult), and could be hot-tempered and impulsive. This could sometimes make him rude to authority figures such as Professor Snape and [[Minister for Magic]] [[Rufus Scrimgeour]]. In contrast, Dumbledore stated that \"''many teachers report that'' [Harry's] ''modest, likeable, and reasonably talented''\".<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\n[[File:Deathly-hallows1-Harry-snitch.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry brooding over the Snitch, left to him in Dumbledore's will]]\n\nHarry was prone to moodiness and unkind remarks towards even his friends during his adolescence, though this is likely the result of the great emotional stress and trials he endured during this period. Harry displayed many signs of clinical depression throughout his mid-to-late teens, however this extended to his older life. In his mid-to-late teens, Harry showed signs of these symptoms: general discontent, guilt, hopelessness, mood swings, insomnia (nightmares), agitation, irritability, social isolation and even lack of concentration. These symptoms were continued to be well into his mid ages. It was clear that Harry received limited assistance in his depression during his adolescence, although this was possibly improved in his later life.\n\nHarry was also not one to let bygones be bygones. He had a vindictive streak that made him vengeful at best and spiteful at worse towards those who did him wrong. This varied from wanting to murder/torture those who had performed unforgivable acts like: Bellatrix, Voldemort, and [[Dolores Umbridge]] to a desire for pettiness towards: [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], Draco Malfoy, Snape, and the Dursley's. Harry even wanted Sirius (before learning of his innocence) and Pettigrew to suffer the [[Dementor's kiss]] for their crimes and spent the entirety of the Horcrux hunt angry at Dumbledore for the latter's lack of trust.\n\n{{Quote|You're a sharp boy, Potter.|[[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]]'s opinion of Harry's intelligence|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\n\nHarry possessed an instinctual, intuitive intelligence. This intelligence allowed him to make intellectual leaps,  as opposed to the logical intelligence of Hermione. For example, Harry divined the truth about the [[Deathly Hallows]] well before Hermione would accept it.<ref name=\"DH22\">{{DH|B|22}}</ref> And although he was clever, Harry lacked intellectual curiosity. He rarely put forth effort into school work; for instance, he relied on the notes of the [[Severus Snape|Half-Blood Prince]] to get ahead in his sixth year [[Potions (class)|Potions]] class rather than devoting time to studying.<ref name=\"HBP\">{{HBP}}</ref> Although he did study reasonably hard for his [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]]s, the only set of wizarding qualifications he sat at Hogwarts. Harry generally did his best magical work when tackling practical exams rather than theoretical ones. This could be a result of the lack of confidence that Harry developed from growing up with the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]].\n\nBarty Crouch Jnr (disguised as Alastor Moody) remarked that Harry possessed a streak of pride and independence that almost cost him the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. His pride didn't allow him to ask for help regarding the problem of breathing underwater for an hour, which was required for the Second task that took place in the [[Great Lake|Black Lake]], was what almost cost him the competition.<ref name=\"GOF34\" /> Harry was also known for wanting to tackle challenges and obstacles on his own, without the aid or interference of others. His friends had to frequently remind him that he needed their assistance and that he \"''did not always have to go it alone''\".\n\nHarry also seemed to have a bit of an obsessive personality, a trait he shared with his arch enemy Lord Voldemort. He could be somewhat nosy and was known for sleuthing around and getting involved in things that did not concern him. For instance, during his sixth year Harry became intensely preoccupied with finding out what Malfoy was doing in his free time.<ref name=\"HBP\" /> He also developed on unhealthy obsession with the [[Deathly Hallows]], to the point where he was listless with longing for the three artefacts. This period of listlessness lasted for many weeks during the hunt for Lord Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es.\n\n[[File:Harry_&_Ginny_kiss.gif|250px|thumb|left|Harry and his [[love]] for Ginny Weasley, his then ex-girlfriend and future wife]]\n\nHarry's greatest strength was his ability to feel love, despite having a miserable childhood of neglect. Harry was extremely loyal to and protective of his loved ones and that love was what allowed him to overcome Voldemort. Dumbledore noted that Harry's strength of will at resisting the temptation of the [[Dark Arts]], even when granted a direct insight into Voldemort's mind and methods was due to Harry's ability to love. Harry even claimed that he felt sorry for Voldemort because of his inability to feel or understand love. Ginny, his wife, commented that he was the kindest and most loving man anyone would ever meet.<ref name=\"HBP23\">{{HBP|B|23}}</ref>\n\nAlbus Dumbledore noted that Harry was unfailingly kind and compassionate. This is shown by how he freed [[Dobby]] from the Malfoys and by standing up for [[Muggle-born]]s, [[half-blood]]s, and [[half-breed]]s (like Hagrid). This is likely attributable to his childhood, during which the Dursleys deprived him of compassion and discriminated against him due to his [[magic]]al abilities. His compassionate led him to spare the life of [[Delphini|Delphi]], the daughter of Lord Voldemort, despite the history between himself and the Dark Lord. Also, Harry was not a cruel person and he never wished anyone harm. He rarely initiated duels, instead fighting in self-defence. Even after Bellatrix Lestrange had murdered his godfather, Harry failed to cast the Cruciatus Curse on her. Bellatrix noted the he had failed to cast the curse properly because he had cast it out of righteous anger and not malicious intent.<ref name=\"OOTP36\" /> However, he did use the Cruciatus Curse more effectively on [[Amycus Carrow]] after he spat at and insulted [[Minerva McGonagall]]. In addition, he saved Peter Pettigrew from being killed by his (Pettigrew's) former friends Sirius Black and Remus Lupin, though this was not done for humanitarian reasons but for the memory of his father.\n\nRemus Lupin once noted that Harry had very good and nearly always right instincts.<ref name=\"DH22\" /> Harry had a strong awareness of the incalculable power of certain acts, which is never more apparent than when he refused to allow Lupin to accompany him and leave his wife and child at home and realised that Ron Weasley was meant to destroy [[Slytherin's locket]].\n\n[[File:Harry_temper.gif|241x241px|thumb|right|Harry loses his temper with [[Marjorie Dursley|\"Aunt\" Marge]]]]\n\nIn some ways, Harry could become extremely intimidating toward people, such as [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], [[Mundungus Fletcher]], Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley. Harry was seen becoming extremely frightening when pushed to the point of anger or extreme annoyance. When in a bad mood and argumentative, even Harry's closest friends had been wary of him, usually replying to his angry tone in a calm and appeasing voice. The only person who did not appear to be afraid of him when he was angry (other than his teachers and other authority figures in his life) was Ginny Weasley. Dumbledore was a special case, as he acted fatherly towards Harry and had managed to successfully calm him down whenever he got angry with him.\n\nHarry seemed to have good and long memory, as he remembered the motorbike ride to Privet Drive with Hagrid when he was eleven and could remember the deaths of his mother and Voldemort's laughter when the events occurred ten years earlier.<ref name=\"PS\">{{PS}}</ref> Despite needing glasses, Harry possessed a tremendous eyesight as well; he was able to locate the [[Golden Snitch]] (which was approximately the size of a golf ball) in a massive Quidditch field. Harry also cared very much for his children. He comforted his daughter, [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Potter]], when she was upset about not going to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. He also made sure his younger son [[Albus Potter]] would not be teased a lot by Harry's older son, [[James Potter II|James Potter]].\n\n{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Severus Snape|Do you remember me telling you we are practising nonverbal spells, Potter?|Harry Potter|Yes.|Yes ''sir''.|There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor.|Harry being cheeky to Snape during a DADA lesson|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\n\nAlthough never as given to sarcasm or humour as his best friend Ron, Harry often displayed a dry wit. For instance, on finding out that [[Hermione Granger]] intended to take twelve O.W.Ls, he asked her if she planned to eat or sleep at all that year. This humour often became more cutting when applied to people Harry disliked. When threatened by [[Draco Malfoy]] and his cronies after the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], Harry remarked that he supposed that \"''Lord Voldemort's just a warm-up act compared to you three?''\", responding to Malfoy's threat that he was dead by casually commenting \"''funny, you'd think I'd have stopped walking around''\".<ref name=\"OOTP38\" /> Harry also displayed wittiness when he first encountered [[Crookshanks]], remarking that he was either \"''a very large cat or quite a small tiger''\".<ref name=\"POA4\">{{POA|B|4}}</ref>\n\nHe was also known to apply his cutting wit to Severus Snape and Dudley Dursley as well. During his first Potions lesson, Snape antagonised Harry with question after question. This was until Harry responded with \"''I don't know. I think Hermione does, though, why don't you try her?''\"<ref name=\"PS\" /> He also commented that he was surprised that Dudley was intelligent enough to know the days of the week, after Dudley stated he knew what day it was. When Harry was eleven, [[Dudley]] suggested that he and Harry should do upstairs and practise shoving heads down toilets. Harry then stated that the toilet had never had something as disgusting as Dudley's head down it. \n\n[[File:HP5-01765.jpg|251x251px|thumb|left|Harry as the leader of Dumbledore's Army, while teaching a lesson on the [[Stunning Spell]]]]\n\nAlthough he never sought power himself and would be content with a normal life, when a situation required him to step up he would do so. Such as when he, Ron, and Hermione discovered Voldemort and Quirrell's attempt to steal the [[Philosopher's Stone]] and his time as teacher/leader of [[Dumbledore's Army]]. Harry has shown not-inconsiderable leadership abilities, to the point that Dumbledore reflected that Harry was a better leader than him as he never sought power for himself but simply had to assume the mantle of leadership due to circumstances beyond his control and found in the process that he did it well.\n\nDuring his youth, Harry tended to see things in a rather stark, absolute manner, particularly when it came to the [[Hogwarts Houses]]. Harry generally regarded members of [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]] as evil and therefore his enemies, while [[Gryffindor]]s, [[Ravenclaw]], and [[Hufflepuff]]s were allies. The former part could be due to his own status as a Gryffindor and that many of the Slytherins he encountered, such as Lord Voldemort, Draco Malfoy, and Severus Snape, were significant enemies of his during this period. In addition, many of his friends and allies, such as: Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, and Hagrid, were fellow Gryffindors. However, this mentality eroded as he aged, since he encountered both allies among Slytherin, such as [[Horace Slughorn]] (and later, Snape) and enemies among the other three Houses, such as Peter Pettigrew (a fellow Gryffindor) and [[Quirinus Quirrell]] (a Ravenclaw). By 2017, Harry had adopted a more moderate attitude on the Houses, telling his younger son Albus Potter that \"''it doesn't matter to us''\" if Albus was Sorted in Slytherin or Gryffindor. In addition, Harry named that same son after [[Severus Snape]], whom he recounted as \"''the bravest man'' [he] ''ever knew''\".\n\nIn the aftermath of the Secondary Wizarding War, Harry was shown to suffer from survivor's guilt and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. These two symptoms extended into his childhood and throughout his life at Hogwarts. Because of his depression, he also claimed that he was supposed to die and everyone knew it, but he survived it all. He also claimed that too many people died for the \"Boy Who Lived\" and that he wasn't worth dying for at all. Harry's depression and trauma were caused by not having removed Voldemort completely from his life, and he feared that he would always allow Voldemort to have some mental and emotional control over him. \n\nHarry also had shown signs of suffering from recurring clinical depression, such as his sullen and withdrawn demeanour during his mid-to-late teens as a result of the tragedies in his life. A particular symptom of this was his outrageous temper during his bouts of depression, which frightened all but Ginny by their sheer force and magnitude alone. Overall, Harry was much the same as any other soldier, struggling to carry on despite the horrors of his past and the brutality he had been a part of for so long. \n\nHarry did have some fears, although he hid them extremely well from his family. In fact, he hid them so well that his younger son considered his father to be utterly fearless. These fears included the dark, pigeons, small spaces, and seeing his family in danger. \n\nIt is commented by his son that Harry's personality was complicated, something that was furthered by Ron, who called him intense in terms of his traits and past experiences.<ref name=\"CC415\">{{CC|B|4|15}}</ref>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n[[File:Patronus_PM_SilverStagPatronus_MomentIllust.jpg|220px|thumb|Harry's corporeal stag [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]]]]\n\n{{Quote|Harry.... is becoming exceptionally good at [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]].

In spite of being raised by a family that treated him with anything but affection, Harry remarkably turned out capable of very strong love. For example, Harry's love for his friends caused him to sacrifice himself to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. This loving sacrifice conferred a certain amount of [[Sacrificial protection|protection]] onto his allies, making it so that [[spell]]s Voldemort tried to place on them quickly wore off.<ref name=\"DH36\">{{DH|B|36}}</ref> Harry's ability to love has also protected and helped him on several occasions. Those occasions are: when he produced a Patronus that could drive hundreds of [[Dementor]]s away,<ref>{{POA}}</ref> repelled Voldemort when he possessed him,<ref name=\"OOTP36\" /> and the times he was able to close the connection between himself and Voldemort.<ref name=\"DH24\">{{DH|B|24}}</ref> His love was strongest when directed at [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], who was the driving force that kept him going until Voldemort was defeated. Harry also felt strong love toward his three children, such as when he deliberately placed himself between his son [[Albus Potter|Albus]] and a [[Killing Curse]]. Harry even felt compassion and pity for his enemies, offering Voldemort a chance to feel remorse for his actions.\n\n{{Quote|Harry, you're the best in the year at Defence Against the Dark Arts.|[[Hermione Granger]] emphasising Harry's talent in defensive magic|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n\n[[File:Tumblr lvya0rfkNa1qgt0vro7 r1 250.gif|250px|thumb|right|Harry defends himself against [[Grindylow]]s in 1995]]\n*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Harry was extremely adept at Defence Against the Dark Arts, having mastered all manners of spells.

He was also skilled at defending himself against Dark creatures such as: [[Grindylow]]s, [[Red Cap]]s, [[Hinkypunk]]s, [[Boggart]]s, [[Erkling]]s, and [[Dementor]]s. In his third year, he was the only student who flawlessly made it through the end-of-the-year exam (an obstacle course containing some of the said creatures.<ref name=\"POA16\">{{POA|B|16}}</ref>) In his fifth year, [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] stated that [[Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] said he showed a \"pronounced aptitude\" for the subject and that he had \"''achieved high marks on all his Defence Against the Dark Arts tests''\".<ref name=\"OOTP29\">{{OOTP|B|29}}</ref> In fact, Harry had beaten Hermione in two of the three Defence Against the Dark Arts exams they had taken together. The only exam she beat him in was their first year exam and Hermione later reflected that it did not count, as Quirrell \"wasn't a particularly good teacher\".<ref name=\"OOTP16\">{{OOTP|B|16}}</ref> Harry improved his skills in this subject significantly during his fourth year, by learning a lot of new spells in order to face the Triwizard Tournament. During his O.W.L. examination, Professor [[Tofty]] (Wizarding Examinations Authority) expressed pleasure at Harry's performance of Defence Against the Dark Arts, calling it \"excellent\".<ref name=\"OOTP31\">{{OOTP|B|31}}</ref> This statement was later proven true when he achieved an '[[Outstanding]]'<ref name=\"HBP5\" /> Defence Against the Dark Arts [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] (something that not even Hermione achieved), a testament of his extraordinary talent in defensive magic. In 1996, Ron stated that it came as no surprise that Harry was top of the class at Defence Against the Dark Arts.<ref name=\"HBP5\" /> Indeed, Harry was so good at DADA that when the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] prevented the subject from being taught effectively in [[1995]], he set up his own DADA club and successfully taught members how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts. He immediately became an [[Auror]] after the Second Wizarding War, which also required considerable skill in both defensive and offensive magic. Harry also developed a high level of resistance towards the [[Imperius Curse]], demonstrated when it was cast upon him by [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] (disguised as [[Alastor Moody]]) in 1994 and by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] himself in 1995.<ref name=\"GOF34\" />\n{{Quote|...there's no point pretending that you're not good at Defence Against the Dark Arts, because you are.

He was able to single-handedly defeat some of the most formidable [[Death Eaters]] and even survive numerous encounters with [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] himself. He eventually defeated Voldemort by becoming the master of the [[Elder Wand]]. In many battles of the Second Wizarding War, he was able to incapacitate much more experienced Death Eaters. During the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]; he, [[Albus Dumbledore]], and [[Remus Lupin]] were the only fighters on the Order's side to emerge from the battle physically unscathed. In that time, he had held off [[Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Antonin Dolohov]] twice and was able to hold his own against the extremely powerful [[Bellatrix Lestrange]].<ref name=\"OOTP\">{{OOTP}}</ref> In [[1997]] Harry defeated [[Corban Yaxley|Yaxley]], [[Fenrir Greyback]], and one of the two Carrows.<ref name=\"DH23\">{{DH|B|23}}</ref> He fought off several Death Eaters in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]. During the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]] he overpowered Lucius Malfoy, [[Draco Malfoy]], and Fenrir Greyback and avoided direct conflict damage all throughout the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].<ref name=\"DH32\">{{DH|B|32}}</ref> Harry was known to be very quick off the draw and had an aggressive duelling style, even incorporating Unforgivable Curses. He was also known to taunt his opponents and would get them to talk at length, angering them and throwing them mentally off-balance. He did this in order to buy himself time to strategise or to lull them into lowering their guard. Harry was especially skilled in the [[Disarming Charm]] and used it so much that it was seen as his \"signature spell\" by many Death Eaters. His most notable uses of the Disarming Charm were when he formed [[Reverse Spell|Priori Incantatem]] with Voldemort and when he finally killed the Dark Lord.

It also helped him in the Triwizard Tournament (where he had to steal a golden egg from a [[Hungarian Horntail]]), managing to successfully irritate the dragon into chasing him by dodging all her flame attacks and then outrace her into the egg, a display that highly impressed all of the witnesses and earned him the first place among the Triwizard Champions.

After that soul fragment was destroyed, Harry seemingly lost this ability. However, in 2020, Harry had somehow regained the ability to speak Parseltongue again, although it was possible he never lost to begin with or that the ability simply became temporarily suppressed after the Horcrux was destroyed.\n*'''[[Mind-reading|Insight into Voldemort's mind]]''': Also due to the piece of Voldemort's soul, Harry was able to look into Voldemort's mind and see through his senses from time to time. He sometimes used this ability to monitor what [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] was doing. However, it was a dangerous ability to have as well; Voldemort once used it, along with [[Legilimency]], to plant a false vision in Harry's mind of [[Sirius Black]] being tortured, which he used to lure Harry to the [[Department of Mysteries]].<ref name=\"OOTP23\">{{OOTP|B|23}}</ref> Additionally, because of their connection, Harry felt a burning pain in his scar whenever he and Voldemort were in close proximity or whenever Voldemort felt strong negative emotions. Harry lost this ability as well when the soul fragment within him was destroyed. Harry also possessed a non-magical insight into Voldemort's mind from the information Dumbledore shared with him during their lessons. This insight allowed Harry to figure out that a [[Horcrux]] was stored at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] after which Ron and Hermoine noted Harry's understanding of Voldemort causing to Harry admit that he did understand parts of Voldemort.\n*'''[[Master of Death]]''': Harry mastered all three Deathly Hallows and accepted his own death.<ref name=\"DH\" /> First, he inherited the [[Cloak of Invisibility]] from his father, James. Then, he inherited the [[Resurrection Stone]] from Dumbledore, which was inside a snitch. Finally, he won the [[Elder Wand]] from Draco Malfoy during the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]]. All three were directly or indirectly employed by Harry in the [[Forbidden Forest]]: he was wearing the Cloak, using the Stone, and was preparing to be killed by the Wand, which he had already won.<ref name=\"DH34\">{{DH|B|34}}</ref> The only Hallow he choose to keep was the cloak as it was a priceless family heirloom; the stone was lost in the forest and the wand returned to Dumbledore's tomb.<ref name=\"DH36\" />\n\n{{Quote|He had even exceeded expectations at Potions!|Harry reviewing his O.W.L. result|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\n\n[[File:Harry_potions_sixth_year_1_hi_res.jpeg|250px|thumb|right|Harry brewing a [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level potion]]\n*'''[[Potion]]s''': Although Harry's strong dislike for Snape made Potions the subject he was worst at, it was later on shown that Harry had no problem with potions with Slughorn as his teacher,<ref name=\"OOTP29\" /><ref name=\"OOTP31\" /> showing that he had indeed inherited Lily's talent in potions to some extent. This was also shown when Snape did not pester him about his brewing a reasonably adequate [[Strengthening Solution]] and Harry even concocted an [[Invigoration Draught]] good enough that he would have earned an Exceeds Expectations had Hermione not vanished it. Indeed, he achieved an '[[Exceeds Expectations]]'<ref name=\"HBP5\" /> on his O.W.L. exam \u2014 proof of his proficiency in the subject and was one of only twelve students able to reach the required level to take [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] potions, although he wouldn't have if Snape had kept teaching Potions.<ref name=\"HBP9\" /> His great success during his sixth year was only after he came into possession of the [[Severus Snape's copy of Advanced Potion-Making|Half-Blood Prince's copy of ''Advanced Potion-Making'']] which contained revised instructions from the Half-Blood Prince ([[Severus Snape]]). Using that textbook, Harry gained the position of best in class, surpassing even Hermione's efforts. However, after he had to hide the Prince's book, Harry was still able to do a decent enough job at potion-making that [[Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]]'s suspicions were not raised. It was probable that he improved his Potions ability during his Auror career, at least becoming proficient enough in Poisons and Antidotes as required.\n\n{{Quote|I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased.|[[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] complimenting Harry's O.W.L. result|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\n*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Harry achieved an 'Exceeds Expectations'<ref name=\"HBP5\" /> on his O.W.L. exam, showing proficiency in the subject and advanced to [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level.

He was also one of very few in his class who was able to see [[Thestral]]s, and had no trouble mounting his in June 1996. Harry was also good with [[House-elf|House-elves]], befriending the house-elf [[Dobby]] and eventually freeing him.

He had been shown to rise from defeat and loss, such as the deaths of many loved ones, even stronger than before. Harry's indomitable will was exemplified by his ability to resist the [[Imperius Curse]] and possibly, on the other hand, by his ability to cast powerful Imperius Curses. It was also exemplified by the fact that he had never begged for mercy (even in life-and-death situations), he would fight back in defiance of himself, as well as perform [[Nonverbal spell|non-verbal spells]] flawlessly.<ref name=\"DH\" /> His inability to perform [[Occlumency]] (despite possessing the required willpower) was due to his inability to keep his emotions under control.\n*'''Detective skills''': Harry was a formidably talented investigator. While in school, he and his friends had a knack for solving difficult mysteries and discovering the truth despite all attempts by others to conceal it. Hermione generally finding the background information, while Harry put the pieces together to make a coherent picture. In his first year, Harry uncovered the truth about the [[Philosopher's Stone]] and saved it from Voldemort. Over the next six years, he would solve the mystery of the [[Chamber of Secrets]] and understand how the Basilisk's victims were attacked and why they did not die, but more importantly he located the entrance of the Chamber and rightly supposed that the victim of the first opening of the Chamber was [[Myrtle Warren|Moaning Myrtle]];<ref name=\"COS15\">{{COS|B|15}}</ref> understand, with almost no clues, what Dumbledore wanted he and Hermione to do after spinning the Time Turner; find the truth about the [[prophecy]]; hunt down and destroy all of Voldemort's Horcruxes using his amazing deductive skills. During his sixth year, he also observed Dumbledore's memories about Voldemort and noticed things which would help him later. Harry's deductive skills also allowed him to uncover the mystery of the [[Deathly Hallows]].<ref name=\"DH22\" /> He discovered that he mastered the three of them, when even Ron and Hermione were initially sceptical of their existence. Harry also had a knack for spotting things that others did not, and had a sharp eye for details. He was able to tell that [[Luna Lovegood]] had not been home in weeks by the state of her room,<ref name=\"DH21\">{{DH|B|21}}</ref> and he became suspicious when Dobby revealed that he had known that Harry was not getting any letters in [[1992]].

He did this in an attempt to warn Snape and by extension the Order, that Voldemort had Sirius. In the same year, while surrounded by [[Death Eaters]] Harry came up with the plan to smash the shelves in the [[Hall of Prophecy]]. This was a distraction so that he and the [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] could try and escape. During the hunt for [[Horcrux]]es, he used the [[Sword of Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor's Sword]] as a way of retrieving [[Hufflepuff's Cup|Helga Hufflepuff's cup]] from the mounds of burning treasure and used a half-blind [[dragon]] as a means to escape from [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]].<ref name=\"DH26\" /> Harry was also cunning enough that the Sorting Hat heavily considered Sorting him into [[Slytherin]] house.<ref name=\"PS7\" />\n{{Quote|It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it.

The protective enchantments on the door were far stronger than the magic of the enchanted knife.\n[[File:Harry potter balai firebolt 175 7.jpg|226x226px|thumb|right|A Firebolt, his second broom and a Christmas gift]]\n*'''[[Harry Potter's Firebolt|Firebolt]]''': During Harry's third year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], the [[Nimbus 2000]] [[broomstick]] he'd been riding since his first year was destroyed by the [[Whomping Willow]], and [[Sirius Black]] replaced it by giving Harry the [[Firebolt|finest broom]] available as an anonymous gift. The broom was one of Harry's most prized possessions for years. It was lost during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]. It is not known if Harry ever recovered or replaced it.\n*'''[[Harry Potter's Nimbus 2000|Nimbus 2000]]''': This broomstick was gifted to him from [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] after agreeing to join the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] in 1991. He used it during his first and second years at Hogwarts. In his third year it blew into the [[Whomping Willow]] and was smashed to bits, breaking it beyond repair.\n*'''[[Two-way mirror|Communication mirror]]''': Harry also owns one in a pair of [[two-way mirror]]s, given to him by his godfather [[Sirius Black]]. The mirror was intended to be a means covert communication, but Harry broke it out of anger over Sirius' death. Harry did not realise the mirror could still work, although he kept a shard out of sentimentality. When Harry and several friends are captured at [[Malfoy Manor]], at the time being used as a headquarters for Voldemort, Harry used the shard of mirror to communicate with [[Aberforth Dumbledore]], who had the other mirror. Aberforth sent [[Dobby]] to rescue Harry and the other prisoners.\n*'''[[Harry Potter's schoolbag|Schoolbag]]''': A schoolbag was used by Harry Potter to carry around textbooks, quills, and other items throughout his six years attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. It is possible that this bag was used even in his [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] education before attending Hogwarts.[[File:Harry In his New Jumper from Mrs Weasley.jpg|150px|thumb|Harry wearing a Weasley jumper]]\n*'''[[Weasley jumper]]s''': Harry received a homemade jumper every [[Christmas]] from [[Molly Weasley|Mrs Weasley]]. His were said to be much more extravagant, as Mrs Weasley \"made much more effort\" when her presents were not made for actual family members. The known jumpers he has include an emerald green one, a scarlet one, a green one with a [[Hungarian Horntail]] on the front, and one with a [[Golden Snitch]] on the front.\n*'''[[Sneakoscope]]''': Hermione Granger gave Harry a Sneakoscope as a gift for his seventeenth birthday at breakfast, the trio would later take it on their [[Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter's Horcrux Hunt|hunt for Horcruxes]].\n*'''[[Harry Potter's alarm clock|Alarm clock]]''': In the summer of [[1991]], Harry found and repaired the alarm clock and in the summer of [[1996]], this alarm clock ticked on Harry's windowsill as he slept on the night that [[Albus Dumbledore]] came to collect him.\n*'''[[Harry Potter's first Golden Snitch|Golden Snitch]]''': This Snitch was caught by Harry during the [[1991\u20131992 school year]]. It was later left to him in Albus Dumbledore's will, to posthumously ensure that [[Marvolo Gaunt's Ring]] would be safely delivered to him.\n\n{{Quote|Harry took off his watch, which he was only wearing out of habit, as it didn't work anymore, and stuffed it into his pocket.|Harry takes off his watch before a lesson about [[niffler]]s|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\n*'''[[Harry Potter's watch|Watch]]''': This watch was used by Harry until it was destroyed in the [[Triwizard Tournament#The Second Task|Second Task]] of the [[Triwizard Tournament]], since it was not waterproof and by [[May]] of [[1995]], he had discarded the watch entirely.\n[[File:Harry Potter (GoF-07) dress robes.jpg|250x250px|thumb|Harry's dress robes at the Yule Ball]]\n*'''[[Harry Potter's dress robes|Dress robes]]''': Harry wore dress robes to the [[Yule Ball]] for the [[1994]] [[Triwizard Tournament]], they were bottle green that matched his eyes. He also wore dress robes to [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|Bill and Fleur's wedding]] in 1997. He also wore a set of dress robes to Slughorn's Christmas Party in 1996.\n*'''[[Fabian Prewett's watch]]''': [[Molly Weasley]] gave Harry the watch of her late brother [[Fabian Prewett]] for his [[Harry Potter's seventeenth birthday|seventeenth birthday]]. It has a dent in it, but Harry kept the watch, even into his thirties. The watch does not have arms; rather, it has stars.\n*'''[[Mokeskin pouch]]''': A birthday present from Hagrid. Harry kept it with him throughout the Deathly Hallows, and kept in it his treasures that were of no use to his search; the Snitch, the broken mirror, his broken wand, his mother's letter and the fake Horcrux. Harry also received a photo album, from Hagrid, which had photos of his parents and other family members.\n*'''[[Harry Potter's rucksack|Rucksack]]''': This rucksack was owned by Harry during the 1997-1998 school year. He packed it with everything he felt he would need during the [[Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter's Horcrux Hunt|hunt for Horcruxes]]. He almost lost it during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], but managed to keep hold of it.\n*'''[[Enchanted razor]]''': In 1997, Harry received an enchanted razor on his seventeenth birthday from [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]]. It is not known whether he used it at any point or if he still owns it.\n*'''''[[Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts]]''''': This book had moving colour illustrations of all the [[counter-jinx]]es and [[hex]]es it described.

Harry planned to put them to good use in his lessons for [[Dumbledore's Army]].\n*''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them|'''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them''']]'': Harry owned a copy of this book, as was mandatory for any student of Hogwarts studying [[Care of Magical Creatures]]. He shared it with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] after the latter lost his. The trio doodled and wrote messages to each other throughout the book.\n*'''''[[Flying with the Cannons]]''''': Harry received a copy of this from Ron Weasley in 1992 as a Christmas present.<ref name=\"CoS\">{{COS}}</ref>\n*'''''[[Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland]]''''': [[Hermione Granger]] gave this book to Harry in [[1994]], as a Christmas gift.\n*'''''[[Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches]]''''': This book is a sophomoric manual on dating and flirting with girls. A copy was given to Harry on his seventeenth birthday from [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. Harry speculated that there might be an entire chapter devoted to compliments.\n*'''[[Harry Potter's notebook|Notebook]]''': This notebook was owned by Harry from at least [[1997]]. It was used to keep his notes and other writings, such as things he wanted to remember.\n*'''[[Harry Potter's toy broomstick|Toy broomstick]]''': this was a gift to him from Sirius Black, it was the first broomstick he had ridden. It's unknown what happened to it after the [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)|1981 attack at Godric's Hollow]].\n*'''[[Harry Potter's car|Car]]''': This car was used by Harry to drive his family to [[King's Cross Station]] on 1 September, 2017. On [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters|Platform 9\u00be]], Ron Weasley asked Harry if he had parked the vehicle alright, then told him he had managed to park his own car.\n*'''[[Harry and Ginevra Potter's house|Family home]]:''' Sometime following the war, Harry acquired his own house and raised his three children there alongside his wife, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]]. This can be assumed due to Harry denying James' request to have Teddy move in with them in exchange for sharing a room with his younger brother. Harry replied that he would only allow the two Potter brothers to share a room when \"[he wanted] the house demolished.\"\n\n<br />\n\n{{Quote|As you can see, Harry, Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership.|[[Albus Dumbledore]] confirming that Harry now owns the Black estate|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\n[[File:B5C4M1 Advance Guard and Harry outside Grimmauld Place.jpg|250px|thumb|right|12 Grimmauld Place, London]]\n*[[12 Grimmauld Place|'''12 Grimmauld Place''']]: Following Sirius's death, Harry inherited his family's London townhouse with all its contents and furnishings, including [[Kreacher]] (the family [[house-elf]]).

Given the ease with which he learned to fly a broomstick, ride animals such as hippogriffs and thestrals, and even a dragon, Harry likely learned how to ride with very little trouble at all.\n\n==Relationships==\n<!-- Please do NOT copy/paste the contents of the Harry Potter's relationships page here! -->\n{{Main|Harry Potter's relationships}}\nThroughout his life, Harry has had many relationships with a variety of people. Because of his upbringing, he had few connections in his early years, the only people he truly interacted with being the abusive [[Dursley family|Dursleys]]. With his introduction to the wizarding world, this changed and he built connections with many of the residents of the magical community, both good and bad. His strongest relationships were with: [[James and Lily Potter|his parents]], [[Potter family|his children]], [[Hermione Granger]], the [[Weasley family]], [[Sirius Black]], [[Hedwig]], [[Dobby]], [[Albus Dumbledore]], [[Rubeus Hagrid]], [[Minerva McGonagall]], [[Remus Lupin]], [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Cho Chang]], [[Luna Lovegood]] and [[Edward Lupin|Teddy Lupin]].\n\n==Etymology==\n{{w|Harry (name)|Harry}} is the Middle English form of the name {{w|Henry (given name)|Henry}}, derived from the Germanic name ''Heinrich,'' from the words ''heim,'' meaning \"home\", and ''ric'', meaning \"power, ruler\". It has been a very popular name in the English-speaking world for centuries. Harry can also be a diminutive form of the name Harold, from the Old English name ''Hereweald'', meaning \"leader of the army\". It has been the name of five kings of Norway, three kings of Denmark, and two kings of England.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=harry Behind the Name: Harry]</ref><ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/harold Behind the Name: Harold]</ref> In an interview J. K. Rowling stated that 'Harry' had always been one of her favourite boy's names and that if her daughter had been a son she would have named him 'Harry', although then she would have to have come up with a different name for the books as it ''\"would have been too cruel to name him after my own son\".''<ref name=\"accio-quote.org\">http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-scholastic-chat.htm</ref> It is possible that he was named after [[Henry Potter]], nicknamed 'Harry', who was James' grandfather and Harry's great-grandfather. \n\n{{w|James (name)|James}} is derived from the same Hebrew name as Jacob, meaning \u201cholds the heel\u201d (in the Genesis narrative, Jacob was born grasping Esau\u2032s heel and later bought his birthright). The name came into English language from the French variation of the Late Latin name Iacomus, a dialect variant of Iacobus, from the New Testament Greek \u1f38\u03ac\u03ba\u03c9\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 (Iak\u014dbos), from Hebrew word \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1 (Ya\u02bbaqov). James is Harry's middle name, James was the name of his father and is also the name of his first son.\n\n{{w|Potter}} is a very common surname of English origin.<ref>[http://surnames.behindthename.com/top/search.php?terms=potter Behind the Name: Rankings for 'Potter']</ref> It traditionally refers to the occupation of making pottery. {{w|Beatrix Potter}} was a well-known English children's author. {{w|Potter's Field}} is the name for a burial ground for the unknown or unclaimed dead, particularly soldiers and orphans; the Potter family had many members that fit that description. The {{w|Potter Box}} is a model for making ethical decisions developed at Harvard University. [[J. K. Rowling]] has also commented that she has liked the name since childhood, as a family that had lived near her carried this surname.<ref name=\"accio-quote.org\" /><ref>[http://www.mugglenet.com/books/name_origins2.shtml MuggleNet: Name Origins]</ref> The last name \"Potter\" was also carried by the first successful magician in 1811 in America named Richard Potter<ref>{{wikilink|Richard Potter (magician)}}</ref> who also happened to be African-American, the land that was bought by the magician and where Potter lived was called \"Potter Place\".<ref>http://andoverhistory.org/richard-potter-gravesite/</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Further|[[Harry Potter's relationships#Behind the scenes|Behind the scenes of Harry Potter's relationships]]}}\n[[File:DH chapter 18 BW.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Harry in {{DH}} chapter art by [[Mary GrandPr\u00e9]]<!-- completely misusing the word \"concept art\"; KINDLY look up what the word actually means and don't falsely use it-->]]\n[[File:Harry Potter in cupboard under the stairs - Jim Kay PS IE.jpg|150px|thumb|Harry in {{PS|IE}} by [[Jim Kay]]]]\n[[File:Da-harry.jpg|150px|thumb|Harry on {{PM}} by [[Owen Davey]]]]\n[[File:HarryPotterWU.png|150px|thumb|Harry Potter as he appears in {{WU}}]]\n[[File:Harry Potter - PAS.png|150px|thumb|Harry Potter as seen in {{PAS}}]]\n<!--if it wasn't obvious tidbit closer to being in-universe placed higher-->\n*He often describes various parts of his anatomy as feeling like [[lead]].\n*The [[Marauders]] believed they discovered more secret places than anyone else in the history of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. This is not necessarily true, as unlike Harry and [[Tom Riddle]], they did not discover the [[Chamber of Secrets]] or the [[Room of Requirement]]. However, as they discovered an untold number of secret passages and hidden rooms, they did discover more numerous secrets than Riddle or Harry, just not the same ones.\n*Like his best friend Ron Weasley, Harry got a Muggle driving licence and bought himself a car, but it was never said if they got the Licence to Apparate (although, both of them having been Aurors, most likely they did).\n*The only autographs he ever gave out were to [[Colin Creevey]] and an unknown man on the Hogwarts Express.\n*Harry Potter is still the only wizard to this day that has had all three [[Unforgivable Curses]] cast on him and survived.\n**He also used two out of the three: the [[Cruciatus Curse]] and the [[Imperius Curse]]. The only one he never used was the [[Killing Curse]], which, on the contrary, is his nemesis' favourite spell.\n*Like his parents, Harry personally defied Voldemort three times before defeating him the fourth time: once in the [[Underground Chambers]], once at the cemetery in Little Hangleton, and once again during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. However, there were five previous encounters, if one counts the events of Harry's second year with [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|Tom Riddle's Diary]], though that was a memory instead of the real Voldemort, and the night his parents were killed in [[Godric's Hollow]].\n*Harry's initial trouble with [[Potions (class)|Potions]] is somewhat ironic as he has famous [[potioneer]]s in [[Potter family|his family]], notably [[Linfred of Stinchcombe]] (\"the Potterer\") who first established the [[Vault 687|family fortune]] with his medicinal potions and [[Fleamont Potter]] who was said to have quadrupled the fortune with his [[Sleekeazy's Hair Potion]]. According to [[Horace Slughorn]], Harry's mother [[Lily J. Potter|Lily]] was also an accomplished potioneer in her own right. Some of this does come from Harry's enmity with [[Severus Snape]] but it is portrayed as his weakness. However, he makes strides in later novels.\n*Despite Remus Lupin suggested him not to let the ''[[Disarming Charm|Expelliarmus]]'' become his signature spell, this was the very spell which Harry used in his last duel against Voldemort.\n*The only person Harry ever considered killing by use of curse was [[Sirius Black]] and possibly [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], ironically to avenge Sirius. It is, however, unclear if Harry knew how to cast the [[Killing Curse|Avada Kedavra]] curse since he was not taught the [[Unforgivable Curses]] until his fourth year. Furthermore, when Harry found out that [[Peter Pettigrew]] was the one who had betrayed his parents to Voldemort, he did not want Sirius and [[Remus Lupin]] to kill Pettigrew in revenge. Even during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], in which Harry defeated [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], Harry did not do so by use of any curse intended to do harm to his opponent, but rather he used his \"trademark\", [[Disarming Charm|Expelliarmus]]. Harry finished Voldemort by reflecting a curse Harry would never use on another, even his mortal enemy. This suggests the [[love]], which is \"the power the Dark Lord knows not...\" makes it difficult for Harry to kill. Even during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], Harry illustrated his unwillingness to kill [[Death Eaters]]. During that battle, the Death Eaters were masked at the time, so he could not know who was a willing follower and who was a controlled drone. However, in the example with Voldemort, Harry knew Voldemort's [[Killing Curse]] would backfire, so rather than use the same curse which would make him look somewhat bad, he instead decided to use the [[Disarming Charm]] to gain possession of the wand.\n*Harry was very much like [[Newton Scamander]] as they both didn't seek power nor popularity and also was liked by the same person, [[Albus Dumbledore]].\n*Harry learns a new mode of transportation in every year since he was introduced to magic:\n**In his first year, he learns to travel by [[broomstick]].\n**In his second year, he travels by [[Floo Powder]] and [[Flying Ford Anglia]].\n**In his third year, he travels on the [[Knight Bus]] and [[Buckbeak]] the [[hippogriff]] lets him take a ride on his back.\n**In his fourth year, he gets to the [[Quidditch World Cup]] by [[portkey]].\n**In his fifth year, he travels to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] by [[Thestral]].\n**In his sixth year, he learns to [[Apparition|Apparate]].\n**In what would have been his seventh year, he breaks into [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]] and flies out on a [[dragon]].[[File:Brilliant Quidditch Captain Harry WU.png|150px|thumb|Quidditch Captain Harry Potter as he appears in {{WU}}]]\n[[File:Dhharryroomhighreso.png|thumb|Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter]]\n*Despite being a talented Quidditch player (and the team Seeker, considered the most important player on the team), Harry never played a full season (every minute of all three matches):\n**In his first year, he was recuperating in the hospital wing after saving the Philosopher's Stone, and thus missed the final match.\n**In his second year, the final match of the season was cancelled due to the attack on Hermione and [[Penelope Clearwater]].\n**In his third year, Harry came closest to playing a full season, but spent the last few seconds of the opening Gryffindor vs. Hufflepuff match unconscious after being attacked by Dementors.\n**In his fourth year, the Quidditch Cup was cancelled due to the Triwizard Tournament.\n**In his fifth year, Harry was banned by Dolores Umbridge after the opening Gryffindor vs. Slytherin match.\n**In his sixth year, Harry was knocked unconscious partway through the second match of the season against Hufflepuff, and then held in detention for the final match against Ravenclaw.\n**In what would have been his seventh year, he didn't attend Hogwarts due to his quest to destroy the Horcruxes.\n*Harry is portrayed by [[Great Britain|British]] actor [[Daniel Radcliffe]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]] of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Chamber of Secrets]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Half-Blood Prince]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|Deathly Hallows: Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Part 2]]'' and so is one of the 14 characters to appear in all 8 film adaptations. By the time ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Deathly Hallows: Part 2]]'' was released, Radcliffe had played the role for ten years consecutively.\n**Harry has green eyes, but in the films he has blue eyes. This is due to the fact that Daniel Radcliffe was allergic to the contact lenses. Radcliffe also has brown hair, as opposed to Harry's black hair, and also has a strong physical body, rather than the slim frame Harry is described as having. However Harry is only described as having an uncommonly 'slim' frame in the earlier instalments, so it is possible that he bulked out a little into a lean frame as he matured.\n**The first actor to be cast as Harry was actually American actor [[imdb:nm0014582|Liam Aiken]],{{fact}} but he lost the part the next day, allegedly because he wasn't British.\n**Daniel Radcliffe never provided voice-acting for any of the [[Harry Potter video games|''Harry Potter'' video games]].

He tells this to Mr Ollivander in {{PS}}. He is also seen writing with this hand throughout the film series.\n*Several undisclosed theories suggest that, as per the prophecy, Voldemort was the only one capable of killing Harry. Meaning that, with Voldemort dead, Harry cannot be killed, though he can presumably still die of natural causes.\n**Still, in {{CC}}, Harry was killed by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] in an alternate universe.\n*Several times throughout Cursed Child, Harry has been called \"savior of the wizarding world\", it is unknown whether this is a given title or an alias that has been given to Harry in his older age. Although, this places Harry higher in respect than Dumbledore, in his defeat of an internationally wanted wizard.\n*In the whole ''Harry Potter'' series, Harry has only called Draco Malfoy by just his first name two times.\n**The first time was when they were in detention in the Forbidden Forest in their first year.\n**The second and last time he called Draco Malfoy by his first name was during the final duel with Voldemort in the Great Hall, when Harry talked about the mastery of the Elder wand. He said that Voldemort wasn't the master of the Elder Wand, Draco was.\n*While Harry repeatedly states [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] is the best student in his year in all classes, he likely simply meant she is the best student ''overall'', for he has beaten her in two of the three Defence Against the Dark Arts exams they had together, with Hermione only beating him in their first year exam.\n**In addition, Rowling has said that Harry could have beaten Hermione in a magical duel halfway through ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]]''.<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0700-swns-alfie.htm Q: If Harry had a magic duel with Hermione, who would win?]</ref> Part of this can be put down to [[Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]]'s way of teaching, which preferred practical lessons over theory, as it seemed to help bring out Harry's own talent at the subject.\n*Harry's birthday of 31 July is also the birthday of ''Harry Potter'' author [[J. K. Rowling]] and actor [[Richard Griffiths]], who played Harry's uncle [[Vernon Dursley]] in the ''Harry Potter'' films.\n**In addition to Rowling and Griffiths, Harry's star sign [[Leo]], a lion, also the sign of the Gryffindor house, was shared by Ginny and Harry's portrayer Daniel Radcliffe, who was born on 23 July.\n**On his famous wizard card shown in {{PS|G}}, Harry's year of birth was not given, instead question marks were shown, indicating his year of birth may not have been made public in the wizarding world.\n*In {{PS|FA}}, despite Harry's birthday being on July 31st in the books, it seems that it was moved to August 31st, because Hagrid first met Harry in the [[Hut-on-the-Rock|shack]] on the day of Harry's birthday, then he took Harry to Diagon Alley and then to King's Cross the next day, where Harry took the Hogwarts Express.\n*In {{POA|FA}}, Harry is seen practising [[Lumos Maxima]] under the covers in his bedroom, but Harry does not get a letter from the [[Improper Use of Magic Office]] even though he is under-age, however, judging by the book he is reading, his reason for doing so is most likely for homework. In the book he is simply using a torch while writing his homework for [[History of Magic]].\n*A running gag in the books is the messiness of Harry's hair. In the films, this is not mentioned except for a reference in the fourth film. Harry notices that Hagrid has combed his hair so he will look good for [[Olympe Maxime]]. When Harry says to him, ''\"Hagrid, have you combed your hair?!\"'' Hagrid states, ''\"As a matter of fact, I have. You might wanna try the same thing now and again\".''\n*In {{HBP|FA}}, Harry tells Dumbledore at the train station that he likes riding around on trains as it takes his mind off things.\n*In {{DH|F2}}, Ginny and Neville are both climbing up on one of the staircases, and run into Harry during the battle. Neville ask Harry if he has seen [[Luna Lovegood]], then he confesses to Ginny and Harry that he as feelings for Luna, he went away to find and tell her. Harry and Ginny share a quick kiss, Harry was going to tell Ginny that he loved her, but Ginny quickly told him that she knows, and they both went back to what they were doing before they met up. This did not happen in {{DH}} book.\n*In ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2: Behind the Magic'', the person who makes all the wands for the films revealed that Dan has gone through over 80 wands over the course of the ten years because he drums with them.\n*In a deleted scene of {{DH|F1}}, when he is disguised as [[Albert Runcorn]], Harry calls [[Arthur Weasley]] by his first name. This is the only time Harry does this.\n*In the films:\n**Harry is shown to wear the colour blue in nearly all his clothing. It could possibly connect with the symbolic meanings of the colour to be that of; trust, wisdom, loyalty, confidence, intelligence, faith, truth and heaven. These particular attributes are significantly linked to Harry's personality throughout the series.\n**Harry's hair grows longer and longer (the longest point was in ''Goblet of Fire'') until it was cut for ''Order of the Phoenix''. It has since grown to about the same length as it was for ''Prisoner of Azkaban''.\n**[[Harry Potter's scars|Harry's scar]] is off-centre on his forehead; this was apparently done at J. K. Rowling's request: because of the books' artwork, many fans believe the scar is in the centre of his head. But it is never explicitly mentioned where the scar is located. On all the U.S. book covers (illustrations), the scar on Harry's forehead is located in the centre. The same is definitely true of the last two U.K. instalments; however, on early U.K. book covers, Harry's scar tends to appear slightly off-centre. It is somewhat hard to tell on most of these covers, as Harry's face is only visible in profile. However, on the U.K. cover of ''Chamber of Secrets'', Harry's scar is decidedly off-centre. It is perhaps of this book that Rowling was thinking.[[File:Lego2 05 Harry Potter.jpg|150px|thumb|Harry Potter in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]\n[[File:Harry-lego y 5-7.jpg|150px|thumb|Harry Potter in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]\n*A variant of Harry is available in the \"Downloadable Character Pack\" {{w|Downloadable content|DLC}} for {{LEGO|Y2}}. The variant is called \"Harry (Yule Ball)\" because it portrays Harry wearing the [[Harry Potter's dress robes|dress robes]] he wore to the [[Yule Ball]].\n*Harry has the last line in many of the books, and if not, he makes the last gesture.\n**''\"I'm going to have a lot of fun with [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] this summer.\"'' [[Philosopher's Stone|(PS)]]\n**''\"All those times I could've died and I didn't'' ''manage it?

Though it could be debatable on whether he has the last line of the second film since the closed captions say that Dean said, \"Yes!\", so he may have had the last line.\n**''\"I'm not going home...not really..\"'' ([[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|PS/SS]])\n**''\"There's no [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] without you, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]].\"'' ([[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|CS]])\n**''\"[[Wand-Lighting Charm|Lumos]].

It has to be his choice. The whole thing's his choice. He chooses to sacrifice himself just as Lily chose to sacrifice herself. He chooses to pull himself back to life, and that's his own will and courage. So ultimately, those things, all of them were more important than the magic.<ref name=\"Pottercast\"/>\n*J.K.
