Spent two days in the [[Hospital Wing]] recovering.|Pamela talking about [[Harry Potter]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)}}\n\nPamela belonged to [[Ravenclaw|her house]]'s [[Duelling Club]]. One day she duelled Harry Potter and was defeated by him. The blow was so powerful that she spent two days in the [[Hospital Wing]]. She was a fan of [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] and wrote quite a few [[Pamela Alton's letters to Gilderoy Lockhart|letters to him]].<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Pamela was invented in the late 16th century by the poet Sir Philip Sidney for use in his poem 'Arcadia'. He possibly intended it to mean \"all sweetness\" from Greek \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd (pan) \"all\" and \u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9 (meli) \"honey\". It was later employed by author Samuel Richardson for the heroine in his novel 'Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded' (1740), after which time it became used as a given name. It did not become popular until the 20th century.<ref>http://www.behindthename.com/name/pamela</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*This particular student was only featured in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|console versions]] of {{POA}} and the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|Nintendo DS and PSP versions]] of {{HBP}}.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{1st}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{Comment|NDS & PSPS versions only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Alton, Pamela}}\n[[fr:Pamela Alton]]\n[[pl:Pamela Alton]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:Alton family]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Duelling Club members]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Gilderoy Lockhart's fans]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
