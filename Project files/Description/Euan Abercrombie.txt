As he was first in his year alphabetically, he was the first to be sorted, and was sorted into [[Gryffindor]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]].<ref name=\"OOTP11\">{{OOTP|B|11}}</ref> He was a small boy with prominent ears, who often looked terrified.<ref name=\"OOTP11\" /> He appeared to believe in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'s'' [[Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter|smear campaign against]] [[Harry Potter]], as he looked at him fearfully when Harry tried to smile at him.<ref name=\"OOTP11\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n\"Abercrombie\" is a surname of Celtic or [[Gaelic]] origin. It comes from the name of a parish in Fife, [[Scotland]], on the northern shore of the Firth of Forth, whence the possessor took his surname; from ''Aber'', marshy ground, a place where two or more streams meet; and ''cruime'' or ''crombie'', a bend or crook. Aber, in the Celtic and Gaelic, and also in the Cornish British, signifies the confluence of two or more streams, or the mouth of a river, where it flows into the sea; hence it is often applied to marshy ground, generally near the confluence of two rivers. It also signifies, sometimes, a gulf or whirlpool. \"Euan\" is of Scottish and Gaelic origin, and it means \"born of yew\" or \"youth\". It also means \"little swift one\" in Irish Gaelic.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n===Translations===\n*Chinese (Simplified): ''\u5c24\u5b89\u00b7\u963f\u4f2f\u514b\u9f99\u6bd4''\n*Chinese (Traditional): ''\u5c24\u5b89\u00b7\u611b\u6ce2''\n*Croatian: ''Euan Abercombie''\n*Dutch: ''Eelco Abeel''\n*Greek: ''\u0393\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03b1\u03bd \u0391\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9''\n*Hebrew: ''\u05d9\u05d5\u05d0\u05df \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05de\u05d1\u05d9''\n*Japanese: ''\u30e6\u30fc\u30a2\u30f3\u30fb\u30a2\u30af\u30ed\u30d0\u30f3\u30d3\u30fc''\n*Lithuanian: ''Juanas Aberkrombis''\n*Norwegian: ''Johan Abelin''\n*Russian: ''\u042e\u0430\u043d \u0410\u0431\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0438 {{c|Yuan Aberkrombi}}''\n*Serbian: ''\u0408\u0443\u0430\u043d \u0410\u0431\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0438 {{c|Juan Aberkrombi}}''\n*Ukrainian: ''\u042e\u0430\u043d \u0410\u0431\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0456 {{c|Yuan Aberkrombi}}''\nThe following languages are the same as the original:\n{|\n|\n*Afrikaans\n*Czech\n|\n*Danish\n*Faroese\n|\n*Finnish\n*French\n|\n*German\n*Polish\n|\n*Portuguese\n*Spanish\n|\n*Swedish\n|}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{OOTP}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Abercrombie, Euan}}\n[[de:Euan Abercrombie]]\n[[fr:Euan Abercrombie]]\n[[pl:Euan Abercrombie]]\n[[ru:\u042e\u0430\u043d \u0410\u0431\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0438]]\n[[zh:\u5c24\u5b89\u00b7\u963f\u4f2f\u514b\u9f99\u6bd4]]\n[[Category:1980s births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1995]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
