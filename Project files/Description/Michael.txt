Upon arriving at Hogwarts, Michael was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]] [[Hogwarts Houses|house]].<ref name=\"OOTPF\"/>\n\nDuring the [[1995\u20131996 school year]], [[Fred and George Weasley]] comforted him after [[Dolores Umbridge]] made him use a [[Black Quill|blood quill]] to write lines after he was caught pulling a rebellious prank on Umbridge, telling him that his wounds were already healing, and that the pain would eventually go away. Shortly after this, he was joined by [[Harry Potter]] in the courtyard when Umbridge turned up, because it was then that the Weasley twins decided to put their [[Fred and George Weasley's departure from Hogwarts|plan of escape]] into action, a plan that Michael witnessed and supported.<ref name=\"OOTPF\">{{OOTP|F}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Michael comes from the Hebrew Mikha-el, meaning \"Who is like God?\"<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/michael Behind The Name - Michael]</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Michael has only appeared in {{OOTP|FA}}. There was no mention about him in the book.\n*Michael may have been a member of Dumbledore's Army to have served detention using the Blood Quill in the film adaptation, as all members listed on Dumbledore's Army's parchment were punished as a group. There were, however, multiple other reasons to serve detention, seeing as in the film adaptation Umbridge and the Ministry passed at least one-hundred and thirty-six [[Educational Decree]]s.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Michael}}\n*{{OOTP|F}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[de:Michael]]\n[[es:Michael]]\n[[fr:Michael]]\n[[pl:Michael]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0430\u0439\u043a\u043b]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Brown-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
