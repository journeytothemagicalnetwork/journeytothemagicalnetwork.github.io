In detention, he befriended Jacob's sibling and gave one of three items to them for free. Afterward, the two went to study in the [[Hogwarts Library]] along with [[Rowan Khanna]], [[Tulip Karasu]], and [[Barnaby Lee]] to figure out what kind of [[spell]] could have caused [[Beatrice Haywood]] to get stuck in a [[portrait]]. After the group came to the conclusion that it was due to an [[Extension Charm|Undetectable Extension Charm]], Jae shocked the rest by knowing about the regulations of the [[charm]].<ref name=\"HM53\">{{HM|5|3}}</ref>\n\nJae earned at least nine<ref>{{HM}}, adding to the seven O.W.L.s already listed in the other source, he is also shown attending N.E.W.T. level [[Divination (class)|Divination]] and [[Astronomy (class)|Astronomy]] classes.</ref> [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]]: he achieved an [[Acceptable]] mark in [[Charms (class)|Charms]], [[Potions (class)|Potions]], [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]], [[Care of Magical Creatures]], [[Herbology]], and [[History of Magic]], an [[Outstanding]] in [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]<ref name=\"OWLS\">{{HM}} {{see image|File:Jae Kim O.W.L. results.png}}</ref>, and an unknown mark in [[Divination (class)|Divination]] and [[Astronomy (class)|Astronomy]]. Sometime during the year, he became a founding member of the [[Circle of Khanna]], a group devoted to avenging [[Rowan Khanna]] and locating the final [[Cursed Vaults|cursed vault]]. It was at the groups first meeting in the [[Hog's Head Inn]] that he learned of the malevolent organisation \"[[R]]\" and it's [[Plot to find the Cursed Vaults|motives]] to locate the final Cursed Vault before them.<ref name=\"HM620\"/>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nJae Kim was a notorious and easy-going rule-breaker who sold a contraband of banned items during his time at Hogwarts. He shared similar perspectives on rules with fellow trouble-maker [[Tulip Karasu]], but while Tulip enjoyed breaking the rules, Jae preferred to work his way around them. He was shown to be intensely dedicated to his bootlegging operations, only caring about selling his illegal wares, and not at all what his customers did with them, thus making him the most amoral of all of [[Jacob's sibling]]'s friends. The full extent of his opportunism became apparent during the [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]], when he sold desperate students items they could cheat on the exams with, with Jae failing to mention that they were very likely to get caught and thus ruin any future career prospects. He was an indolent individual, despising having to study or do any physical work and preferring to take the easy road instead.\n\nDespite his faults, however, Jae was ultimately shown to be a good-natured and loyal friend, going out of his way to aid Jacob's sibling in the latter's quest for the [[Cursed Vaults]]. He also appeared to be more intelligent than he let on, being able to achieve an '[[Outstanding]]' on his [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] O.W.L. and to recognise the charm that cursed [[Beatrice Haywood]] as an [[Extension Charm|Undetectable Extension Charm]].\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Jae was very adept in this field, as he achieved an '[[Outstanding]]' in his [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] exam, and proceeded to continue studying the subject at [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level.\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Jae was skilled with charm-work. He had some mastery over some duelling charms like the [[Disarming Charm]], the [[Tickling Charm]], the [[Freezing Charm]]. He also achieved an O.W.L in this [[Charms (class)|subject]].
