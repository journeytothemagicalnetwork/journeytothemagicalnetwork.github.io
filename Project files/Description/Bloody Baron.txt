In the video games, however, the Baron resumes his \"book\" persona.\n*In all of his media appearances, the Bloody Baron appears in late seventeenth century attire. This wardrobe was chosen for {{PS|FA}}, when the Baron's death date was uncertain. This, of course, is not consistent with {{DH}}, in which he is revealed to have died in the eleventh century.\n**His epithet, the Bloody Baron, is also an anachronism, as feudalism was not introduced in the British Isles until after the Norman conquest in 1066, and therefore there were no barons until this time (unless he died shortly after the conquest). This is probably explained by it, along with Helena Ravenclaw's title of 'the Grey Lady', and the Fat Friar, being a nickname he acquired later on.\n*In {{PS|FA}}, the Bloody Baron resembles Captain James Hook (as played by Dustin Hoffman) in the film ''Hook''. Coincidentally, that film features [[Maggie Smith]], who plays [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], as well as a music score by [[John Williams]].\n*The Baron is encountered in the PC/Mac version of ''Philosopher's Stone'' walking the labyrinthine dungeon corridors where [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] sends [[Harry Potter]] to find four crucial [[potion]] ingredients. In the next generation version of Chamber of Secrets, the Baron can be seen walking the path from the dungeons through the entrance hall to the teacher's lounge corridor, every night, the chilling sound of his footsteps echoing through the hall each time as he approaches.\n*In the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|video game version]] of {{COS}}, it is mentioned he cannot speak.\n*In the credits of {{PS|FA}}, his name is misspelt as \"Bloody Barron\".\n*In the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|PS2 version of the video game adaptation]] of {{POA}}, there is a large statue of the Bloody Baron on the [[North Wing]].\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of the Bloody Baron}}\n*{{PS}} {{1st}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{PS|F}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{PS|G}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{COS}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{COS|G}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{POA|G}} {{Statue}}\n*{{GOF}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{OOTP}} {{Mention}}\n*{{OOTP|G}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{HBP}} {{Mention}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{Mention}}\n*{{DH}} {{Mention}}\n*{{PM}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{WW}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}} {{Ghost}} {{C|Consoles and PC versions}}\n*{{HPV|CH}} {{Mention}}\n*{{HM}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{WU}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{MA}} {{Ghost}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogwarts}}\n{{Hogwarts below ground floor}}\n[[de:Der Blutige Baron]]\n[[es:Bar\u00f3n Sanguinario]]\n[[fr:Baron Sanglant]]\n[[ru:\u041a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0411\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043d]]\n[[fi:Verinen paroni]]\n[[it:Barone Sanguinario]]\n[[nl:Bloederige Baron]]\n[[pl:Krwawy Baron]]\n[[sv:Blodige Baronen]]\n[[Category:11th century deaths]]\n[[Category:Black-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Deaths by stabbing]]\n[[Category:Deaths by suicide]]\n[[Category:Foundables]]\n[[Category:Ghosts]]\n[[Category:Historical figures]]\n[[Category:Impersonated individuals]]\n[[Category:Killed by Bloody Baron]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Murderers]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Portraits]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Statues]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
