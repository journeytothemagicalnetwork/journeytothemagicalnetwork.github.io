Flora was also the name of a Roman fertility goddess whose domain was flowers, Spring, and youth. This goddess was not of Greek origin, unlike many Roman gods, instead coming from the lore of the Italic Sabine folk.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*This character is only introduced in {{HBP|FA}} and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Part 2]]'' of {{DH}}.\n*Flora Carrow is portrayed by actress [[Amber and Ruby Evans|Amber Evans]].<ref name=\"SnitchSeekerCarrowTwins\" />\n*Both she and her sister [[Hestia Carrow|Hestia]] were likely invited to join the [[Slug Club]] due to their pure-blood heritage (and perhaps a devotion to Slytherin House, possibly indicated by their fondness for green). The Carrow family are one of the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]], meaning they are one of the twenty-eight pure-blooded families left in Great Britain.\n*It is likely that the Carrow twins are related to [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow]], as all four of them have Greco-Roman forenames and the same surname.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Flora and Hestia Carrow}}\n*{{HBP|F}} {{1st}}\n*{{DH|F1}}\n*{{DH|F2}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}} {{C|As \"Slytherin Twin #1\"}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Carrow, Flora}}\n\n[[de:Flora Carrow]]\n[[fr:Flora Carrow]]\n[[pl:Flora Carrow]]\n[[ru:\u0424\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u041a\u044d\u0440\u0440\u043e\u0443]]\n[[ja:\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fb\u30ab\u30ed\u30fc]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:Blue-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Carrow family|Flora]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Grey-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Slug Club]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Twins]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
