[[24 February]],<ref name=\"birthdate\" /> [[1897]])<ref name=\"FB\" /> was an [[England|English]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], famed [[Magizoologist]] and the author of {{FB}}. Early in life, Scamander developed an interest in magical [[creature]]s, influenced by his [[Scamander brothers' mother|mother]]'s breeding of [[hippogriff]]s. He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where he was sorted into [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]]. While at Hogwarts he was sentenced to expulsion, though [[Albus Dumbledore]], who had been his [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] instructor, recognised his innocence, and objected strongly.\n\nScamander joined the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], spending two years in the [[Office for House-Elf Relocation]] before joining the [[Beast Division]]. In [[1918]] he was commissioned by [[Augustus Worme]] of [[Obscurus Books]] to write ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them''. The book became a best-seller, making Scamander a respected expert in the field of [[Magizoology]]. He became heavily involved in the [[Global wizarding war]], where he bonded with [[Porpentina Goldstein]] and defied [[Gellert Grindelwald]] on three [[Obscurial attack on New York|different]] [[Gellert Grindelwald's Paris rally|occasions]]. He married Goldstein and they had at least one child.<ref name=\"child\" /> By the beginning of the 1990s, he was retired and living in [[Dorset]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life {{C|1897\u20131908}}===\nNewton Artemis Fido \"Newt\" Scamander was born on [[24 February]]<ref name=\"birthdate\" /> [[1897]]<ref name=\"FB\" /> somewhere in [[England]].<ref name=\"english\" /> He had at least one sibling, an older brother, [[Theseus Scamander]].<ref name=\"FB60\" /> He developed an interest in magical creatures at an early age, as his [[Scamander brothers' mother|mother]] was a breeder of [[hippogriff]]s.

Newt was also in the cupboard nursing a [[raven]] chick.

Newt's Boggart took the form of an office desk, as Newt feared the idea of being forced to work in an office job for his future career. By casting the Boggart-Banishing Spell, he changed the desk into a mechanical [[dragon]], for which Professor Dumbledore praised him.\n\n[[File:Newt showing Leta the Bowtruckles.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Newt showing Leta a Bowtruckle at [[Bowtruckle Island]]]]\nHe later comforted Leta when she was upset by her own Boggart, which was of her dead half-brother [[Corvus Lestrange (V)|Corvus Lestrange]]. By then, he had befriended the [[Bowtruckle]]s on the school grounds at [[Bowtruckle Island]] and gained their trust. He was the only one they would not hide from, and he studied their social lives. \n\nNewt was once given a month's detention for telling a Hogwarts employee by the name of [[Prendergast]] that \"there are no strange creatures, only blinkered people\", when the latter critically questioned his interest in magical creatures. Leta then let off a [[Dungbomb]] under the desk of the teacher to join him.\n\nIn [[1913]], one of Leta's experiments involving a [[Jarvey]] went too far, endangering the life of another student.<ref name=\"handbook-newt\" /><ref name=\"expulsion\">{{CB}} {{See image|File:Newt's Explusion.jpg}}</ref> It also violated laws prohibiting the possession of this creature.<ref name=\"expulsion\" /> Rather than seeing his good friend expelled, Newt took the blame for Leta's actions, and was thus sentenced to be expelled from Hogwarts in her place.<ref name=\"handbook-newt\" /><ref name=\"jkr-snitchseeker\">\"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrbhgaBakwE&feature=youtu.be EXCLUSIVE: J.K.

Thus, it cannot be conclusively determined whether Newt was actually expelled at this point, as it is not known which canon supersedes the other. It is possible that J. K. Rowling's statements that Newt was expelled were a deliberate attempt at withholding information to prevent spoilers.</ref> However, he was allowed to keep his wand.<ref name=\"jkr-snitchseeker\" />\n\n===Ministry employee {{C|1914\u20131918}}===\n[[File:MinistyEmployeeNewtScamanderWU.png|250px|thumb|Newt while working at the Ministry]]\nSometime during the [[First World War]] from [[1914]] to [[1918]], Scamander served on the [[Eastern Front]] in a confidential [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] programme to wrangle [[Ukrainian Ironbelly]]s.

Intrigued, Newton pushed his way closer to the woman, accidentally brushing against an ex-[[Auror]] named [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]] as he did so. Moments later [[Jacob Kowalski]], a [[Non-magic people|No-Maj]] with a case full of confectionery, bumped into him, falling over Scamander's magical suitcase. Newt helped him up, and Jacob went to the bank. The confusion around Scamander caught Mary Lou's attention. Unaware that Newt was a wizard, Mary Lou spoke directly to him, asking if he was a [[seeker]] of truth, to which Newt replied that he was a more of a [[chaser]]. When she asked him if he was ready to follow her and her organisation, Newt noticed that a [[Niffler]] escaped from his suitcase, so he moved to the bank, with Tina following him out of curiosity.\n\n[[File:FB-JB-newt&jacob.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Newt and Jacob watching the hatching Occamy]]\nWhile searching the creature, Scamander exchanged a few sentences with Kowalski, learning about his aim to get a loan so he could start a bakery. When he noticed the Niffler robbing people and moved toward it, he unintentionally left behind an [[occamy egg]]. Kowalski picked it up, intending to give it back to the wizard. However before he could do this, he was called to talk about a loan with [[Gilbert Bingley]]. While Jacob discussed his loan, Newt was still chasing the Niffler, which jumped onto the cart to the elevator. When Jacob left the office, showing Newt the cracking egg, Scamander attracted Kowalski to himself using the [[Summoning Charm]], after which he disapparated with him to the entrance of the bank's vault. Newt then put the newly-hatched [[Occamy]] into a suitcase, calming down the other animals as he did so. When Newt used the [[Unlocking Charm]] to get to the vault in which his [[Niffler]] had hidden, both men were discovered by Mr Bingley, who inferred that they were going to rob the bank, and activated the alarm. In response, Newt quickly immobilised him with the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] and shook the Niffler, emptying it of the stolen money and gold. Before the armed guards entered the room, Newt [[Apparition|Disapparated]] himself with the shocked Jacob to the street near the bank.\n\n[[File:NewtTinaGraves-WandPermitOffice.jpg|250px|thumb|Newt with Tina and Graves]]\nAfter throwing the Niffler into the suitcase, Newt apologised to Jacob for his antics, and took out [[Newton Scamander's wand|his wand]] with the intention of [[Memory Charm|removing his unwanted memories]]. However, before he could do this, Kowalski knocked the wizard to the ground with his case and fled. Newt tried to follow Jacob, but Tina came round the corner at the same time and, grabbing his elbow, she disapparated them to a narrow street in front of the bank. Unnerved by what she had witnessed, Tina showed Newt her old [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]] ID card, letting him think she was \"some kind of investigator\", and after questioning him on why he let the creature run free, and why he did not obliviate the [[Non-magic people|No-Maj]], she grabbed Newt again and apparated with him near the [[Woolworth Building]]. When they entered, the building magically transformed into the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|headquarters of MACUSA]]. Newt told Tina that the reason for his visit to the [[United States of America|United States]] was the purchase of an [[Appaloosa Puffskein]], and Tina explained in response that there was a [[Ban on Experimental Breeding]] in New York and they had shut down the Appaloosa Puffskein breeder some time before. When they took the elevator to the [[Major Investigation Department]], Goldstein tried to present Newt as a suspicious character in the middle of a meeting about the attack of an unidentified beast in the city, but [[Seraphina Picquery]], President of MACUSA, firmly dismissed the two. Later in the [[Wand Permit Office]] where Tina was working, she asked Newt whether he has permission for a wand, but he only said that he applied for it by letter. When [[Percival Graves]], the Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement (MACUSA)|Department of Magical Law Enforcement]], entered the cabinet, Tina told him about the events in the bank, then opened the suitcase, which supposedly belonged to Scamander - but after seeing that it contained cakes belonging to Kowalski, it became clear that Newt had accidentally taken Jacob's case instead of his own. MACUSA no longer took them seriously, but Newt and Tina realised that in the ensuing chaos of trying catch a Niffler, Kowalski must have taken the case containing the creature. Newt immediately decided to find Kowalski.\n\nWhile looking for Kowalski, Newt and Tina saw a [[Billywig]] flying over their heads and a crowd of people in front of the destroyed building. Newt realised that Jacob had accidentally opened the suitcase and several creatures must have escaped, turning a small mix-up into an incident of major proportions (as magical and non-magical relations in the United States were already frail, due in part to the presence of a Muggle fanatical extremist group, containing the incident would require the intervention of MACUSA). When a drunken tramp said to a police officer that the reason of the disaster was not gas, but the huge [[hippopotamus]]-like animal, Scamander obliviated him. While the tramp joined the people insisting there had been a gas explosion, Newt ran into the damaged building. In one of the rooms, he saw the effects of his beasts: there were traces of paws, broken furniture, broken glass, a hole in the wall, an opened suitcase and Kowalski himself having been bitten by one of the creatures. Newt quickly [[Mending Charm|repaired]] Jacob's apartment. When Tina entered the room, Newt found a [[Murtlap]] and put him into the suitcase, and tried again to erase Jacob's memory. Tina did not let this happen, explaining that they now needed him as a witness, but as Jacob showed signs of injury, Tina grabbed both men and disapparated, unaware that a Niffler was still there.\n\n[[File:Extension charm.gif|250px|thumb|left|Newt climbing into his case]]\nNewt with Jacob were brought by Tina to [[679 West 24th Street|her apartment]] and introduced them to her sister, [[Queenie Goldstein]], who eagerly cooked a meal for them[[Queenie Goldstein|.]] After dinner, when Tina showed them to a room they could sleep in and left them alone, Newt went inside his suitcase and took Jacob with him, where he prepared him an antidote for the Murtlap's bite and showed him rest of his creatures. Due too Newt's need to retrieve all the escaped creatures, they left the suitcase and decided to head to [[Central Park]] and find Newt's missing [[Erumpent]].\n\n[[File:Glass to jelly spell.gif|250px|thumb|Newt catching Niffler]]\nHowever, after leaving the Goldsteins' apartment, Newt spotted his Niffler behind a window of the jewellery store. He used the [[Finestra spell|Finestra]] spell to shatter the glass and get inside. Newt furiously attempted to capture the Niffler, falling through the other window in the process. Subsequently, they were confronted by a squad of policemen, who were puzzled by the sight of the Niffler. Jacob then directed their attention to a lion wandering right by them, giving him and Newt the opportunity to disapparate from the street.\n\n[[File:Newt catching Erumpent.gif|250px|thumb|left|Newt and Jacob catching Erumpent]]\nWhile in Central Park they passed an [[ostrich]]. After Scamander's predictions of Erumpent current location, they headed to the [[Central Park Zoo]]. When Newt saw a hippopotamus backed up into a corner by the Erumpent, he provided Jacob with a helmet and vest to protect himself from the Erumpent and left him to hold a vial of [[Erumpent musk]] while he performed a mating dance to lure the creature back into his suitcase. Unfortunately, Jacob accidentally spilled musk on himself when he was hit by a fish thrown by an escaped [[seal]], prompting the Erumpent to chase him out of the zoo and onto the frozen park pond before Newt managed to force it back into the suitcase.\n\n====Evading MACUSA====\n[[File:Newt Tina Jacob arrested.gif|250px|thumb|Newt is arrested and his case is confiscated]]\nHowever, when they climbed back into the suitcase under a bridge in the park, Tina, who had followed them, locked them in and took them to the MACUSA headquarters. Before she interrupted a delegation of the [[International Confederation of Wizards]] to inform them about the creatures and the wizard who smuggled them into the country, [[Henry Shaw Junior|Senator Henry Shaw Jnr]] has been killed. Newt was immediately blamed for allowing one of his creatures to murder a No-Maj. Newt, observing the scars and markings on Shaw's body projection, stated that only an [[Obscurus]] could have left the distinct markings upon his body, which caused unrest in the room, during which President Picquery denied the existence of any [[Obscurial]] in [[United States of America|America]]. Newt, Tina and Jacob were soon taken under arrest by Percival Graves and Newt's case was impounded. In the jail cell, Newt and Tina explained to Jacob the meaning of an Obscurus and how no record existed at the time of an Obscurial having existed past the age of ten.\n\n[[File:Gellert-and-Newt.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Newt being interrogated by Percival Graves]]\nAfter discovering by Graves the harmless Obscurus that Newt brought to New York in the suitcase, during an interrogation, Newt was blamed by him for the actions of an particularly powerful Obscurus which killed Senator[[Henry Shaw Junior|.]] Scamander was also accused by him for letting the animals [[For the Greater Good]], in an attempt to begin a war. Newt's protests have done nothing and he was sentenced to death, as well as Tina. When they were brought to the [[Death cell]] and Tina was strapped into a chair with her memories extracted and casted into [[death potion]] under the chair, Newt freed himself with the help of his [[Bowtruckle]], [[Pickett]], which picked the lock on his handcuffs. Newt released then a [[Swooping Evil]] to attack [[executioner]]s and rescue Tina. During their escape from MACUSA they were pursued by several Aurors defeated by Newt's Swooping Evil. They bumped into Jacob and Queenie, who managed to free the No-Maj from [[Obliviator]] and get Newt's suitcase from [[Percival Graves's office|Graves' office]]. Newt and others climbed into it, and Queenie walked out of MACUSA headquarters with it.\n\n[[File:Newt and Tina at Blind Pig.jpg|250px|thumb|Newt with Tina in the Blind Pig]]\nHaving two more beasts to catch, Newt had a problem with locating one, which most of the time was invisible. Tina came up with an idea to took everyone to the [[The Blind Pig|Blind Pig]] to meet [[Gnarlak]], the [[Goblin]] who secretly traded magical creatures. Newton offered him some [[galleon]]s, [[lunascope]] and freeze [[Ashwinder egg]], but Pickett caught goblin's attention. Newt was reluctant to the exchange, but agreed, as a result he received the information that he was looking for, that he should look around [[Macy's]] department store. After Gnarlak's betrayal and MACUSA Aurors apparition Jacob [[Muggle duelling|punched]] the goblin. This allowed Newt to take Pickett and disapparate with Jacob and Goldstein sisters away from the pub.\n\n[[File:Newt catching Occamy.gif|250px|thumb|left|Newt and Tina catching Occamy]]\nHeading to the selected destination, Scamander and others found at [[Ginzberg Delaunay]] Newt's [[Demiguise]], [[Dougal]] stealing things for an immensely sized Occamy. After some complications, like accidentally kicking a Christmas ornament by Queenie, Newt entrapped the Occamy with the help of Tina holding a teapot held and Jacob throwing a cockroach inside the dish.\n\n====Obscurial attack on New York City====\nFinally packing Demiguise and Occamy to the suitcase and bringing an end to the search for creatures, Newt and friends headed to the rooftop of the building, where they saw an Obscurus flying across [[Manhattan]]. Newt gave Tina his suitcase and Disapparated to save the Obscurial, but Tina handed the suitcase to Queenie and Jacob so she could join Newt.\n\n[[File:Newt-Apparating.gif|250px|thumb|Newt Apparates to save Credence]]\nWhen Newt saw Graves hunting Obscurus on the destroyed street, he deduced that the Obscurial was actually [[Credence Barebone]]. Even though Newt was not to blame Credence, Newt's hunt for magical beasts led him on a course to collide with Graves and Credence, and MACUSA was not far behind. Apparating from time to time on one of the rooftops and running in a line with flying Credence, Newt tried to protect him from the Aurors on the roofs trying to kill the Obscurial.\n\n[[File:Newt with Grindelwald.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Newt after capturing Gellert Grindelwald]]\nAfter going by Credence to a subway station, Scamander followed him. After being told the story of the Sudanese girl, Credence let Newt approach him. However, the sudden arrival of Graves failed the whole attempt of calming down Credence. Graves tried to kill Newton with [[Gellert Grindelwald's lightning bolt spell|lightning bolts]], which provoked Credence to resume his Obscurus form. After Tina appeared in the subway and she tried to call him down again, the arrival of President Picquery and the MACUSA Aurors agitated him. They attacked him with many spells, only stopping when they believed he was killed. When shreds of Credence's Obscurus form fled the scene, Graves went on a rant in which Newt deduced who he really was. With the help of the Swooping Evil and Tina, Newt captured Graves and [[Revelio Charm|revealed]] that he was none other than famous [[Dark Wizard]] and international criminal, [[Gellert Grindelwald]], using [[Human Transfiguration]] to assume the identity of MACUSA's employee.<ref>{{FB|S|116}}</ref> While being apprehended by Aurors, Grindelwald met Newt's gaze and mysteriously asked him: \"Will we die, just a little?\".\n\nAfter taking Grindelwald to MACUSA prison, Scamander helped prevent a wide-scale exposure of the wizarding world by employing the help of Frank from his case to create a rain laced with [[Swooping Evil venom]], whose [[Memory Charm|obliviating]] properties erased the bad memories of the Muggle citizens of New York, including his friend [[Jacob Kowalski]].<ref>{{FB|S|118}}</ref>\n\n====Returning to Europe====\n[[File:Newt and Tina's goodbye FBF.jpg|250px|thumb|Newt temporarily says goodbye to his future wife, Tina]]\nOne week later, on [[15 December]], Scamander bumped into Kowalski while he was on his way to his job at the [[Moreton Dale Canning Factory]] and switched suitcases with him, leaving him a collection of silver [[Occamy egg]]shells and [[Newton Scamander's letter to Jacob Kowalski|a letter]] instructing him to use the shells as collateral for a bank loan to start his [[Kowalski Quality Baked Goods|bakery]].<ref>{{FB|S|121}} is a week after Jacob was obliviated on the dawn of 8 December.</ref>\n\nThe next day, on [[16 December]] [[1926]], Tina thanked Newt for saying good things about her to Madam Picquery, which resulted in being restored as an Auror.

Newt had corresponded with her by letter, but he had soured the relationship by his missteps.\n\n[[File:Newt Theseus Leta and Bunty at Flourish and Blotts.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Newt with Leta, Theseus and Bunty during launch in Flourish and Blotts]]\nShortly after the events in New York, between January and March [[1927]], ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'' was published and became a bestseller. It became an approved textbook at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], and, by the mid-1990s, was in its fifty-second edition.<ref name=\"FB\" /> This made Newt famous throughout the wizarding world.<ref name=\"COGS\" /> A [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them book launch party|launch party]] was held on [[19 March]] at [[Flourish and Blotts]] on [[Diagon Alley]], in which magizoologist was accompanied by his childhood friend [[Leta Lestrange]], his older brother [[Theseus Scamander]] and his assistant, [[Bunty]]. He happily signed his fans' personal copies of his book.<ref name=\"image\">{{See image|File:Fantastic-Beasts-book-launch .jpg}}</ref> After the party, [[Spellbound (magazine)|Spellbound]] wrongly declared that Leta was Newt's fianc\u00e9e, when in fact she and Theseus were getting married on [[6 June]] [[1928]]; Newt was supposed to be their best man.\n\n[[File:Newt at the Ministry.jpg|250px|thumb|Newt in the Ministry of Magic]]\nOn [[30 May]] 1927, [[Gellert Grindelwald's escape|Gellert Grindelwald escaped]] while he was being transferred from America to face trial in Europe by [[Head of Incarceration]], [[Rudolph Spielman]] and Aurors. Three months later, Newt head to the Ministry to appeal to have his travel ban revoked for the fifth time. While waiting for his turn he started play with Pickett, until he met Leta, who was there because Theseus had found her a job working as assistant to the Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]], [[Torquil Travers]]. She went to Newt to take him to a meeting with commission, and they spoke about their friendship. Leta revealed that she and Theseus were always inviting Newt to dinner, but Newt always declined. When Theseus came along, he told his brother that he would be more open this time. During commission including, Theseus, Travers, Spielman and [[Arnold Guzman]], US Emissary, they revealed to Newt that Credence Barebone survived and had been sighted in [[Europe]]. They offered to restore Newt's travel rights if he will join the Ministry as an [[Auror]] and will kill the Obscurial. Newt refused and walked out of the meeting, his task was assigned to [[Gunnar Grimmson]]. Approached by Theseus as he was leaving the meeting, his brother told him that eventually he would be forced to choose a side, something Newt refused to do. As Theseus embraced him to say goodbye, he whispered that the Ministry were watching him.<ref name=\"COGS\" />\n\n[[File:Newt with Dumbledore in London.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Dumbledore asking Newt for help in London]]\nAfter leaving the Ministry and fending off [[Stebbins (Auror)|Stebbins]], one of the Ministry's agents in [[Whitehall]] with the [[Windy Spell]], Newt was accosted by a levitating gloved hand which points to a figure standing atop a high building nearby. Seizing the glove, Newt [[Apparition|apparated]] besides the figure, who turned out to be his old Hogwarts teacher, [[Albus Dumbledore]]. Albus, after [[Fogging Spell|creating a fog]] around the city with his [[Albus Dumbledore's wand|wand]] and using the [[deluminator]] on the lamps to avoid being tracked by the Ministry, apparated them near the bus stop. Albus mentioned the rumour that has been circling in [[pure-blood]] circles, that Credence may be the long-lost last member of the [[Lestrange family]], a rumour, which Newt knew was connected to the half-brother of his childhood friend, Leta. Dumbledore, fearless that he can not face Grindelwald himself, asked Newt to go to [[Paris]] to find Credence, giving him the card with address of a safe-house where he can go if he needs to hide for a time. Newt was reluctant to go because of the Ministry's travel ban, the breaking of which would lead him to imprisonment in [[Azkaban]], but still accepted the address, ever ready to do ''the right thing'' if the need arose.\n\n[[File:Newt riding Kelpie0.gif|250px|thumb|Newt riding a Kelpie in the basement of his house]]\nWhen Newt back to his [[9 Sherringford Square|town house]], he found out that baby Nifflers run away from cage. He went downstairs to enlarged basement, where he set up his creatures, to help his assistant [[Bunty]] catch them and fed the large [[kelpie]] living in a large pool based on the appearance of a Scottish loch.<ref name=\"COGS\" /> When they heard the noise Newt ordered Bunty to go home and he went upstairs.\n\n[[File:Surgito.gif|250px|thumb|left|Newt lifting the love charm from Jacob]]\nTo his surprise he got a visit from [[Queenie Goldstein]] and [[Jacob Kowalski]], whose memory has not been completely erased, because the venom of the Swooping Evil removes only bad memories. Queenie informed Newt that Tina was heartbroken, because she read the wrong account in Spellbound of the upcoming marriage between Theseus and Leta, becoming convinced that Newt had patched up his relation with Leta and was ready to marry her, so she had started seeing a fellow Auror named [[Achilles Tolliver]]. When Queenie announced that she and Jacob were engaged and planned to be married, Newt noticed Jacob's odd behaviour and realised he had been enchanted by her, using a powerful [[Entrancing Enchantments|love enchantment]]. After a brief argument Queenie agreed, and Newt [[Surgito|lifted]] the spell. In cause Jacob, fearing that she would be punished for marrying a no-Maj, refused to marry her, so Queenie, feeling betrayed, disapparated to find Tina. Newt [[Papyrus Reparo|fixed]] the postcard Queenie lost and discovered that Tina was in Paris looking for Credence. It was only after learning where Tina was that Newt made the decision to go after Credence himself.\n\n====Visit to Paris====\n[[File:Portkey Dartmoor.gif|250px|thumb|Newt and Jacob using a Portkey]]\nAfter preparation for the journey, Newt, alongside with Jacob, headed to [[Dartmoor]], where Newt gave fifty [[galleon]]s to a [[Unidentified Portkey tout|Portkey tout]], and then he illegally left England for France via a [[Portkey]], hoping to patch up their respective relationships with the Goldstein sisters.\n\n[[File:Newt searching for Tina.gif|250px|thumb|left|Newt searching for Tina]]\nOn one of the Paris streets Newt [[Confundus Charm|confunded]] a guard to allow himself and Jacob to sneak under a [[Moving Statue|Magical Statue]] and move to the [[Place Cach\u00e9e]]. Newt cast a [[tracking spell|Tracking Spell]] to locate Tina and then used a [[Summoning Charm]] on his magical suitcase to take out his Niffler, which looked for some traces. Using the [[Revelio Charm]], Newt detected the presence of a Japanese [[Kappa]] and a Chinese [[Zouwu]] which had managed to escape from [[Circus Arcanus]]. He also detected Tina with a mysterious man, with whom she went to an unknown location. When the Niffler found a feather from the man's hat, Newt took the creature inside the suitcase, and [[Avenseguim|charmed the feather]] allowing him and Jacob to track the man.\n\n[[File:Crimes-of-Grind.jpg|250px|thumb|Newt and Jacob talking with Yusuf]]\nFollowing the feather, the two ended up in a [[Caf\u00e9 Abringer|caf\u00e9]]. There, the French wizard introduced himself to both men as [[Yusuf Kama]]. Newt questioned him about Tina, so Yusuf took them to his [[Yusuf Kama's hideout|hideout]] in one of the [[Yusuf Kama's hideout sewers|Parisian sewers]], where he had in fact imprisoned Tina. Kama did the same with Newt and Jacob and said to Newt that he will not release them until he hunts down Credence Barebone. However, Kama then unexpectedly fainted, so Newt released Pickett to unlock the lock in the gate freeing himself, Tina, and Jacob. They then approached the unconscious Yusuf Kama and heard a powerful roar coming from above.\n\n[[File:Newt catching Zouwu.gif|250px|thumb|left|Newt catching the Zouwu]]\nAfter pulling Kama out from the sewer they headed to the [[Alexander III Bridge]], where Newt confronted the Zouwu. Conjuring up a toy, he caught the beast and returned him into his suitcase. Newt then seized Tina, Jacob and sick Yusuf and [[Apparition|apparated]] them to [[Rue de Montmorency]], where they went to [[Flamel House|Nicolas Flamel's house]], the \"safe house\" address which Dumbledore had given Newt. At the alchemist's home, Newt used [[tweezers]] to pull out a [[water dragon parasite]] from Yusuf's eye which had been weakening him. Newt and Tina then both deduced that traces on Kama's hands showed that he made an [[Unbreakable Vow]].\n\n====Infiltration of the French Ministry of Magic====\n[[File:Newt disguised as Theseus.jpg|250px|thumb|Newt disguised as Theseus entering the French Ministry of Magic with Tina]]\nAfter a brief and rushed \"goodbye\", Tina left Flamel's house to find Credence, but Newt was told by [[Jacob Kowalski]] to chase after her. Newt tried to apologise for what he said about [[Auror]]s but Tina remained unimpressed. While on a [[Rue de Montmorency|street]], Tina and Newt saw [[Gellert Grindelwald]] [[Gellert Grindelwald's dark banners|calling]] his followers to get ready for his [[Gellert Grindelwald's Paris rally|Paris rally]]. Then Newt came to the conclusion that he should go with Tina to the [[French Ministry of Magic Headquarters|French Ministry of Magic]] to find a [[Lestrange family tree box|box]], which would tell them who Credence really was. Soon after, to get into the Ministry without being recognised, he drank [[polyjuice potion]] containing Theseus's hair, allowing him to temporarily take his brother's form. When the potion ceased to work and Newt was reverted to his true form, they were discovered by Theseus, who happened to actually be in Paris in a delegation, including Leta and Travers, due to the rumours of Newt's potential trip to Paris. He chased them, but Tina stunned him and tied him up to a chair - to Newt's joy, who said that might have been the best moment of his life.\n\n[[File:Newt Leta and Tina escaping Matagots.gif|250px|thumb|left|Newt with Leta and Tina escaping from the Matagots]]\nLater, Newt and Tina introduced themselves to [[Melusine]], the Ministry of Magic employee, as Theseus and Leta. Newt then revealed that his engagement was false and an error on the [[Spellbound (magazine)|magazine]].  He then tried to profess how he feels to Tina but stuttered as he tried to describe the fire in her eyes. Tina realised what he was trying to say about her eyes and expressed that she really loved that description of her eyes. When they went to the [[French Ministry of Magic Records Room|Records Room]] to find the [[Lestrange family]] box, they were covered by Leta searching for the box too. They found out that the box was taken to the [[Lestrange Mausoleum]], but Melusine knew Newt and Tina had lied about their identity and sent the [[Matagot]]s, creatures responsible for defending the French ministry, after them and Leta. Newt told them that if they did not fight the Matagots they wouldn't hurt them, but Leta had already attempted to [[Stunning Spell|stun]] one, which caused it to multiply. When a hoard of angry Matagots began to chase them, Newt sent Leta and Tina into the suitcase and with the help of the Zouwu, that he had saved earlier he fled to the [[Cimeti\u00e8re du P\u00e8re-Lachaise|Pere Lachaise Cemetery]].\n\n[[File:COG HQ still Yusuf Tina Leta Newt.jpg|250px|thumb|Newt with Yusuf, Leta and Tina in the Lestrange Mausoleum]]\nWhen Tina and Leta came out and Newt packed Zouwu inside the suitcase, they all head to the Lestrange tomb and Leta found the Lestrange box which was taken, but they were not alone. They crossed paths with Jacob, Yusuf, Credence and [[Nagini]]. Leta stopped Yusuf, her half-brother, from killing Credence, who thought he was her other half-brother, [[Corvus Lestrange (disambiguation)|Corvus Lestrange]]. Showing a box with her family tree she finally confessed to accidentally causing the death of Corvus, proving he and Credence were not the same person and that she had no idea who Credence actually was. Newt told her that it was not her fault that Corvus died, to which she responded that he had \"never met a monster [he] couldn't love\".\n\n====Grindelwald's Paris rally====\n[[File:Newt in the mausoleum.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Newt fighting against Grindelwald]]\nWhen the door to next chamber opened, Newt and others joined Grindelwald's [[Gellert Grindelwald's Paris rally|rally]]. He figured out that the departure of Queenie and moving the box were a bait to drag them to the mausoleum. During dark wizard's speech, a Niffler escaped from magizoologist suitcase. When the Aurors under Theseus' leadership infiltrated the rally and a [[Red-haired young witch|witch]] was [[Killing Curse|killed]] by [[Cassius Bell|one of the them]], a very angry Grindelwald knelt to her dead body, not knowing that Newt's Niffler lurked near him. Grindelwald sent his followers away to spread the word and he began the fight, [[Protego Diabolica|creating a circle of black flame]] to divide followers from enemies. Newt and [[Nagini]] unsuccessfully tried to pull Credence away from flames, same as Jacob want to do with Queenie, which was also at the rally. When they crossed unharmed and disapparated, Grindelwald then commanded his flames to kill Newt and Theseus, asking Newt did he think that Dumbledore will mourn after him, who both only managed to hold them back with the [[Shield Charm]]. Leta in response attacked Grindelwald and blasted his [[Gellert Grindelwald's skull-hookah|skull-hookah]] into pieces, sacrificing herself in an effort to give Newt, Theseus and the others time to get away. Before being killed by the dark wizard's flames she said to Newt and Theseus that she loved one of them, leaving Scamander brothers devastated. Newt seized Theseus and apparated with him outside the mausoleum, same as Tina did with Jacob and Yusuf with Nagini.\n\n[[File:Finite.gif|250px|thumb|Newt and Theseus both using the General Counter-Spell to extinguish Grindelwald's fire.]] Furious Grindelwald unleashed the fire in order to kill them and destroy the whole city before Disapparating. Fortunately, [[Nicolas Flamel]] had arrived at the cemetery. He instructed Newt, Theseus, Tina and Yusuf to form a ring around the cemetery, planting their wands in the ground and using the[[General Counter-Spell| general counter-spell]]. The effect was the creation of a counter-spell so great that it forced the fire back into the mausoleum where it ended its effects. After hugging a tearful Theseus and saying that he had chosen his side, Newt found his Niffler with stolen [[Gellert Grindelwald's pendant|pendant]] protecting Grindelwald from Dumbledore's direct interference and realised that his teacher made a [[Blood Pact]] with the dark wizard.\n\n[[File:Newt with Dumbledore at Hogwarts2.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Newt giving Dumbledore the pendant at Hogwarts]]\nDespite managing to reconcile with Tina, Newt was powerless to stop Grindelwald from delivering a rousing speech, sharing a vision, threatening Paris with cursed fire and collecting Queenie, Credence and his followers to strike against [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] (thus ridding himself of Albus Dumbledore) and the whole Wizarding and Muggle Worlds. During the battle that took place between Newt and Grindelwald, Scamander tragically lost his beloved Leta Lestrange, which finally compelled him to openly join the fight against the most dangerous dark wizard of his age.\n\nAfter the events in the mausoleum, Newt, along with the group from Paris, picked up Travers and Spielman and travelled to Hogwarts to meet with Dumbledore at [[Hogwarts Castle|Hogwarts]]. Newt delivered him the pendant, so Dumbledore could destroy it, henceforth allowing himself to finally participate in the war and defeat Grindelwald.<ref name=\"COGS\">{{COG|S}}</ref>\n\n====After Paris====\nA few years later, sometime in the [[1930s]], [[Albus Dumbledore]] enlisted Newt to start a [[Newton Scamander's army|army]], with intrepid [[wizardkind]] to fight against [[Gellert Grindelwald]] and his [[Alliance]].<ref name=\"SOD\">{{SOD}}</ref>\n\n===Later life {{C|1945\u20132017}}===\n{{Quote|Regarded as the world authority on magical creatures, Newt Scamander is the author of ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'', which has been an approved textbook at Hogwarts since its publication in 1927 and can be found in most wizarding households.|Scamander's Chocolate Frog Card|Pottermore}}\n[[File:Newton Scamander-1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Newt in his later years]]\nScamander married [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]], and together they had at least one child<ref name=\"child\" /> who produced at least one grandson named [[Rolf Scamander|Rolf]].<ref name=\"JK web chat\" />\n\nIn [[1947]], Scamander was responsible for the inception of the [[Werewolf Register]], and, in [[1965]], created the [[Ban on Experimental Breeding]], which he considered his proudest moment.

He played an active part in defeating Grindelwald over the next two decades. Newt was prevented from sharing any information between then and now, but the declassified documents were now beginning to be released, and he would be free to talk about them when they were.\n\nHowever, Newt added he would in fact become involved in the hunt for Grindelwald later, and that he played an actual part in that hunt over the next two decades.<ref name=\"FB2017\" />\n\n==Physical description==\nNewton Scamander was a tall wizard (6'1\"), with brown hair and hazel eyes.<ref name=\"ID Card\"/> At age 29, even though he gave off the appearance of a slight, awkward man, he was actually rather muscular.<ref name=\"Flaa\">Flaa, Kjersti (2016-11-14).

He also owned a Hufflepuff scarf that he occasionally wore.\n\nDuring his travels in Paris, in 1927, he was shown with a grey woollen coat, and his usually unkempt looks became scruffier and more haggard, as his international travel ban and the attempts of the [[Minister for Magic]] to recruit him against [[Credence Barebone]] and [[Gellert Grindelwald]] were weighing on him heavily.\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|There are no strange creatures, only blinkered people.|Newt Scamander|Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald}}\nNewton Scamander was a dedicated individual who tirelessly researched new information for his book ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'',<ref name=\"FB\" /> even when he was supposedly retired.<ref name=\"FW\" /> Considered an authority in the field of Magizoology, his works were respected throughout the wizarding community.<ref name=\"FB\" /> Newton was described as eccentric and felt more comfortable around creatures than he did around humans.<ref>[http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-characters/2368718_eddie-redmayne-newt-scamander 'Fantastic Beasts' Character Descriptions Revealed]</ref> Eye contact and being close to another person usually made him very uncomfortable.

He preferred the company of his magical beasts, whom he expressed terror at the thought of them coming to harm. Unlike his confident older brother who was respected by his superiors, those in the Ministry (except for his brother and Leta Lestrange) didn't hold him in that high a regard. Newt was also uncomfortable with affection between himself and another human, struggling to come up with an explanation for Tina about his \"engagement\" to Leta, and disliking being hugged by his older brother. Newt himself admitted that he showed poor judgement in his youth; he was also outspoken in his opinion of Aurors, despite Tina Goldstein herself being an Auror. Another example is when he brought his Thunderbird to the United States to set him free, let alone an entire suitcase full of magical creatures, given MACUSA's curse-to-kill policy at the time on such creatures.<ref name=\"FB2017\" />\n\nThat said, beneath his awkwardness and social problems, Newt, in true Hufflepuff fashion, was a man of great principles and deep compassion, never discriminating against people based on their heritage or beliefs, not once abandoning his moral code for self-serving purposes, and being courteous with non-magical individuals, showing none of the typical prejudice towards Muggles that were common amongst most wizardkind, along with being willing to forgive those who have initially offended or wronged him in the past and able to sympathise with and comfort others who have suffered a great tragedy as well as selflessly overcome his misgivings when it came to the people he loved. As [[Albus Dumbledore]] himself noted, Newt was actually acutely aware of the price of his actions, yet his morality meant he would always strive to do the right thing, without any regard for safety, personal gain or even his own well being, having no desire to seek power or fame at all, traits which earned him Dumbledore's respect and admiration. Dumbledore respected and admired Newt enough to speak out fervently against his expulsion from Hogwarts.<ref name=\":0\">{{COG}}</ref>\n\nThis was shown when Newt developed a strong and consistent friendship with the No-Maj Jacob Kowalski, whom he admitted to really like and to really appreciate for his qualities and his helpfulness during their adventures, and to whom he even went out of his way to anonymously give [[Occamy egg]]s so that Jacob could open his own bakery. Despite being bitter towards Theseus and Leta's engagement, Newt still loved them, and remained friendly and cordial towards them, tolerating their attempts to show him affection to an extent and even accepting to be the best man at the wedding, along with going as far as to defend Leta when she showed her self-hatred for her part in [[Corvus Lestrange (V)|Corvus V's]] death, when she lamented that Newt \"had never met a monster he couldn't love\" and repair his relationship with Theseus after Leta's death by embracing him despite being uncomfortable with doing so in the past. He also stated that he would be willing to let Tina go if she no longer had feelings for him and was outraged with Queenie for enchanting Jacob so he would consent to marriage, not hesitating to lift the spell so his friend could decide for himself, showing his astute moral code and selflessness held firm even when it came to his closest companions.\n\nNewt's morality also meant that he utterly disapproved ideas of morbidity, cruelty, and fanatical self-purpose, as displayed by how despite not supporting the world's act against Grindelwald and his troubled past, he still utterly refused to even consider joining Grindelwald's fanatics, being disgusted at the mere idea and holding their fanatical belief of mass-slaughters as being tolerable for the Greater Good as being reprehensive. He was never swayed by Grindelwald on either of their encounters, even in the face of the undeniably far more powerful dark wizard, and strove valiantly to thwart and defeat him at all costs, eventually joining the war against him after the death of Leta as he simply could not remain on the side lines after seeing the full extent of Grindelwald's supremacy plans. He also found the idea of using an [[Obscurus]] that killed a child for personal gain as utterly disgusting and spoke reasonably with Credence Barebone despite him being in a volatile and dangerous Obscurus form and refused to hunt him down even when offered the restoration of his right to internationally travel, being supportive of Tina's approach to redeem and rescue him first when he finally involved himself into the hunt for Credence.\n\nBeneath Newt's meek and awkward attitude, however, he could also display anger and coldness when the situation called for it, though he would express it in a way that was quite calm yet serious, maintaining his composure while letting his actions speak more, in a way that was eerily similar to his mentor Dumbledore's own fury. This was displayed when Newt was disgusted enough by Grindelwald (disguised as Graves) pointing out that Newt had the potential to serve his revolution that he completely forsaken the amiability he had been keeping to give him a cold glare as he angrily declared he would never be one of Grindelwald's fanatics, the rage being enough to even impress Grindelwald somewhat. Later on, Newt would abruptly leave his meeting with the international committee when he learned they would send Grimmson after Credence if he refused and later on coldly confront his brother over the idea of sending such a vicious man. The two times he displayed outrage towards Queenie was also enough to intimidate her, despite her experience with people being frustrated with her, making her quickly apologise when he called her out for reading his mind for his past with Leta and later on displaying enough anger upon learning that she had brought Jacob against his will and forced him to marry her that she decided to back down rather than challenging him.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Magic]]al mastery''': Newt, despite his awkward behaviour and initial lack of recognition, proved himself to be an exceptionally skilled and powerful wizard, worthy of being deemed the favourite student of Albus Dumbledore, with a considerable amount of magical knowledge and variety of proficient skills that afforded him a highly versatile skillset and allowed him to handle numerous dangerous situations effectively. In addition to being a famous [[Magizoologist]] who was capable of facing and handling some of the most dangerous beasts in the world and contributed deeply to the advancement of the magical field, Newt's magical abilities were secretly acknowledged by the [[Ministry of Magic]] and deemed surpassing enough that they repeatedly offered to make him an Auror out of a true belief that he would make an exceptional one, and even his war hero [[Theseus Scamander|brother]] and the international wizarding committee that included even the abrasive [[Torquil Travers]] along with [[Rudolph Spielman]] and [[Arnold Guzman]] deemed him as being magically competent and strong enough to function as an efficient one, despite Newt's personality and repeated refusal, the committee going as far as to use his international travel rights as leverage to try to convince him to participate in the [[Global wizarding war]] and help hunt down [[Gellert Grindelwald]], even being the first candidate to the mission of hunting down the extremely powerful [[Credence Barebone]], and as an active participant, was able to offer remarkable contributions to the end of the [[global wizarding war]], including even surviving at least two encounters with [[Gellert Grindelwald]], once managing to hold him at bay just enough for Credence to save him and also being the only reason why he was captured when he was fighting an entire squad of aurors and easily winning in said encounter and later aiding his brother, future wife, and Leta in holding up against the Dark Wizard, at which point he also effectively aided Theseus, Tina, Yusuf and Nicolas Flamel in saving Paris.\n*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': From a young age, Newt was already quite interested in [[Magizoology]] and highly talented, known for having excelled in his studies on the field as a Hogwarts student and acquired extensive knowledge of magical creatures which secured him a position in the Ministry of Magic's [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]] before being transferred to the [[Beast Division]] merely two years after being inside the [[Office for House-Elf Relocation]] and advancing at a meteoric rate, quickly achieving a series of prestigious promotions and becoming so well-regarded as to be tasked to write the first edition of the {{FB}} by [[Augustus Worme]]. His travels around the world allowed him to expand his knowledge and skill to phenomenal levels as he acquired complete understanding of many magical creatures through the world, earning a famous reputation for being one of the greatest [[Magizoologist]]s in the world as he contributed so much to the advancement of Magizoology that he was awarded an Order of Merlin Second Class and honoured with a Chocolate Frog Card named after him, his book displaying thorough knowledge of many of the beasts and creatures in the wizarding world, both dangerous and non-dangerous. Newt's exceeding talents in Magizoology and knowledge gave him a natural way to handle animals in a manner most wizards do not, having an innate ability to communicate and bond with beasts of all shapes, such as [[Thunderbird]]s and [[Bowtruckle]]s \u2014 treating the latter much like a parent would a child. This was also displayed by how he was the only one capable of reasoning with the [[Ukrainian Ironbelly]] out of all the squad members sent to recruit the dragons. Newt's skill in Magizoology was such that he was even capable of using such beasts for numerous purposes and could fully control even dangerous beasts, such as using the [[Swooping Evil]] to aid him in combat by either pinning enemies or catching them off-guard, a [[Zouwu]] to easily dispatch the Matagots of the French Ministry of Magic and teleport to the [[Lestrange Mausoleum]] in an instant in time to intercept Credence, and even using his Niffler to steal from Gellert Grindelwald the blood pact vial of him and Dumbledore. His knowledge was also noteworthy and could effortlessly and swiftly come up with methods to restrain or tame such dangerous beasts on his own, as shown with his ability to readily retrieve the creatures who escaped from his case, his taming of the highly dangerous Zouwu by using a toy, his quick solving of Yusuf Kama's problems with a water dragon parasite, and his instant recognition of the Matagots and knowledge of how to deal with them.\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Newt was shown to be very accomplished in charm-work. Highly adept in the use of simple and moderate charms, he repeatedly successfully performed the [[Summoning Charm]] at rather complicated and difficult situations, able to summon an egg from across a room with a man still holding onto it, simultaneously pull his Niffler and the jewellery he was stealing to him, effortlessly summon in an instant Jacob's jacket from the upper levels of his house while Newt himself was far below on his secret dungeon of creatures, instantly summon his Niffler from his suitcase and easily cast it while also riding on the Zouwu to summon his suitcase.  He also easily [[Mending Charm|repaired]] the entire upper half of [[Jacob Kowalski]]'s apartment in mere seconds. Newt used the [[Wand-Lighting Charm]] to illuminate Yusuf's infected eye to clearly see the water parasite inside it. Newt's mastery of the [[Shield Charm]] was incredible, able to instantly manifest powerful magical shields with ease and was powerful enough to even counter spells cast by Gellert Grindelwald himself, as shown by how he fended off Grindelwald's fierce lightning attacks and even later on his [[Protego Diabolica|dark blue fire]] both by himself and alongside Theseus, and his proficiency with the [[General Counter-Spell]] also allowed him to aid Nicolas Flamel, Tina Goldstein, Yusuf Kama and Theseus in containing said blue fire. He easily cast such a powerful [[Windy Spell]] on [[Stebbins (Auror)|Stebbins]] that it not only stopped him in his tracks but also blew him backwards in the opposite direction, and later cast a charm that released a stream of wind to dry Jacob's clothes. Newt's skill with charms was displayed fully by how he thoroughly enchanted his suitcase, performing the [[Extension Charm|Undetectable Extension Charm]] on the interior of his suitcase to expansive levels, creating enough space to hold many magical creatures in replicas of their native habitats, and displaying sufficient command of [[Atmospheric Charm]]s to create weather conditions such as hot desserts and frozen snowcaps for certain creatures, leaving the likes of Tina and Queenie quite impressed with the magic of his suitcase. His abilities even made him capable of creating a magical bubble to contain and sustain an [[Obscurus]], even after the death of its host.<ref name=\"FB47\">{{FB|S|47}}</ref> Newt was capable of performing the advanced [[Memory Charm]] to alter the memories of Muggles who witnessed magic, which he used to erase the [[memory]] of an [[unidentified hobo]] in 1926. He even used the advanced [[Confundus Charm]] effortlessly on a muggle guard strong enough to affect his behaviour and last for minutes. He also effortlessly and swiftly [[Surgito|removed]] a powerful [[Entrancing Enchantments|love enchantment]] that Queenie placed on Jacob with a simple wave of his wand. Newt also displayed excellent skill in the usage of revealing and tracking charms, making use of the [[Revelio Charm]] to bypass Grindelwald's [[Human Transfiguration]] and later flawlessly making use of several spells in his efforts to find clues on Tina, successfully using a [[Tracking spell]] to display magical traces of activities related to his future wife, performing ''Revelio'' to reveal the footsteps of a Zouwu, and then performing ''[[Avenseguim]]'' to track the origins of the feather possessed by Yusuf Kama back at him.\n*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': As one would expect for being a favourite student of Albus Dumbledore back when he held the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts, Newt was outstandingly skilful and knowledgeable at defending himself against the [[Dark Arts|Dark Forces]]. Acknowledged by both his war hero and Head Auror brother Theseus and even the abrasive Travers, Spielman, and Guzman, Newt was often sought and offered the position of an Auror, despite his repeated refusals, believing he would have been an excellent Auror. It should be noted that Newt had not even graduated, which could be a further testament to his mastery. His mastery of such practices were put to good use during his participation in the global wizarding war, having survived many years involved in the hunt for Gellert Grindelwald, presumably having fought and defeated many of Grindelwald's followers, and he was even capable of surviving at least two subsequent duels with the arguably greatest dark wizard of all time himself. In the first duel, he was able to, even if barely, successfully repel Grindelwald's lightning curses long enough for Credence to transform. During his second altercation with the fearsome Dark Wizard, Newt alone protected himself Grindelwald's tremendously powerful [[Protego Diabolica|black fire]] while many Aurors proved to be easily killed by it, although he was not able to bypass it and prevent Credence from joining Grindelwald, and later alongside Theseus fought the Dark Wizard's devastating spell off long enough to be saved by Leta as well as successfully forcing off wild outbursts of it on his own when Grindelwald was not focusing the flames on him. He also was easily able to swiftly follow Nicolas Flamel's instructions on how to overcome said dark magic fire, by collectively casting the [[General Counter-Spell|General Counter Spell]] with his brother, Yusuf, his future wife and also Nicolas, allowing them to contain and extinguish the fire and therefore prevented it from the destroying the whole city of Paris. Newt's competence in this field was even enough to handle the extremely powerful dark force of [[Obscurus]]es, as he had the ability to extract an Obscurus from its [[Obscurial]] and keep it from causing any harm by isolating it inside a bubble, a feat that even Grindelwald himself found to be impressive. Newt was also confident in his ability to handle even Credence Barebone's Obscurial abilities, and Dumbledore himself believed Newt would be capable of saving Credence from his Obscurus, while Theseus and the international committee believed he would have the ability to overcome Credence.\n*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': Newt was shown to be fully capable of using magic non-verbally, a testament to his actually considerable magical skills. He was able to summon an Occamy egg held in Jacob Kowalski's hand without saying the incantation, ending up sending Jacob flying towards him at great speed, turn a window opening into a jelly-like substance to trap his [[Niffler]], use a mind-altering spell on muggles that saw his creatures break out of Jacob Kowalski's apartment, and also aid Yusuf, Nicolas, Theseus and Tina in containing the blue fire left by Grindelwald without speaking a word. He also proved quite capable of wordlessly using offensive and defensive magic spells, such as when he deflected Grindelwald's attacks and countered with his own as well as conjured a lasso of a gelatinous substance to restrain Grindelwald after distracting him with his [[Swooping Evil]] and later held off Grindelwald's blue fire alongside Theseus without speaking a word.\n*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Newt appeared to be fairly competent with transfiguration, given how he was able to swiftly [[Glass to jelly spell|transform glass into a sticky jelly-like substance]] to trap one of his Nifflers.<ref name=\"FB50\">{{FB|S|50}}</ref>\n*'''[[Apparition]]''': Newt proved to be quite skilled in Apparition, as he was able to successfully Apparate in many different situations, including on the air, and even made use of it to avoid the violent attacks from an [[Obscurus]] as well as [[Gellert Grindelwald]].\n*'''[[Herbology]]''': Newt was also proficient in looking after magical flora and was familiar with their properties, keeping several potted plants on a shelf in his shed in the magically expanded [[Newton Scamander's suitcase|suitcase]]. After [[Jacob Kowalski]] suffered a \"slightly more severe reaction\" than Newt had known anyone else to have after he was was bitten by a [[Murtlap]] that escaped Newt's case, Newt used plants and the contents of various bottles to create a poultice, and successfully stopped the [[Non-magic people|No-Maj]]'s fever-like sweating.\n*'''[[Healing magic]]''': Newt was quite adept and knowledgeable in Healing Magic, as he could easily recognise and identify the nature of and prepare medicinal remedies to cure the symptoms of creature-induced injuries, such as he did when he treated [[Jacob Kowalski]]'s bite from a [[Murtlap]] and the subsequent symptoms. He also had various pills for the same purpose available and knew which ones had what effects upon consumption.\n*'''[[Potion]]s''': Newt was quite knowledgeable and accomplished in potions, particularly those that used parts of magical creatures as ingredients, writing down notes about it in his books and also successfully experimenting with novel potions such as uses for [[Swooping Evil venom]], diluting its poisonous properties to create a brew that could erase memories. He was also capable of successfully brewing the complex [[Polyjuice Potion]] in order to disguise himself as his brother, a particularly complex and advanced brew, showing his impressive abilities in this field.\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': Beguiling his peaceful disposition, Newt was an exceptional duellist, being considerably proficient with both offensive and defensive spells. His skills in duelling were acknowledged by even duellists on the level of his war hero brother Theseus and the abrasive members of the international committee, including the likes of Torquil Travers, being regularly offered the chance to become an Auror, going as far as to resort to holding his right to international travel as leverage in order to recruit him as an active participant of the global wizarding war, even being tasked to slay the extremely powerful Credence, and surviving in such a conflict for years hunting down Grindelwald and the [[Alliance]]. He seamlessly used the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] on No-Maj [[Gilbert Bingley]] upon nearly being arrested and easily overpowered a Ministry agent watching him. Newt was also confident that he would be fully capable of handling [[Queenie Goldstein]] if it came to it when they were arguing over the enchantment she placed on Jacob, and Queenie, indeed having seen Newt's memories and his duelling feats, was intimidated enough to back down rather than duel Newt. Newt was even skilled enough in magical combat to be capable of temporarily holding his ground against the extraordinarily powerful [[Gellert Grindelwald]] himself and surviving encounters with him, putting up a better fight than Tina did when he was disguised as [[Percival Graves]], avoiding an oncoming spell after being knocked down and firing a white offensive spell at him in return, although it was easily deflected, for a time repelling Grindelwald's attacks, before being swiftly knocked down by a particularly powerful shock wave of electricity but still able to hold off Grindelwald's attempts to torture him by blue lightning bolts, lasting long enough for Credence to distract Grindelwald and having not suffered any noteworthy injury, Newt managed to blind-side and subdue the aforementioned Dark Wizard from behind when he was preoccupied fighting against a small army of MACUSA Aurors, and later duelling Grindelwald once again in Paris alongside Theseus, Leta, and Tina and fending him off enough to escape without any injuries. Newt also displayed some noteworthy skill in [[Muggle duelling|physical combat]], as deprived of his wand, Newt was able to overpower the guards who were about to execute him and Tina, easily punching down a male guard and turning a female executioner's wand against another one.\n*'''[[History of Magic]]''': Newt also had knowledge of magical history, especially of Magizoology. A whole chapter of {{FB}} was devoted to the definitions of [[beast]]s, [[being]]s, and [[spirit]]s and how the definitions have evolved in past centuries.\n*'''Knowledge of the [[Non-magic world|Muggle world]]''': Newt displayed a considerable amount of knowledge on [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] that allowed him to effectively and flawlessly interact with Muggles of many countries while on his adventures and keep his magical abilities a secret, able to conduct his usually dangerous activities without earning the suspicion or attention of Muggles most of the time. He had particular expertise on Muggle topics related to Beasts, displaying complete knowledge on history of Muggles related to Beasts as well as how Muggles reacted to magical creatures and how beasts included in muggle fairy tales, like fairies, differed from real ones, knowing about Muggles' awareness of Diricawl and that they believed that they hunted it to extinction, writing a whole chapter in his book about Muggle awareness of beasts, and even displayed knowledge on the physiology of Muggles when faced with magic, stating how differently the bodies of Muggles react to magic and giving Jacob some armour when dealing with a [[Erumpent]] for protection.\n*'''[[Wandlore]]''': Newt had some knowledge of the properties of [[wand core]]s, including [[Thunderbird tail feather]]s.\n*'''[[Love]]''': Despite all of Newt's complicated past and his preference of the company of magical creatures more than fellow human beings, he proved to be capable of remarkably strong love. Newt's love for his magical creatures lead to him occasionally tending to and keeping them as good pets rather than dangerous and he refused to put them down even when faced with the possibility of MACUSA's retaliation. Newt was also fully capable of feeling genuine love and attachment to others: He  clearly cared deeply for his friends, family, and the whole wizarding world. It was his ability to love that gave him the willingness to take the blame for Leta's actions despite the fact that he would be expelled for it and even with their complicated past and his bitterness towards her and Theseus's relationship, Newt still loved them and was willing to accept their marriage and even be their best man to support their happiness, comfort Leta over her self-loathing and guilt of accidentally killing her brother, fight alongside Theseus and Leta against Grindelwald, and repair his relationship with Theseus after Leta's sacrifice, ultimately leading to him siding against Grindelwald despite his previous refusal. Newt's love for Tina also allowed him to muster the determination to break the rules and travel to Paris despite the international travel ban placed on him and the strength of his feelings for her allowed him to put up with her bitterness and ultimately confess to her, eventually leading to their marriage. Newt was even successful in sympathising with and comforting Credence Barebone out of his Obscurus form, though tragically ended up failing due to Grindelwald's intervention and MACUSA's subsequent attack on him, and Dumbledore specifically sent Newt after Credence believing he would be capable of giving Credence the love needed to cure him of the [[Obscurus]] inside him.\n*'''Indomitable willpower''': Newt, despite his awkwardness, wielded immense willpower and bravery. He proved himself to be fully capable of standing up to others when needed, even if they were of high authority, and firmly maintaining his morality, as shown by how he adamantly refused to hunt down [[Credence Barebone]] when asked to by [[Torquil Travers]], [[Arnold Guzman]], and [[Rudolph Spielman]] despite their offer to restore his right to travel, and despite being bound, was quick to stand up to [[Gellert Grindelwald]] in his [[Percival Graves]] disguise when he insinuated that Newt was working [[For the Greater Good]], something that actually impressed the [[Dark wizard]]. Indeed, he was admired by [[Albus Dumbledore]] himself for his uncanny willingness to do what is right no matter the cost, as displayed by his willingness to accept Dumbledore's safe-house address and then go on to ultimately travel to Paris illegally to not only seek Tina out but also save Credence, and despite seeing horrific visions of a future [[Second World War]], Newt demonstrated his incorruptible spirit and morals by resisting Grindelwald's persuasive speech, maintaining a brave face whereas all other participants of the rally and even Jacob, a veteran of the World War I, were all genuinely terrified, instead valiantly fighting against the Dark wizard's [[Protego Diabolica|black fire]], and, inspired by [[Leta Lestrange|Leta]]'s sacrifice, officially joining the [[global wizarding war]] efforts against him.\n*'''Physical aptitude''': Newt was in excellent physical condition, supporting a surprisingly muscular built despite his awkward appearances. He was physically strong and fast enough to be able to overtake several executioners of MACUSA without a wand, knocking one out with a single punch and moving faster than a female executioner can point her wand at him to turn the spell against another executioner. Newt also had astonishing levels of physical resilience and durability, having survived tangling with some of the most dangerous creatures in the wizarding world with only a few scars and he even quickly rebounded from being a hit by a spell from Gellert Grindelwald with no injuries and then withstood some lightning curses from Grindelwald and being knocked to the ground by Credence's attacks with only minor pain and no lasting harm and injury.\n*'''Detective skills''': Despite his socially awkward personality, from his experiences with many of the most dangerous and obscure beasts, having successfully discovered and solved their problems, Newt had shown himself to possess formidably sharp and intuitive deduction skills. He was able to quickly make an accurate deduction of where his creatures would go after they escaped his case and see through their attempts to hide themselves with ease. From his interactions with Grindelwald while he was disguised as Percival Graves, Newt was able to correctly deduce the true identity of the man as being the greatest Dark Wizard himself in disguise. With just a few clues provided by Graves and seeing Credence's power, despite never interacting with Credence before, he was able to figure out right away that Credence was the Obscurial, along with also coming up with the correct calculation that Credence was able to survive far longer than normal because he possessed immense amounts of magical raw power. Newt even figured out Dumbledore's subtle manipulations that sent him to New York and was perceptive enough to even pick up on Dumbledore's reasons of not fighting Grindelwald from how he spoke of it, deducing that something was preventing Dumbledore, and instantly figured out that it was because of the Blood Pact between them the moment he lay his eyes on the vial Grindelwald had. Newt was also able to swiftly deduce from Jacob's abnormal behaviour and Queenie's frustration with the illegality of her relationship with Jacob that she had enchanted her boyfriend so he would accept to be married.\n*'''Resourcefulness and strategical aptitude''': Despite his principals of not worrying or planning too much, when pushed, Newt proved to be a considerably talented and resourceful strategist. With only a minimum amount of resources at hand, he has proven able to repeatedly come up with numerous plans on the fly quite quickly that has successfully saved the day, making maximum use of anything he had in his disposal to great effect, and his calmness in the face of danger and tactical genius allows him to swiftly adapt or shift his plans to match situations where the condition has changed. While wandless, Newt swiftly managed to use his creatures to turn the tides against the executioners and save both himself and Tina, quickly breaking Tina out of the euphoria stupor she was induced to by breaking the illusion of her happy memory and then coming up with a plan accurately timed to rescue her from the [[Death potion]] using the Swooping Evil before using it to swiftly escape from MACUSA. During his hunt to recapture the creatures that escaped from his suitcase, Newt came up with numerous plans and adapted them to fit the situation when faced with unexpected setbacks, successfully retrieving them without causing major damage. Knowing he could not possibly defeat Grindelwald in a fair fight, Newt opted to wait until Grindelwald had started fighting the Aurors until he used his Swooping Evil to catch him off-guard and restrain him, becoming subsequently the first person to capture the infamous Dark Wizard. Newt also came up with a successful plan to leave Britain and go against his international ban by hiring an illegal Portkey provider, knowing it's the only way to leave without the Ministry's watchful eyes preventing him and upon arriving on his destination, quickly came up with a plan in order to find a clue to Credence's location and his identity and infiltrate the French Ministry of Magic by disguising himself as Theseus and avoiding attention from all but Theseus himself, only being caught by Leta and subsequently Mesuline in the end and swiftly coming up with a plan to escape by using the Zouwu he had acquired previously. Newt even swiftly came up with a plan to outsmart Grindelwald once more by taking the blood pact from him using his Niffler when Grindelwald was kneeling down and focused on martyring a girl, a success that would ultimately prove most crucial in the end of the global wizarding war.\n*'''Leadership skills''': As acknowledged by Dumbledore himself, Newt's desire to only do the right thing no matter what and lack of lust for power meant he was naturally suited to be a leader and had the potential to excel more than Dumbledore did, as while Dumbledore had sought power in his youth and only realised the mistakes of his approach to leadership after a great tragedy, subsequently avoiding anything too demanding, Newt always never sought power but would accept the burden of command and take responsibility for those who \"followed\" him no matter how uncomfortable he was in the prospect while subsequently proving effective. Indeed, while not often employing this trait due to working alone, he quickly displayed an innate talent for leadership and charisma when it came to himself, Tina, Jacob, and Queenie until her defection to Grindelwald's side, inspiring them to follow his instructions and showing decent skills as a leader during their hunt for the magical creatures that escaped from his suitcase and taking the lead between himself and Jacob or himself and Tina during their escapades in Paris, succeeding in both times. Newt was also trusted by Dumbledore to found [[Newton Scamander's army|an army of skilled wizards and witches]] and lead the group against Grindelwald's Alliance.\n*'''Author skills''': Newt was an exceptional author when it came to writing books related to magical creatures, with tireless passion, famous particularly for having been the one who wrote the top-quality creatures book of {{FB}}, which contained detailed information regarding many magical creatures in existence, and continuing to develop special editions that were greatly desired and used by thousands of wizards and witches. He also authorised [[A Children's Anthology of Monsters]] for readers of young age.\n\n==Possessions==\n[[File:Newt Scamander wand.png|125px|thumb|Newt's wand]]\n*'''[[Newton Scamander's wand|Wand]]''': Newt's [[wand]] was an of an unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]]. Newt wielded his wand throughout his life and career, and was able to perform very powerful [[magic]] indeed with it.\n[[File:Scamander's suitcase.png|125px|thumb|Newt's enchanted suitcase]]\n*'''[[Newton Scamander's suitcase|Suitcase]]''': A magical suitcase [[Charm|enchanted]] with an [[Extension Charm|Undetectable Extension Charm]] in which he held a number of beasts while he travelled. He could hide the contents from [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] by flipping a switch on the case. In [[1926]], whilst visiting the [[United States of America]], the beasts in Newt's suitcase escaped, whereupon he was accosted by [[Percival Graves]], a powerful [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]] [[Auror]] and right-hand man of the American [[Wizardkind|wizarding community]]'s leader, [[Seraphina Picquery]]. The suitcase contains its own world with many different habitats for each creature. It also contains a place for Newt himself. Tina takes the suitcase with Newt inside it to MACUSA headquarters where she tells them about the creatures that have escaped.\n*'''[[Newton Scamander's passport|Passport]]''': Newt possessed a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] passport during his worldwide travels, which he used to disguise himself as one to the Muggle authorities when passing international border controls.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Family===\n====Theseus Scamander====\n{{Quote|The time is coming when you're gonna have to pick a side.|Theseus to Newt in the British Ministry of Magic|Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay}}\n[[File:Theseus Scamander.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Theseus Scamander]], Newt's older brother]]\nNewt's confident, successful and worldly older brother was, in so many ways, the polar opposite to Newt himself. The relationship between the two of them as children is unknown, but the fact that they chose woefully different career paths is a hint that their differences went back as far as childhood. \n\nBy adulthood, Newt's relationship with Theseus seemed to be very complex: Theseus openly confided in Newt about the dangers of Grindelwald and Newt in return seemed to tolerate his brother enough to accept letters from him and also heed his advice, which helped in his dealings with Grindelwald disguised as Graves. Theseus earning the love of his life, Leta Lestrange, left Newt even more distant towards his brother. His attitude towards his brother seemed to be a mixture of annoyance and politeness, being not openly hostile towards him but at the same time making it bluntly clear he had no inclination to follow around him and Leta nor live up to Theseus's expectations, along with being quite uncomfortable with Theseus's shows of affection and frequent hugs. He also did not hesitate to use a polyjuice potion to take on Theseus's form despite the possible repercussions it would have on his brother and when Tina overpowered Theseus in Paris, Newt remarked that witnessing it might be the greatest moment of his life, showing there was a part of Newt that resented Theseus. Despite this, however, Newt proved capable of putting aside their differences when push came to shove and he had to work with his brother, fighting side-by-side very effectively in Paris when battling against Grindelwald. The relationship finally got mended after the battle, as Newt actually comforted Theseus after Leta's death (as Leta was someone they both cared immensely about) and revealed that he had finally chosen a side to fight on. Later, Theseus persuaded the other Aurors to allow Newt and Dumbledore to speak alone.\n\n====Porpentina Goldstein====\n{{Quote|What I'm trying to say is, I want you to be happy, but don't be happy that I'm happy, because I'm not... happy.|Newt to Tina in the Records Room in the French Ministry of Magic|Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay}}\n[[File:Porpentina Goldstein.png|200px|thumb|[[Porpentina Goldstein]], Newt's love interest and wife]]\n[[Porpentina Goldstein]] was arguably the [[love]] of Newt's life. The two got off to a bad start after she followed Newt around while he caused trouble in a bank, and she kept having to demand that he take action since he clearly didn't want to. Eventually, not knowing his suitcase had been accidentally swapped with Jacob's, she turned him in to MACUSA for the threat he was unintentionally posing to New York. When Percival Graves saw confectionery instead of magical beasts while checking the suitcase, they left the MACUSA building together to find New's suitcase. When they did it, Tina offered Newt accommodation in her and her sister's apartment, but it didn't improve their relationship much, especially since Goldstein did it only because of the sick Jacob Kowalski, who had been bitten by one of the beasts which escaped from the suitcase, and also to be able to keep an eye on Newt.\n\nHowever, after they were both arrested and Newt saved her life, their relationship began to improve, as Tina began to understand why a man could depend on magical beasts. With time, Newt became more and more conscious of Tina's virtues, seeing that she was a good-hearted person and that her previous desire to report his misdeeds to the superiors might have resulted from ignorance and willingness to prove that she could return to an Auror position. Quests to search for the lost magical beasts, as well as their joint efforts while trying to defeat the Obscurus and even the capture of Gellert Grindelwald (while disguised Percival Graves), brought the two closer together. After the capture of Grindelwald, Newt told Seraphina Picquery about Tina's actions, which resulted in her being restored as an Auror, for which Tina was extremely grateful to him. At the time of his departure, Newt said he was going to publish [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them|a book]] and Tina briefly asked him if [[Leta Lestrange]], the girl he once loved, liked to read. Newt only answered that he didn't really know what Leta liked these days, because people changed - and he had probably changed too. Tina promised to buy his book, and joyfully accepted when Newt asked if he could come back and give her a copy in person.\n\nDue to his subsequent travel ban, Newt couldn't return to visit Tina and give her the book, so he had corresponded with her by letter, but a series of missteps on Newt's part, namely his accidental denunciation of Aurors as \"career-driven hypocrites\", had soured the relationship. Their relationship got even colder when Tina read an article in [[Spellbound (disambiguation)|Spellbound]], which had reported on the launch party of {{FB}} and falsely stated that Newt was engaged to Leta Lestrange.''' '''The belief that Newt had rekindled his relationship with Leta was too much for Tina, and she broke off contact with Newt and started seeing a fellow Auror named Achilles Tolliver. When he learned that Credence had survived and Grindelwald escaped from MACUSA's prison in order to find him, Newt was ordered by Albus Dumbledore to go to Paris, where Credence was believed to be hiding. Newt refused, but when he learned from Queenie that Tina was also there to find Credence, he travelled to France without hesitation. Newt was determined to have Tina learn the truth, although she remained cold with him, insisting on calling him \"Mr Scamander\". Nevertheless, Newt eventually managed to subtly confess his feelings for her, awkwardly stating that she had \"eyes like a [[Fire Dwelling Salamander|salamander]]\". The two worked together once again when Grindelwald was summoning his followers.\n\nNewt and Tina got married at some point after the 1920s, and had at least one child, likely a son.<ref>Though it is possible that the Scamander name was passed down through a daughter, family names in both the United Kingdom and the United States are usually passed down through the male line.</ref> In the 1990s, Newt and Tina were living together in Dorset with their three pet [[Kneazle]]s, [[Hoppy]], [[Milly]] and [[Mauler]], and had at least one grandson, [[Rolf Scamander]].\n\nNewt and Tina became great-grandparents after Rolf's wife, [[Luna Lovegood]], gave birth to twin boys named [[Lorcan Scamander|Lorcan]] and [[Lysander Scamander|Lysander]]. In 2017, Newt was still living with Tina in Dorset at the age of 118.\n\n===Albus Dumbledore===\n{{Quote|I can't move against Grindelwald. It has to be you.|Albus to Newt during they meeting in London|Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay}}\n[[File:Albus newt.jpg|250px|thumb|Albus Dumbledore and Newt Scamander talking in London]]\nNewt's relationship with Albus Dumbledore was very close. During Newt's time at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], Dumbledore was his [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] Professor and among the very few who didn't look down on him, which started Newt's respect for the great professor. When one of [[Leta Lestrange]]'s experiments involving a magical beast went too far, endangering the life of another student. Newt did not want to see a friend thrown out of school, so he took the blame for Leta's actions, and was thus sentenced to be expelled from Hogwarts in her place. Newt developed unending trust and loyalty to Dumbledore after he argued strongly against his expulsion. It is unclear whether the expulsion was enforced or not, or if it was temporary or permanent. However, Newt was allowed to keep his wand.\n\nAfter school Newt probably was in a regular contact with his teacher. Newt respected his mentor enough to do tasks for him. Dumbledore told him where to find one ill-bred [[Thunderbird]] and later sent his former student to [[New York]] to release this beast, whose natural environment was [[Arizona]]. At this time Newt helped capture [[Gellert Grindelwald]], who was trying to convince [[Obscurial]] [[Credence Barebone]] to join his ranks. Newt was extremely loyal to Dumbledore, because when he appealed to his travel ban, he lied to the committee members that he had gone to the [[United States of America|United States]] on his orders. When Grindelwald managed to escape, Albus felt that he would not be able to fight the dark wizard, so he asked Scamander for help. Dumbledore admired him, because he didn't care about power or popularity, something that Newt did not understand as he was not aware of Dumbledore's past that made him realise his initial views was a foolish man's dream and that Dumbledore meant Newt could have become a leader even greater than himself. He sent Newt to [[Paris]] to rescue Credence, who survived battle in New York, but Newt was reluctant, nevertheless he was willing to accept the address of a [[Nicolas Flamel|safe-house]]. The rumours of Newton's potential travel to [[France]] reached the [[British Ministry of Magic]], and a delegation, including Newt's brother [[Theseus Scamander]], Leta Lestrange and [[Torquil Travers]], was sent to Hogwarts Castle to question Dumbledore. Albus only pretended that he did not know anything about it and said that Newt was not a great follower of orders. During the [[Gellert Grindelwald's Paris rally|Battle in Lestrange family Mausoleum]], vial of Dumbledore's and Grindelwald's [[blood pact]] was stolen from Grindelwald, however, without his knowledge by a [[Niffler]] belonging to Newt Scamander. Shortly thereafter Scamander brought it to Dumbledore at Hogwarts. Dumbledore expressed regret at Leta's death in mausoleum. Newt in turn did not ask Dumbledore why he would form a blood pact with Grindelwald but simply asked him to destroy it, showing respect for his privacy. Although it apparently took years, Dumbledore clearly managed to abolish the blood pact, allowing him to finally defeat Grindelwald in a legendary duel.\n\n===Jacob Kowalski===\n[[File:JacobKowalski.png|200px|thumb|[[Jacob Kowalski]], his good Muggle friend]]\n{{Quote|Hey! Mr English guy! I think your egg is hatching!|Jacob to Newt in the bank when Newt lost Occamy's eggshell|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}\nThe friendship between Newt and Jacob was the result of a pure luck encounter, as they both found themselves in the same bank, albeit for different reasons. Jacob was associated with Newt's quest for his lost creatures from the beginning, as he inadvertently took Newt's magical case full of creatures instead of his own, causing the escape of some magical beasts. Newt finally found Jacob, who had been bitten by a [[Murtlap]], and agreed to remain with the No-Maj until he was healed. Over the dinner they had with [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina]] and [[Queenie Goldstein]], Newt remarked how easy it was for Jacob to be appreciated by people, something Newt had trouble with since most people found him annoying. Newt and Jacob progressively bonded with each other, and once they successfully recaptured an [[Erumpent]], Newt was told by Jacob to call him by his first name instead of \"Mr Kowalski\". In the aftermath of the arrest of [[Gellert Grindelwald]] in New York, while Jacob was on the verge of being obliviated, he asked Newt why he had kept him around for so long, to which Newt simply replied that he liked Jacob and considered him a friend.\n\nNewt and Jacob reconnected months later, and Newt immediately sensed that something was wrong with Jacob, who was under the influence of a spell by Queenie. Newt demanded that Jacob was released from the spell in order to freely make his own choices. Newt and Jacob teamed up once again in the former's quest for [[Credence Barebone]], the two of them mentioning how difficult their relationships with the women they loved (Tina and Queenie) could be. Jacob also gave Newt advice on how he should compliment Tina once they would have found her.\n\n===Queenie Goldstein===\n[[File:Queenie and Jacob 2.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Queenie Goldstein]], a good friend]]\n{{Quote|People are easiest to read when they're hurting.|Queenie to Newt in Newt's suitcase.|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}\nQueenie met Newt when he, along with Jacob Kowalski, were brought to her apartment by her sister Tina. The man at first a bit reluctantly accepted Queenie's hospitality, but he did not refuse her and put up at their home. Their relationship quickly warmed and the woman joined in helping to catch the beasts that escaped from his suitcase. Queenie helped to transport Newt, Tina and Jacob from MACUSA, and she volunteered to stop the Obscurus threatening the city. When Queenie found out that he missed Leta Lestrange, she consoled him that she could only take, and he deserved someone better. Scamander couldn't fully open himself to Queenie, and the awareness of her magical reading skills in the mind drank him. Nevertheless, they had good relationships and could rely on each other.\n\nMonths later, Queenie with Jacob visited Newt in London. Newt was sad seeing that Tina didn't come with them and Queenie informed him that Tina was in Paris to look for Credence Barebone. She stated that her sister is heartbroken and showed him a copy of Spellbound magazine which ran a mistaken cover story on Newt's supposed engagement to Leta Lestrange. Queenie stated that she doesn't talk with her sister and tell magizoologist that she and Jacob were engaged and planned to be married. Newt was put off with Queenie's over-eagerness and Jacob's awkward demeanour, until he realised that Queenie had cast a powerful love charm on Jacob and was planning to illegally marry Jacob. This quickly made Newt furious with Queenie and seeing through her half-hearted efforts to defend herself, immediately prepared to cast the counter-spell on Jacob, refusing to let Jacob continue to be forced under Queenie's whims and also to prevent Queenie from punishment. Indicating that he would be willing to duel her if necessary, Queenie was intimidated enough to back down and Newt lifted the spell. Jacob refused to marry her, in fear of Queenie would be punished for marriage with him. As a result of this, Queenie felt betrayed by Newt and Jacob, though she may have also been afraid of Newt's clear anger when he realised Queenie really did go that far, so she left London and headed to Paris to find Tina, leaving two men in quest to find both sisters in France. During Grindelwald's rally in Lestrange family Mausoleum, Queenie joined the dark wizard's side, which saddened Newt.\n\n===Gellert Grindelwald===\n[[File:Gellert Grindelwald publicity still.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Gellert Grindelwald]], his mortal enemy]]\n{{Quote|What makes Albus Dumbledore so fond of you?|Grindelwald (as Percival Graves) to Newt during his interrogation|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}\nBeing the reigning Dark Wizard of Newt's time, Newt had heard a lot about Grindelwald and already strongly disapproved, of his views but he did not support the Ministry's act against him. Unbeknownst to him at first, he would meet Grindelwald while he was disguised as Percival Graves in New York. Grindelwald, not impressed by Newt's love for creatures or his magical skills, questioned him on why Dumbledore would be fond of him despite his unique traits, having known of Dumbledore's strong argument on Newt's expulsion, although Newt did not know why himself. Grindelwald seemed to have wanted to continue to talk about Dumbledore. Newt quickly began to dislike Grindelwald's reminder of his expulsion at Hogwarts and this increased even further when Grindelwald indicated Newt was working for the Greater Good, causing him to outrageously say that he wasn't one of Grindelwald's fanatics, which surprisingly not only didn't offend the Dark Wizard but even caused him to be amused, and when Grindelwald slipped up by saying the hostless Obscurus was useless, Newt expressed disgust at what Graves could possibly use it for. Ultimately, this interaction caused Newt to realise that Graves was Grindelwald and that he intended to use him and his friends (Tina, Jacob, and Queenie) as scapegoats for the Obscurus attacks, becoming determined to stop him before it got too far and subsequently engaging in a duel with Grindelwald upon intervening in Grindelwald's plan to acquire Credence Barebone. Newt did his best to hold off Grindelwald even as Grindelwald dropped all pretences and viciously attacked him with lightning spells in a fit of rage and eventually managed to capture Grindelwald by use of Swooping Evil and revealed his true identity to MACUSA. Before being carried off, Grindelwald turned to Newt, who glared defiantly back at him, and said mysteriously \"Will we die, just a little?\", possibly as a message for Dumbledore due to his knowing Newt's closeness to Dumbledore.\n\nNewt did not initially want to oppose Grindelwald, as he did not take sides. Grindelwald encountered Newt once more in Paris, during which Grindelwald's only exchange was asking Newt whether Dumbledore would mourn for him. Newt, however, did survive the battle but Grindelwald's murder of Leta left Newt with a strong hatred for him and he chose to side against him during the global wizarding war at last. His act of giving Dumbledore the blood pact would subsequently aid greatly in the defeat of Grindelwald.\n\nGrindelwald's hatred of Newt appeared to come, in part, from his jealousy of Dumbledore's care and admiration of the gifted young man. The Dark Wizard's mocking of Dumbledore's affection for him in the Lestrange Mausoleum is a hint at this, indicating the idea of Dumbledore having someone else other than Grindelwald to love infuriated him. Although the two former lovers now operated on two completely different ideologies, Grindelwald still felt that Dumbledore's attention should be on himself alone.\n\n===Leta Lestrange===\n[[File:Leta Profile.png|200px|thumb|[[Leta Lestrange]], Newt's childhood best friend]]\n{{Quote|Newt. You never met a monster you couldn't love.|Leta to Newt in Lestrange Family Mausoleum|Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay}}\nDue to both of them being outcasts and both of them loving magical creatures, Newt quickly befriended Leta and later fell in love with her, to the extent that he took the blame when Leta's experiments endangered a student and he was expelled. Although this left Newt bitter, he still loved Leta, keeping a picture of her in his suitcase, but was clearly resentful of how Leta never tried to contact him again, to the point of briefly lashing out at Queenie for reading his mind. This bitterness only increased when Leta and Theseus became engaged and he refused to interact with both of them at once. Newt himself found Leta's efforts to re-establish their close relationship as irritating and while he was not openly hostile, he would made it clear that he had no inclination to follow her firmly and almost coldly. However, it cannot be denied that Newt still loved her deep down despite his growing feelings for Tina, as he still agreed to be the best man at the wedding and defended her from her self-hatred when she revealed her part in Corvus's death, looking solemn when she stated that he had \"never met a monster he couldn't love\", referring to herself. Her sacrifice devastated Newt and he was inspired to join the global wizarding war in her honour.\n\n==Etymology==\n*''Newton'' is derived from the Old English place name meaning \"new town\" and was originally a surname. The most eminent historical figure with this surname is Sir Isaac Newton, who, while known largely for his contributions to the fields of mathematics and physics, also wrote many works on alchemy. Some of his writings suggest he was attempting to create a [[Philosopher's Stone]]<ref name=\"Isaac Newton\">\"[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/newton-dark-secrets.html Newton's Dark Secrets]\" documentary by PBS</ref>, inspired by the real [[Nicolas Flamel]].\n*''Artemis'' (\u1f0c\u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03c2) was a goddess in Greek mythology, the daughter of Zeus and Leto, and the twin sister of Apollo. She is the goddess of the moon, hunting, the wilderness, and the gift of taming wild animals. In myth, Artemis spends most of her time hunting, which she has in common with Newt, although he seeks wild animals for conservation rather than sport.\n*''Fido'' is of Latin origin, meaning \"I trust\" or \"faithful\". The name Fido is most commonly associated with being a common name for pet dogs in many countries.\n*''Scamander'' is very similar to the word salamander, which is a type of real-world amphibian. In the wizarding world, [[Fire Dwelling Salamander|salamanders]] are small lizards which feed on flames. Newts are also a type of salamander.\n*Scamander (\u03a3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2) is a river god in Greek mythology. The Scamander River (now known as the Karamenderes) flows over where the Trojan War was fought, according to Homer's Iliad.\n*Each of his four names are most likely referencing animals, due to his love for them.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:NewtWU.png|100px|thumb|Newt Scamander as he appears in {{WU}}]]\n[[File:Newt Scamander LEGO Dimensions E3 banner-PM.jpg|150px|thumb|Newt Scamander as he appears in {{LEGO|D}}]]\n[[File:NewtPOP.jpg|120px|thumb|Newt Scamander (carrying an [[Occamy egg]]shell) as a [[POP!

D\u00fcrer's dates do not match those of Scamander the slightest.

K. Rowling]] published a [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (companion book)|real]] version of {{FB}} for [[Comic Relief]], a UK based charity event. The book was written from an in-universe perspective, and Scamander was credited as the \"author\" of the book. The original book was updated in 2017 after the character appeared as the star character in the film [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|named directly after it]].\n*Newt was the first known Hufflepuff introduced in the series, although this information was not revealed until {{PM}} clarified his house.\n*When {{PS}} was originally translated into German, Newt's name was translated as \"Lurch\" Scamander. Lurch is a German word for amphibians, a family of animals the newt is also part of. When ''Fantastic Beasts'' was translated, his original first name was untranslated instead and Lurch was one of his middle names. This makes his full name in the German version \"Newton Artemis Fido Lurch Scamander\".\n**Similarly, in the French version of the Harry Potter books, he is named \"Norbert Dragonneau\" (Dragonneau meaning baby dragon), a possible foreshadowing to [[Norberta]]. In the translation of ''Fantastic Beasts'', however, it is said that this is actually a pen name, and the book uses his original name the rest of the time. Even though it's a pen name, the name \"Norbert Dragonneau\" is used in the French and French Canadian versions of the first film of {{FB}}.\n*While never specifically confirmed to play [[Quidditch]], when [[Mary Lou Barebone]] asks him if he is a \"[[seeker]] of truth,\" he replies \"I'm more of a [[chaser]], really.\"\n*While using the swooping evil to catch Grindelwald in the film version, the screenplay for the films states that he uses his wand.\n*Originally the visual artists crafted expansive environments for all the creatures in Newt's case; however, J.K. Rowling informed that he wasn't that great of a wizard and they scaled them down to be backdrops creating a sufficient semblance of the creatures' natural habitats.<ref name=\"WWMM2\">{{WWMM|2}}</ref>\n*Strangely, despite Newt being shown to be a loyal ally of Dumbledore as well as having played several key roles against Grindelwald, there is no mention of Newt having participated in either the First or Second Wizarding Wars against Lord Voldemort. He does not appear in the photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix and is not mentioned by Alastor Moody when showing the photograph to Harry. There is a chance however that he merely wasn't present for that particular photo and that he simply never encountered Harry.\n*It's possible that Newt attended Dumbledore's funeral in ''The Half Blood Prince'' and was unnamed, as it is stated that Harry did not recognise the majority of wizards who attended.\n*When asked by a fan about why Dumbledore would send Newt to take down Grindelwald when experienced aurors couldn't do it J.K. Rowling said that she could write an essay but that it would give away the whole plot of the Fantastic Beasts franchise.<ref name=\"essay\">[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1044585938590949376 Twitter]</ref>\n*When asked by the press if Newt will remain central to the franchise, David Heyman said yes, confirming that Newt was \"the key to all this\".<ref name=\"heyman\">[http://www.mugglenet.com/2018/08/crimes-of-grindelwald-set-visit-interview-david-heyman/ MuggleNet]</ref>\n**J.K.

This would explain how Newt knew what a \"bad reaction\" entailed, since no wizards before Newt dared to go near a Murtlap.\n*Eddie Redmayne has stated that he thinks that Newt is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism autistic].<ref name=\"autism\">[http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/fantastic-beasts/news/a870584/fantastic-beasts-newt-scamander-autism-eddie-redmayne-crimes-of-grindelwald/ Digital Spy]</ref> This would be consistent with Newt's disregard for many social norms, aversion to physical or eye contact, and firm sense of who he is, not to mention his own single-minded focus on his topics of perseverance and penchant for unorthodox solutions to daunting tasks.\n*Although having had been suggested in the novels that if a student is expelled from Hogwarts, their wand would be broken,<ref name=\"PS5\"/><ref name=\"OOTP2\">{{OOTP|B|2}}</ref> Newt owned and used a wand in his adult years.\n**Anyway, both Hagrid and Harry Potter, whose expulsion was reconsidered by the Ministry, were expelled after Newt. It might be possible that the Ministry introduced this particular law between 1914 circa (date of Newt's expulsion) and 1942/43, as Newt was allowed to keep his wand.<ref name=\"jkr-snitchseeker\" />\n*When [[J.
