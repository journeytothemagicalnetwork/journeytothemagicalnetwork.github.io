When she turned eleven she began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. During the [[1993\u20131994 school year|1993-1994 school year]], [[Harry Potter]] saw her roaming the [[Hogwarts Castle|castle]] alone rather often.\n\n==Etymology==\nHecate gets her name from ''Hecate,'' in Latin, or ''Hekate, in'' Greek. They both refer to the same goddess. In Greek mythology, she is an embodiment of the dark side of the moon and is the deity of magic. She is a foggy figure of unclear allegiances, sphere and parentage. She is chthonic and often is associated with sorcery, being the mother of angels and poisonous plants.\nThe Goddess ''Hecate'' in turn has verious etymology behind her name. Her name may originally come from the Greek word for will. Various Greeks have also translated her name to mean \"operates from afar\", \"she removes or drives off\", \"the far reaching one\" or \"the far-darter\". Another suggested root of the name is from the Egyptian goddess of childbirth, however, evidence for this is lacking.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{PS2 only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oakham, Hecate}}\n[[pl:Hecate Oakham]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Hufflepuffs]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
