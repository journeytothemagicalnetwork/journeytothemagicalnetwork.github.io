She married [[Ignatius Prewett]] and never had any children.\n\n==Biography==\nShe was born in 1925 as the eldest daughter of [[Arcturus Black III]] and [[Melania Macmillan]] and was the sister of [[Orion Black|Orion]]. She went to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1936]] or [[1937]], where she was sorted into [[Slytherin]] house.<ref name=\"house\"/>\n\nShe married [[Ignatius Prewett]]<ref name=\"BFT\"/>, making her the aunt of [[Gideon Prewett|Gideon]], [[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]], and [[Molly Weasley|Molly Prewett]] (later [[Weasley family|Weasley]])<ref>[[Sirius Black]] stated in Ch. 6 of {{OOTP}} that Molly Weasley was his \"cousin by marriage\". See this [[Talk:Ignatius Prewett|talk page]] for more information.</ref>. It is unknown if she was close to her relatives by marriage.\n\nShe was also [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] and [[Regulus Black]]'s biological aunt and a second cousin of [[Arthur Weasley]], Molly's husband.\n\nShe died in [[1992]] and is depicted on the [[Black Family Tapestry|Black family tree tapestry]].\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Wikipedia:Lucretia|Lucretia]] was a legendary Roman noblewoman who was raped by the son of the King of Rome. She told her husband and father what had happened to her and demanded they exact vengeance, then committed suicide. This led to the downfall of the Roman monarchy and the establishment of the Roman republic. The name \"Lucretia\" comes from the Roman family name ''Lucretius'', possibly derived from the Latin ''lucrum'', \"profit, wealth.\"<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/lucretia Behind the Name: Lucretia]</ref> \n\n[[Wikipedia:Lucrezia Borgia|Lucrezia Borgia]] was a Renaissance noblewoman born into a family notorious for its ruthlessness and corruption. Personally, Lucrezia was accused of incest, poisoning, and murder, but she was most likely innocent of these crimes.\n\n{{w|281 Lucretia}} is an asteroid belonging to the Flora family in the Main Belt. It was discovered by Johann Palisa on [[31 October]] [[1888]] in Vienna and named after Caroline Herschel, one of the first female astronomers, whose middle name was Lucretia. This fits with the Black family's tradition of astronomical names.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*[[Horace Slughorn]] said that all the Blacks were in [[Slytherin]] except Sirius, so therefore Lucretia, who had Slughorn as her Potions professor from c. [[1936]]-[[1943]], was likewise in Slytherin.\n*Since Lucretia and her cousin/sister-in-law [[Walburga Black]] were born on the same year, it is most likely that they were classmates at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].\n*Lucretia is depicted on the family tree tapestry very much like [[Misapinoa Black|Misapinoa Blishwick (n\u00e9e Black)]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{OOTP|F}} {{1st}} {{Comment|Appears on Black family tapestry}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Black, Lucretia}}\n[[de:Lucretia Black]]\n[[it:Lucretia Black]]\n[[ru:\u041b\u0443\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0446\u0438\u044f \u041f\u0440\u0443\u044d\u0442\u0442]]\n[[fi:Lucretia Musta]]\n[[fr:Lucretia Black]]\n[[es:Lucretia Black]]\n[[pl:Lukrecja Prewett]]\n\n[[Category:1925 births]]\n[[Category:1992 deaths]]\n[[Category:British individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts students during the Riddle-era]]\n[[Category:House of Black]]\n[[Category:Married individuals]]\n[[Category:Prewett family]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1930s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
