Susanna was a fan of [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], and was known to send him letters daily.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Susanna\" is from \u03a3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1 (Sousanna), the Greek form of the Hebrew name \u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05b9\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05e0\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4 (Shoshannah). This was derived from the Hebrew word \u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05b9\u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05df (shoshan) meaning \"lily\" (in modern Hebrew this also means \"rose\"), perhaps ultimately from Egyptian s\u0161n \"lotus\".\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*This particular student was only featured in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|PlayStation 2 version]] of {{POA}} and the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|Nintendo DS version]] of {{HBP}}.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{PS2 only}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hesleden, Susanna}}\n[[pl:Susanna Hesleden]]\n[[fr:Susanna Hesleden]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Gilderoy Lockhart's fans]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
