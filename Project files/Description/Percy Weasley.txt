[[22 August]], [[1976]]) was an [[England|English]] [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], the third child of [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Molly Weasley]] {{c|n\u00e9e Prewett}}. He was the younger brother of [[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] and the older brother of [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], [[George Weasley|George]], and the late [[Fred Weasley]]. He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1987]]-[[1994]], and was both a [[prefect]] and [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]].\n\nHe took the rules very seriously, and did not believe that [[Fred and George Weasley]] would get very far with their constant pranks. It was also once stated by his brother Ron that \"''Percy wouldn't know a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing [[Dobby]]'s tea cosy''\". A high achiever, he went to work at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] after leaving school, working in the [[Department of International Magical Co-operation]] under [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Barty Crouch Snr]] and later as [[Junior Assistant to the Minister for Magic]] himself.\n\nHowever, Percy's rise through the Ministry caused a rift between him and his family following the [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return]] of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. His father thought that his promotion to [[Minister for Magic]] [[Cornelius Fudge]]'s office was a plot by the Minister to keep tabs on the Weasleys, and through them, [[Albus Dumbledore]]. Percy denied this and remained steadfastly loyal to the Ministry's line that Voldemort was not back, estranging himself from his family and furthermore condemning them for their support of and affiliation with [[Albus Dumbledore]] and the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. Even though the Ministry did accept that the Dark Lord had indeed returned following the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], Percy's shame over his behaviour stopped him from reconciling with his family. \n\nAfter the [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|fall of the Ministry]] to the [[Death Eaters]] in [[1997]], Percy finally realised just how corrupt the Ministry was and fully accepted that he had been wrong the whole time and abandoned the Ministry. Percy was tipped off by [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] about the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]] and finally made up with his family. He survived the battle but was grief-stricken over the death of his brother Fred, whom he was fighting alongside and was determined to avenge.\n\nFollowing the downfall of Voldemort, Percy returned to work for the Ministry and became Head of the [[Department of Magical Transportation]]<ref name=\"PMRS1\"/> under the new Minister for Magic, [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]]. He married a woman named [[Audrey Weasley|Audrey]] and had two daughters, [[Molly Weasley II|Molly]], named after her paternal grandmother, and [[Lucy Weasley|Lucy]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nPercy Ignatius Weasley was the third of seven children born to [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Molly Weasley]].<ref name=\"PS\">{{PS}}</ref> He was a small child during the height of the [[First Wizarding War]]. In the fighting, his maternal uncles, [[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]] and [[Gideon Prewett]], both members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], were murdered fighting [[Antonin Dolohov]] and four other [[Death Eaters]].<ref name=\"OP\">{{OOTP}}</ref> While he was still a child, the wizarding world became peaceful again (for a time) after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s first defeat on [[31 October]], [[1981]].\n\n[[File:The Burrow.png|250px|thumb|left|[[The Burrow]], where Percy grew up along with his family]]\nPercy and his five brothers \u2014 [[William Weasley|Bill]], [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]], [[Fred Weasley|Fred]], [[George Weasley|George]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] \u2014 as well as his younger sister, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], grew up in the Burrow on the outskirts of [[Ottery St Catchpole]] in [[Devon]], England. Like all his siblings, he was home educated in reading, writing and mathematics by his mother. \n\nThe Weasley family was not wealthy at all, compared to other wizarding families. Many other [[pure-blood]] families, particularly the Malfoys, disdained them for their \"''[[blood traitor]]''\" beliefs and lack of wealth. However, this did not bother the Weasleys and they continued to stand by their beliefs. Also Molly and Arthur tried their best to make up for this with their [[love]].<ref name=\"CS\">{{COS}}</ref> When Percy was seven his five-year-old brother Fred [[Teddy bear to spider|transformed]] Ron's teddy bear into a giant [[spider]], which caused Ron's arachnophobia. This was in retaliation for Ron breaking Fred's [[toy broomstick]]. It can be assumed that Percy had a fairly happy childhood, as all the Weasley siblings did. \n\n===Hogwarts years {{C|1987\u20131994}}===\nHe started at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in September of 1987 and was sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]], where he shared a dormitory with [[Oliver Wood]]. He took a pet rat named [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]] with him, which turned out to be an Animagus named Peter Pettigrew.\n\n====Second year====\nEarly in his second year, Percy joined his two older brothers and [[Jacob's sibling]] in a study session in the [[Hogwarts Library]]. Percy introduced himself and his pet rat to this individual.<ref>{{HM|5|1}}</ref>\n\nHe and his two brothers came to [[Jacob's room]] with Jacob's sibling in order to talk to [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]].<ref>{{HM|5|6}}</ref>\n\nAt some point during the year, Scabbers went missing. During the [[Gryffindor vs Ravenclaw Quidditch match (1988\u20131989)|Gryffindor vs. Ravenclaw Quidditch match]], he caught Jacob's sibling in the [[Gryffindor Common Room]] with Jae Kim using magic outside of class.

He would also sneak into empty classrooms to be with Penelope, so as to be away from the prying eyes of his siblings, but was caught on one occasion by his youngest sister [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]]. He swore her to secrecy, and in doing so, was inadvertently responsible for the events at the end of that school year, as he prevented Ginny from telling [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and Harry about her involvement with the Chamber of Secrets, thinking that she was telling them about him and Penelope.<ref name=\"CS\"/>\n\nPercy also advised Harry on his choice of subjects for his third year,<ref name=\"COS14\"/> and later suffered an immense shock when Penelope was [[petrification|petrified]] by [[Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk|Slytherin's monster]].

During the summer of 1994, Percy worked diligently under Crouch, a man whom he admired and respected for his strict adherence to rules and his perfectionist attitude towards his work. He was responsible for authoring a dull report on standardising cauldron thickness. He also learned about the plans for the resurrection of the [[Triwizard Tournament]], which he took great delight with in hinting about to his younger siblings. He had no patience for any noise when working, and even popped his head out of the window to tell his family to be quiet. Two weeks before the Quidditch World Cup, Percy passed his [[Apparition]] test. He took to Apparating downstairs to breakfast every morning just to prove he could in fact do it.<ref name=\"GF\"/>\n\n[[File:B4C7M1 Quidditch World Cup Campsite.png|250px|thumb|The [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]] that Percy attended with his family and friends]]\nAlong with the rest of his family, he attended the Quidditch World Cup, and was embarrassed when Mr Crouch addressed him as \"Weatherby\" in front of his family. When [[Death Eaters]] caused panic after the Cup ended, Percy assisted the Ministry alongside his older brothers and father, and got a bloody nose during the job. In the weeks that followed, Percy had to work doubly hard at the Ministry to cope with the large number of [[Howler]]s that crossed his desk from the disgruntled and frightened [[Wizarding world|public]].<ref name=\"GF\"/>\n\n[[File:Yule Ball Pottermore1.png|250px|thumb|left|The [[Yule Ball]] that Percy attended as a representative of Mr Crouch]]\nPrior to the Christmas of 1994, Percy was promoted to [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Mr Crouch]]'s personal assistant, and began taking orders from him via [[Owl Postal Service|owl post]]. Crouch was supposedly ill and taking time off to recover, and it was being blamed on the stress caused by the debacle following the Quidditch World Cup. Percy took over some of Crouch's official duties, attending the Yule Ball and meeting with the [[Transylvanian Head of Magical Co-operation]] on his behalf. In February, he presided as a judge for the Second Task of the Triwizard Tournament, once again filling in for Crouch.<ref name=\"GF\"/>\n\nHowever, the discovery of a confused Crouch in the [[Forbidden Forest]] caused a stir in the Ministry. It was believed by some that he may not have been acting under his own accord, and that his instructions may have been written by someone else. Percy was called in for questioning over the affair since he had been, supposedly following Crouch's instructions, and was not allowed to take Crouch's place as judge for the Third Task, with [[Cornelius Fudge]] being sent in to fill Crouch's place instead.<ref name=\"GF\">{{GOF}}</ref> An inquiry was held, and Percy got into trouble since it was felt that he should have realised that something was amiss with Crouch and informed a superior.<ref name=\"OP\">{{OOTP}}</ref>\n\n===Second Wizarding War {{C|1995\u20131998}}===\n====Disowning his family====\n{{Quote|He went completely berserk...

Surprisingly, despite the trouble he was previously in, Percy was offered the position of [[Junior Assistant to the Minister for Magic|Junior Assistant to Fudge]] himself. He expected his family to be pleased with him, but his father, who supported Harry and Dumbledore, made it clear that he thought that Percy had been offered the post so that Fudge could keep track of the family, [[Harry Potter|Harry]], and Dumbledore. Following this, Percy and his father had a huge row, with Percy telling his father that he had to struggle against his lousy reputation since he had started at the Ministry, that he had no ambition, and that was the reason the family was so poor. He also told his father that he was an idiot for believing [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] and his loyalty remained with the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. He also rubbished Harry's claim that Lord Voldemort had returned, saying it was not good enough.<ref name=\"OP\"/>\n\nPercy severed all ties with his family, wanting everyone to know that he had nothing to do with them. He packed his bags the same night and left. He moved to [[London]] where he was able to get himself a [[Percy Weasley's London residence|flat]], and continued with the position in Fudge's office. His mother went to London to try to talk with him, but Percy slammed the door in her face.

To Harry's surprise and dismay, Percy refused to look at him, and even agreed with one of Fudge's biased comments against Harry. Following the hearing, despite Harry being cleared of all charges, Percy believed that Harry only got off due to a technicality, and he also ignored his father, who was waiting outside for Harry. Percy's estrangement from his family continued, although he did [[Percy Weasley's letter to Ronald Weasley (1995) II|write]] a letter to [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], congratulating him on becoming a [[prefect]] and urging him to stop associating with Harry (who he felt was a bad influence) as well as believing that his family would one day realise their mistake for believing Dumbledore and apologise to him. Finding the letter extremely offensive, Ron tore it up and threw it into the fire. This letter also greatly hurt Harry's feelings. On the same day, Percy gave an interview to the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' concerning [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s appointment as [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor]].<ref name=\"OP\"/>\n\nLater that year during Christmas, Percy returned his traditional Christmas jumper to his mother unopened without a note, much to her distress, and neither visited his father in [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] nor at least asked about him following his wounding by [[Nagini]], much to Fred and George's fury.<ref name=\"OP\"/>\n\n[[File:D.A._caught.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Percy with Harry Potter in Dumbledore's office after the discovery of Dumbledore's Army]]\nIn early 1996, Percy was one of the Ministry officials summoned to Hogwarts following Professor Umbridge's discovery of the secret organisation, [[Dumbledore's Army]]. Percy kept a firm grip on Harry's shoulder to hold him firmly in place and once again acted as a scribe for Fudge. He left after being ordered to make a copy of his notes for the ''Daily Prophet'', thus avoiding the fate that awaited the remaining officials. Dumbledore, with no intentions of being taken to Azkaban then proceeded to knock out Umbridge, Fudge, Kingsley, and [[John Dawlish|Dawlish]] and made his escape.<ref name=\"OP\" />\n\n[[File:Auror Dawlish, Cornelius Fudge and Percy Weasley.JPG|250px|thumb|John Dawlish, Cornelius Fudge, and Percy see Voldemort inside the Ministry of Magic]]\nFollowing the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], Percy now knew the truth about [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s return, but continued to side with the Ministry because he couldn't bring himself to face his family after seeing that they were right all along when siding with Harry and Dumbledore and he was wrong for siding with the Ministry, feeling shame over it. When Fudge was succeeded by [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] as Minister, Percy continued in his role as Junior Assistant. His mother masked this defection by claiming that Percy was too busy in the Ministry to return for the holidays, when in reality, the last thing Percy wanted to do was be around his estranged family.<ref name=\"HBP\"/>\n\nDuring Christmas in [[1996]], Percy was pressured by Rufus Scrimgeour to go to [[The Burrow]] with him. Scrimgeour was using the visit as a pretence to have a talk with Harry, who was spending Christmas there. Scrimgeour exploited Percy's family connections to get close to Harry, and Percy was very uncomfortable with seeing his family again, as he had not planned to see them for the holidays. His mother was overjoyed to see him and immediately ran to hug him, while his father and siblings simply stared at him coldly. Percy only spoke to his mother (and rather briefly and reluctantly, at that), and the visit ended badly with Percy storming out after [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], [[Fred and George Weasley|Fred, and George]] flung mashed parsnips at him.

On the same day, the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] was overthrown by [[Death Eaters]], and Rufus Scrimgeour was killed and replaced by [[Pius Thicknesse]], a puppet of Voldemort's. Percy finally began to see what was happening around him, but could do nothing since he was being watched closely. He continued to work at the Ministry, presumably under the new Minister.

In a tense moment, Percy apologised profusely to his family, and his brother [[Fred Weasley|Fred]], who, along with [[George Weasley|George]], were the most vocal in their anger towards Percy, was the first to forgive him.

Full of anger and sorrow, Percy stormed back into battle, charging after Death Eater [[Augustus Rookwood]], who was attacking a group of students further down the corridor.<ref name=\"DH\"/>\n\n[[File:WeasleysHermioneyKingsley Battle of Hogwarts HPDH2.jpg|250px|thumb|Percy stands with his family and friends during the battle]]\nDuring the one-hour armistice, Percy mourned Fred with his family in the Great Hall. He was also present when Voldemort announced Harry's \"supposed\" death, looking shocked and saddened, as he had once again came to consider Harry a friend. When the second half of the battle broke out, he joined forces in the Great Hall and with the help of his father was able to floor Thicknesse. Percy also witnessed the [[Duel between Molly Weasley and Bellatrix Lestrange|slaying]] of [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] at the hands of his mother, along with Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort bringing about the end of the Second Wizarding War.<ref name=\"DH\">{{DH}}</ref> \n\n[[File:Weasleys after battle.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Percy with his family after the Battle]]\nIn the aftermath of the battle, it can be assumed that Percy was one of the people who rushed to Harry's side and attempted to hug him. He later sat with his family in silence and mourning. He was sitting next to his father and across from his mother, sister, and George. The family, while rejoicing the end of the Second Wizarding War, was also devastated over the loss of Fred.<ref name=\"DH\"/>\n\n===Later life===\n{{Quote|A new, improved Percy ended up as a high-ranking official in the new Ministry of Magic under Kingsley.|[[J.

He wore horn-rimmed glasses, and also tried to carry himself in a dignified manner, although he usually came off looking pretentious and silly.\n\nBy [[2014]], [[Rita Skeeter]] noticed Percy had \"''aged considerably since the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]''\" and was \"''greying and balding''\".<ref name=\"PMRS1\"/>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Percy wouldn't recognise a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing [[Dobby]]'s tea-cosy.|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] on Percy's lack of humour|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\n[[File:Percy.jpg|200px|thumb|Percy Weasley as a [[prefect]] in his sixth year]]\nPercy was extremely ambitious and dedicated to his goals, which was apparently to become [[Minister for Magic]], though it is possible that it was just Fred and George joking.<ref name=\"CS\" /> A stickler for rules and regulations, he respected authority and, when he attained it himself, expected respect in return. However, Percy usually just seemed affected and self-important since he constantly tried to look and sound dignified, including calling his parents \"Mother\" and \"Father\" rather than \"Mum\" and \"Dad\" like the rest of his siblings.<ref name=\"PA\" /> He had a sophisticated way of speaking, thinking it made him sound flamboyant, but he simply came off as pompous and grandiose.\n\nPercy was also highly opinionated, and made loud comments regarding the [[Sirius Black]] situation and the measures he would suggest when he made it into the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].<ref name=\"PA\" /> He was also very dismissive of [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]]'s skills in running the [[Department of Magical Games and Sports]] when compared to Mr Crouch, but that didn't stop him attempting to make a good impression in front of him when he met him at the Quidditch World Cup.<ref name=\"GF\" />\n\nPercy was extremely pompous, arrogant, and stiff-necked; he took himself very seriously and was often the butt of pranks and jokes played on him by his fun-loving siblings. \n\nHowever, he showed rare glimmerings of a sense of humour when joking with [[Penelope Clearwater]] over sabotaging Harry's broomstick,<ref name=\"GF\" /> and when [[duelling]] Pius Thicknesse during the Battle of Hogwarts.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\nPercy could be snobbish and bossy at times, as Fred and George have said, but he also cared about his family at the end, although sometimes when it was too late. He was also very pompous and when he wanted to get something, he sometimes only cared about himself rather than his family. He cared immensely about his own self-image and always tried to appear sophisticated, intelligent and upper-class, but only succeeded at becoming narcissistic, coarse and rather insensitive.  \n\nAlthough not a strongly prejudiced person at heart, Percy's huge loyalty to the Ministry made him support some of their prejudiced policies when he was employed by them. This was first shown when he defended Barty Crouch Snr when he sacked his loyal house elf [[Winky]] for associating him with the Dark Mark (and secretly, for failing to properly supervise his son) even though she was seemingly at the wrong place and time, claiming that Ministry officials like Crouch required unswerving loyalty from their house elves, even though it put his friendship with Hermione under strain when she was angered by Percy's insensitivity and ignorance to Winky's feelings and the welfare of house-elves in general. Even though Percy was already aware of Harry's ability to speak [[Parseltongue]], it also ensured that he was easily swayed by Rita Skeeter's [[HARRY POTTER \"DISTURBED AND DANGEROUS\"|slanderous article]] about Harry being disturbed and dangerous, to the point that he no longer considered Harry trustworthy and disbelieved his claims of Voldemort's return.<ref name=\"GF\" /> He later also supported the Ministry with their legislations and prejudice against werewolves and half-giants when they were attempting to discredit Dumbledore, not protesting when the Ministry [[MINISTRY SEEKS EDUCATIONAL REFORM|criticised]] Dumbledore's decision to employ [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Rubeus Hagrid]] at Hogwarts. He also showed prejudice against his [[Arthur Weasley|father's]] position in the Ministry, claiming when he disowned his family that he had to struggle against his father's reputation since he started working for the Ministry and that Arthur had no ambition which was why their family was always poor, even though the Ministry's prejudice against Arthur's Pro-Muggle leanings made them unwilling to promote him to a higher position.<ref name=\"OP\" /> \n\nPercy developed a rather cruel, elitist and callous personality after he estranged himself from his family, having a scornful attitude towards his parents and siblings due to their support for [[Albus Dumbledore]], and became very dismissive towards [[Harry Potter]], whom he had been supportive towards previously. This showed his dishonesty and desperation to become something higher in the Ministry. At [[Christmas]] [[1995]], he spitefully returned his mother's present unopened, and refused to visit his father in [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]]; both of these cruel acts really hurt his family, but he did not seem to care for their feelings.<ref name=\"OP\"/> He became delusional, untrustworthy, ignorant and power-hungry, much like his idol [[Cornelius Fudge]], and inaccurately believed [[Dolores Umbridge]] to be a good-natured woman, despite her true sadistic and hateful nature, while at the same time wrongly believing Harry, Dumbledore and his family to be liars.<ref name=\"OP\"/> After his family and Dumbledore were proven to be right and the Ministry wrong, Percy was too ashamed of his past cruelty towards them,<ref name=\"HBP\"/> that he felt himself unable to reconcile with them, and even missed Bill's wedding.<ref name=\"DH\"/>\n\nPercy proved himself to be very much of a social climber. He wanted to achieve prominence at the Ministry, choosing to dedicate himself to the institution and abandoning his family when they chose to rebel against the Ministry. He was a sychophant, constantly trying to suck up to Barty Crouch Snr or Fudge, despite the former not knowing his actual name. His love of order and rules, and obedience to authorities blinded him to the truth about Lord Voldemort's return and he felt ashamed after learning the truth and couldn't bring himself to see his family. It even made him miss out on three important events of his family: the joining of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], a visit to his [[Attack on Arthur Weasley|injured]] father,<ref name=\"OP\" /> and his [[William Weasley|eldest brother]]'s [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]]. Despite this, however, Percy is not entirely without reason, as after the Ministry fell and was taken over by the Death Eaters, Percy finally realised his wrongs and admitted to them and apologised sincerely to his family, reconciling with them.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\nDespite his normal determination to maintain proper behaviour, Percy was an avid fan of [[Quidditch]] and could sometimes forget decorum in demonstrating his enthusiasm for it. In the [[1993-1994 school year]], he made a 10 Galleon bet with Penelope Clearwater that Gryffindor would win the Gryffindor vs. Ravenclaw Quidditch match, despite the fact that he didn't have ten Galleons at the time.<ref name=\"PA13\">{{POA|B|13}}</ref> Later that year, when Gryffindor won the final match of the season, vs. [[Slytherin]], Percy jumped \"''up and down like a maniac, all dignity forgotten.''\"<ref name=\"PA15\">{{POA|B|15}}</ref>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n{{Quote|His exam results came the day before [[Harry Potter|you]] did; twelve O.W.L.s and he hardly gloated at all.|[[Fred Weasley]] regarding Percy's academic prowess|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\nPercy was a very skilled and talented wizard.

His academic studies and responsible nature earned him praise and adoration in the eyes of his mother and father, although even [[Arthur Weasley|Mr Weasley]] was not above having a small laugh at the expense of his son's stuffiness.<ref name=\"PA\" /> However, his behaviour alienated him from his younger siblings, especially [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]], who were the exact opposite of him. Because of this, Percy was a constant butt of their jokes and pranks, including bewitching his prefect and Head Boy badges to read ''Pinhead''<ref name=\"CS\" /> and ''Bighead Boy''<ref name=\"PA\" /> respectively, and sending [[dragon]] dung to his office at the Ministry.<ref name=\"GF\" /> However, the twins' pranks were generally good-natured ribbing at his expense \u2014 during Christmas in [[1991]], the twins forbade him from sitting with the other prefects, noting that Christmas was a time for family.<ref name=\"PS\" /> He tried to be a role-model for [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], but they took after the fun-loving twins.\n\nIn [[1995]], he broke off all ties with his family following an argument with his father over his promotion to Junior Assistant to Fudge. Proud and ambitious, he could not conceive that Fudge would be using him to spy on Dumbledore. He could also not see that both the Ministry and the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' were not telling the public the truth over the return of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. When the truth was revealed, he felt ashamed about his actions and guiltily shunned his family until the moment that he might have lost them during the Battle of Hogwarts, even though he had been wanting to apologise to them for some time, at which Percy sincerely apologised to them and was forgiven by them all.\n\nCuriously enough, while it was the twins who were the most angry at him within the family, constantly telling the others that he was no good and to forget about him, it was also Fred and George who were the first to forgive him and welcome him back to the family. Fred was the first to forgive him, while George seemed to carry on as if the split had never occurred, and made a small joke about Percy having been a prefect.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\n[[File:Fred dead.gif|250px|thumb|The Weasley family gathered round Fred's dead body]]\nOver the years, Percy was particularly proud and protective of his youngest brother, Ron. During Ron's first year, Percy was extremely proud that he had beaten [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]'s enchanted chess set that guarded the [[Philosopher's Stone]].<ref name=\"PS\" /> During the Second Task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]], he rushed to help him from the lake after he had been rescued by Harry Potter.<ref name=\"GF\" /> After severing ties with his family, Ron was the only one he contacted, congratulating him on becoming a prefect, and urging him to cut his ties with Harry Potter so that he would not be dragged down with him, although this only disgusted Ron even further.<ref name=\"OP\" /> Finally, after reconciling with his family, in the brief ceasefire allowed to them by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Percy comforted Ron following Fred's death, which also devastated him. Through the marriage of his brother [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], Percy became brother-in-law to [[Fleur Delacour]].<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\n====Audrey Weasley====\nIn later life, Percy married a woman named [[Audrey Weasley|Audrey]], and the couple had two children, [[Molly Weasley II|Molly]] and [[Lucy Weasley|Lucy]].<ref name=\"WFT\" />\n\n====Harry Potter====\n{{Quote|Well done, Harry! Ten Galleons to me!

He considered Harry a bad influence for Ron and sent him [[Percy Weasley's letter to Ronald Weasley (1995) II|a letter]] encouraging him to sever ties with Harry and to stay on Umbridge's good side so that he could become eligible for [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]]ship in a few years. Although Harry attempted to make light of the letter's content, Ron promptly tore it to pieces and threw it in the fire, calling Percy \"''the world's biggest git''\". At that point, Harry hated Percy for not believing in him, for not giving him recognition in the [[Disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter|disciplinary hearing]], and for accepting Fudge's mockeries.<ref name=\"OP\" /> Percy finally came to his senses when the Ministry fell to Voldemort, and he fought alongside Harry in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. This appeared to have caused Harry to forgive Percy and consider him an ally again, as he went to some lengths as to try to make him move to avoid the oncoming attacks from Death Eaters despite the risk on himself. At this point, Percy seemed to have lost what enmity he had towards Harry, looking visibly sombre and saddened as Harry's dead body was brought before Hogwarts. After Voldemort's death, he is among those who hugged Harry for his victory over Voldemort, Harry's lack of protest showing his better views of Percy.\n\nThey later became brothers-in-law through Harry's marriage to Ginny. However, their relationship remained distant as while seeing both of his sons go to Hogwarts, Harry thought he overheard Percy talking loudly about [[broomstick regulations]], and was glad to have the excuse not to stop and say hello but while he apparently preferred to not interact with Percy, he no longer hated Percy and had forgiven him and apparently decided to leave how badly Percy treated him once in the past.\n\n====Hermione Granger====\n[[File:Hermione Granger Half Blood Prince.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Hermione Granger]], his future sister-in-law]]\nFrom 1991-1994, Percy was on very good terms with Hermione Granger, due to their academic brilliance and strong work ethic. Just after her [[Sorting Hat|Sorting]], Hermione talked to Percy about her enthusiasm about learning magic, particularly [[Transfiguration]], and it is likely that she admired him for being a Prefect, and being as academically brilliant as her. It is mentioned that Hermione got on with Percy better than the rest of the Weasleys. Their bond was broken after the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]], when Percy condemned his boss's house-elf [[Winky]], and Hermione was angry at his unfairness, having recently realised how badly [[house-elves]] were treated. They were never again as close, and when Percy broke ties with his family, this generally included Hermione as she was closely associated with the Weasleys and Harry. Hermione eventually became Percy's sister-in-law, and the relationship between them is unknown.\n\n===Penelope Clearwater===\n{{Quote|He's been meeting her all over the school in secret.  I walked in on them kissing in an empty classroom one day.  He was so upset when she was \u2014 you know \u2014 attacked.  You won't tease him, will you?|[[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] on Percy and Penelope|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\n[[File:Pepe4.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Penelope Clearwater, his Hogwarts girlfriend]]\nPercy began dating [[Penelope Clearwater]], a fellow [[prefect]], sometime during his fifth year. She boosted his morale by a tonne, and he flaunted himself even more, though he kept his relationship secret from his family, not wanted to be laughed at by anyone else. They would meet in deserted classrooms to kiss, but were caught once by Percy's sister, Ginny. Percy was distraught when Penelope was [[petrification|petrified]] in [[1993]], and immensely relieved when she was cured by Professor Sprout's Mandrake potion. The secrecy was broken when Ginny revealed the truth to her brothers, asking them not to tease Percy over the fact, which they did anyway.<ref name=\"CS\" />\n\nWith the secret out, Percy and Penelope appeared in public together, and he kept a photo of her. During his stay at the [[Leaky Cauldron]] before the start of his seventh year, he accused Ron of dripping tea on it.<ref name=\"PA\" /> He met her on platform 9\u00be, showing off his Head Boy badge, and, later in the year, wagered ten [[Galleon]]s on the outcome of the [[Gryffindor]] vs. [[Ravenclaw]] match, despite not actually having ten galleons. He playfully remarked to her about sabotaging Harry's [[Harry Potter's Firebolt|Firebolt]] when she asked if she could touch it.<ref name=\"PA\" />\n\nThey presumably broke up later, as Percy married [[Audrey Weasley|another woman]].\n\n===Bartemius Crouch Senior===\n{{Quote|They'll be announcing their engagement any day soon...|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] on Percy and Crouch|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\n[[File:Roger Lloyd Pack as Barty Crouch Snr (GoF-promo-02).jpg|200px|thumb|[[Bartemius Crouch Senior]], his former boss whom he heavily fawned over]]\nPercy Weasley worked under Crouch for thirteen months and was absolutely obsessed with him: indeed, Percy's brother Ronald joked in August of 1994 that he should be expecting their engagement any day.<ref name=\"GOF5\"/> Crouch, however, cannot remember Percy's name: as a running gag, he referred to his protege as \"Weatherby\". Percy's admiration of Crouch was so strong that he defended Crouch when his brothers mocked him and when Crouch sacked [[Winky]], putting his friendship with [[Hermione Granger]] under strain when she condemned Crouch's seemingly unreasonable act.\n\nAfter Voldemort subjugated Crouch and forced him to write letters to declare sickness, Weasley obeyed the orders via these letters unquestioningly. This eventually got Percy into trouble, as when Crouch escaped and was seen delirious on Hogwarts ground, the Ministry accused Percy of being irresponsible and unperceptive, that he should have seen the written orders as potential forgeries and that he should have informed a superior of Crouch's questionable status.\n\nIt is unknown what Percy thought of Crouch after the man had been found insane in the [[Forbidden Forest]] and participated in breaking out his criminal son from Azkaban, and it is unknown how Percy reacted when learning of his death.\n\nCrouch also indirectly proved to be a major factor for Percy's huge loyalty to the Ministry and his temporary estrangement from his own family, especially as his twin brothers Fred and George Weasley started teasing him more and his younger brother Ron stopped trusting him after learning of Crouch's son. Additionally, the trouble Percy got into over Crouch's disappearance only made him more ambitious to the point that he accepted the post of Junior Assistant to the Minister for Magic under Fudge without question, and put his Ministry career before his own family when Voldemort returned to full power, just as Crouch had done.\n\n===Cornelius Fudge===\n[[File:Corneliushogwarts.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Cornelius Fudge]], his former Ministry superior]]\nCornelius Fudge originally looked down on Percy's [[Weasley family|family]] due to their affiliation with Muggles; however, in 1995 as an attempt to spy on the Weasley family and through them, Albus Dumbledore, Fudge promoted Percy to become his Junior Minister. Ironically, this led to Percy's defection from his family. Percy commented in his [[Percy Weasley's letter to Ronald Weasley (1995) II|letter]] to his younger brother [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] that the Minister would not be more gracious to him for this defection. He agreed with Fudge on that Harry was violent and disturbed, as that Dumbledore was plotting to overthrow Fudge when the Ministry began publishing articles.\n\nOver the final year of Fudge's term as Minister, he used Percy as the court scribe on at least two occasions: [[Disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter|Harry's disciplinary hearing]] and the meeting in the Headmaster's Office following the [[Dumbledore's Army#Discovery|discovery of Dumbledore's Army]]. Percy, during both moments, heartily agreed with Fudge's decisions, and laughed when Fudge made insulting mockeries at Harry and Dumbledore. When Fudge's folly had been exposed and he was forced to resign as Minister in disgrace, Percy remained loyal to the Ministry; it is unknown how he reacted to Fudge's dismissal.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{W|Percy (given name)|Percy}} is a short form of the name ''Percival'', which is derived from Old French, meaning \"pierce the veil\". It was the name of one of the Knights of the Round Table in Arthurian legend. This may be a pattern in names in the [[Weasley family]], as Percy's [[Arthur Weasley|father]] is named ''{{W|King Arthur|Arthur}}'' and his [[Ginevra Weasley|sister]] is named ''Ginevra'', a version of {{W|Guinevere}}. Percival is also one of [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s middle names, and Albus formerly had reddish (auburn) hair, suggesting a possible link between the two families. It can also be short for Perseus, which is derived from Ancient Greek, meaning \"destroyer\". It could possibly be clues for him destroying his relationship with his family.\n\nThe namesake for Percy's middle name, Ignatius, was likely his [[Molly Weasley|mother]]'s uncle [[Ignatius Prewett]]<ref>{{OOTP|B|6}} -[[Sirius Black]] stated that Molly Weasley was his \"cousin by marriage\". This means that Ignatius could not have been Molly, Fabian, and Gideon's father, as this would have made them first cousins by blood of Sirius. Ignatius was Sirius's uncle by marriage, and if Molly was his niece, this could explain Sirius's comment. See this [[Talk:Ignatius Prewett|talk page]] for more information.</ref>. Ignatius is a Roman name altered from its original Etruscan to resemble the Latin ''ignis'', meaning \"fire\". It was the name of several saints, including the founder of the Jesuits.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/ignatius Behind the Name: Ignatius]</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Percy_Weasley_1.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Chris Rankin as Percy in ''Deathly Hallows: Part 2'']]\n[[File:Ecry.jpg|150px|thumb|Percy as seen in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]\n*Percy is portrayed by [[New Zealand]] actor [[Chris Rankin]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]] of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Chamber of Secrets]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix]]'',''' '''{{DH|F1}} and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Part 2]]''.\n*In the ''Harry Potter'' [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]], Percy is shown without glasses.\n*Percy's middle name, Ignatius, probably is from his [[Ignatius Prewett|great-uncle]].\n*Percy and [[Audrey Weasley|his wife]] named their oldest daughter [[Molly Weasley II|Molly]], after [[Molly Weasley|Percy's mother]].\n*One trait that Percy had in common with his first two bosses [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Bartemius Crouch Snr]] and [[Cornelius Fudge]] was that he was willing to put his career ambitions over anything else, including the relationships with his family and friends. However, unlike Fudge and Crouch Snr, Percy was able to break out of this mould after seeing the error of his ways. Additionally Percy never had to go through an incident that would have destroyed his reputation at the Ministry.\n*While {{OOTP|FA}} did show Percy as one of Fudge's supporters, it omitted the details of Percy becoming Fudge's Junior Assistant or any mention of him defecting from his family, when he decided to remain obedient to the Ministry and accept their story that Voldemort had not returned.\n*Due to Percy being reduced to a background character in {{DH|F2}}, the films never acknowledged Percy's estrangement from his family or the apology he made to them during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].\n*Percy is omitted from the film adaptations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]''.\n*Out of the six films he was used in, Percy only had a speaking appearance in the first three films, while he has no dialogue in the fifth, seventh, and eighth films.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Percy Weasley}}\n*{{PS}} {{1st}}\n*{{PS|F}}\n*{{PS|G}}\n*{{COS}}\n*{{COS|F}}\n*{{COS|G}}\n*{{POA}}\n*{{POA|F}}\n*{{GOF}}\n*{{OOTP}}\n*{{OOTP|F}}\n*{{HBP}}\n*{{DH}}\n*{{DH|F1}} {{C|Cameo}}\n*{{DH|F2}}\n*{{PM}}\n*{{WW}}\n*''[[J.K.
