Despite their [[Scamander brothers' mother|mother]]'s hobby of breeding fancy [[Hippogriff]]s, Theseus evidently never shared his brother's interest in the field of [[Magizoology]], and regarded caring of magical creatures as a fine way of passing the time, but did not take it seriously as a professional pursuit. This was an opinion he apparently had in common with his mother, as neither of them seemed to be very impressed with his younger brother's career.\n\nAt some point, he bought or inherited a [[Theseus Scamander's wand|wand]].\n\n===Hogwarts years===\nDuring his formative years, he attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], having been [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff]],<ref name=\"SnitchSeeker\"/> where he excelled in his studies and proved himself an academically gifted student. Proficient in both the theoretical aspects of his lessons and savvy in regard to their practical application, he would finish his education earning at least five [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.s]], with top grades of either 'Outstanding' or 'Exceeds Expectations'.<ref name=\"ootp29\">{{OOTP|B|29}} - Minerva McGonagall establishes that Aurors require a minimum of five N.E.W.T.s, and nothing under 'Exceeds Expectations' in order to be eligible for training to join the Auror Office.</ref>\n\n===Early career===\nAt some point after he finished his magical education, Theseus would join the [[British Ministry of Magic]], and complete a stringent series of character and aptitude tests to become a fully-fledged applicant for individuals wishing to work at the [[Auror Office]] in the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]], which he would eventually do after he successfully satisfied the requirements necessary to join their ranks by passing their notoriously demanding [[Auror training|training programme]].\n\n===First World War===\nAs an official [[Auror|Dark Wizard catcher]], Theseus Scamander was not one to sit idly by while others were in danger. As such, when the Muggle world entered a period marked by a massive, military conflict that became known as the [[First World War]], he would go on to be counted among the \"''thousands''\" who defied the then Minister for Magic [[Archer Evermonde]]'s [[Archer Evermonde's emergency legislation|emergency legislation]] that forbade the British wizarding community to get involved in the hostilities.<ref>{{WW|ministers-for-magic}}</ref> While not decisive, Theseus' participation in the [[wizardkind|wizarding]] effort of the war was nevertheless a distinguished one; earning him widespread recognition as a very powerful and commanding British Auror, as well as a war hero for his life-saving actions.\n\n===Global wizarding war===\nA considerably hard-working and conscientious man, Theseus would continue to work for the Ministry following his return to Britain and rose to become a very high-ranking and well-respected Auror indeed, to the point where, when a [[Dark Wizard]] by the name of [[Gellert Grindelwald]] became active in the [[wizarding world]] and whose charismatic idealism had begun to muster support for the cause of bringing about the annulment of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]] and subsequently earned him the discontent of both Theseus's own superiors as well as the [[International Confederation of Wizards]], Theseus was assigned by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] to leave for [[Europe]] to help track him down. A notable achievement, considering the fact that the whole department wanted the case. At the time, he had no knowledge of his brother's whereabouts, whose work for the [[Dragon Research and Restraint Bureau]] involved extensive, research-related travelling, Theseus excitedly wrote him an [[Theseus Scamander's letter to Newton Scamander|owl]] and told him of his mission; wishing him well \"''wherever ''[he was]\" on \"''whatever beastly quests ''[he was]'' undertaking!''\".<ref>{{see image|File:Theseus Scamander's letter.png}}</ref> While his efforts to \"ferret out\" the aspiring revolutionary ultimately proved unsuccessful,<ref>{{FB|2017}} - Newt confirms in the foreword that he was the first person ever to capture Grindelwald.</ref> he was nevertheless eventually promoted to the Head of the Auror Office.\n\n====Hunt for Gellert Grindelwald====\nAs the [[For the Greater Good|revolutionary endeavours]] of Grindelwald grew ever fiercer and the number of individuals who joined his cause began to increase steadily, with both Grindelwald and his supporters having began launching several devastating attacks across Europe, aimed at exposing wizardkind, and provoke war with the Muggle world, any help Theseus could have provided in opposing him were most likely halted by people in authority such as [[Minister]] [[Hector Fawley]], who did not take the threat Grindelwald and his legion of fanatics seriously, seen as he was still working nationally by the mid-[[1920s]].\n\nIn [[1926]], Theseus corresponded with the man whom he assumed to be [[Percival Graves]], the [[Director of Magical Security]] of [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]], regarding recent events in [[New York]],<ref name=\"collider\" /><ref name=\"snitchseeker\" /> unaware that the man with whom he communicated was actually [[Gellert Grindelwald]] himself, in disguise.\n\n====Engagement====\n[[File:Newt Theseus Leta and Bunty at Flourish and Blotts.jpg|250px|thumb|Theseus with Newt, Leta and Bunty during launch at Flourish and Blotts]]\nBy [[1927]], [[Leta Lestrange]], a friend of Newt's from their school years, had become his fianc\u00e9e. Theseus was going to marry her on [[6 June]], [[1928]], and Newt was supposed to be their best man. On [[19 March]], [[1927]]<ref name=\"image\">{{See image|File:Fantastic-Beasts-book-launch .jpg}}</ref> Theseus, alongside Leta and his brother's assistant, [[Bunty]], participated in the ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'' [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them book launch party|launch party]] at [[Flourish and Blotts]] in [[Diagon Alley]].\n\n====Newt Scamander's appealing====\n[[File:Comission.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|Theseus with Travers, Spielman and Guzman during Newt's appealing]]\nThree months after [[Gellert Grindelwald's escape]], Newt Scamander was appealing to revoke his travel ban for the fifth time. Theseus was included in his commission along with Torquil Travers, [[Rudolph Spielman]] and [[Arnold Guzman]]. Before entering the room, he warned Newton to behave more decently than usual. During appealing, he revealed to Newt that [[Credence Barebone]], the [[Obscurial]], survived and had been sighted in Europe. They offered to restore Newt's travel rights if he will join the Ministry as an Auror and will kill Barebone. When Newt refused and walked out of the meeting, [[Gunnar Grimmson]], the bounty hunter, had been hired to assasinate Credence. Theseus was infuriated about that and approached Newt outside the commission, telling him that eventually he would be forced to choose a side. Newt refused to do this, but Theseus embraced him to say goodbye and whispered to him that he was watched by the Ministry.\n\n====Questioning of Albus Dumbledore====\n[[File:Dumbledore interrogated.jpg|220x220px|thumb|Theseus during questioning of Albus Dumbledore]]\nShortly after, Newt was sent to Paris to save Credence from Grindelwald by Albus Dumbledore. When rumours of Newt's potential travel to France reached the British Ministry of Magic, Theseus along with Travers, Leta and a few Aurors were sent to [[Hogwarts Castle]] to question Dumbledore. Angered Travers cuffed Dumbledore into Admonitors and forbaded him from ever teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts again, after Dumbledore refused to fight Grindelwald for him. Leaving the classroom, Theseus was warned by Dumbledore, that if he ever trusted him, he should not let Travers to send himself at [[Gellert Grindelwald's Paris rally|Grindelwald's rally]].\n\n====French Ministry of Magic====\n[[File:Theseus kiss with Leta.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|Theseus kissing Leta and promissing to be careful]]\nDuring a visit in the [[French Ministry of Magic Headquarters|French Ministry of Magic]], Theseus participated in the deliberations during which he learned that Grindelwald was convening a rally for his supporters. After providing this information to Leta, he kissed her. The woman asked her fianc\u00e9 and told him to promise that he would be careful, which Scamander agreed, and then told her that rumours were circulating about that Credence might be her missing brother. In reply, Leta said that her brother died. Theseus agreed with her, but also noticed that the documents would confirm it, because they never lied and left her.\n\nTheseus also hesitantly listened to [[Torquil Travers]], whom he had been at odds with for a long time. Travers ordered him to arrest everyone at Grindelwald's rally. Scamander tried to protest, because too strong a reaction could bring the opposite effect, but his supervisor stated that it was an order and therefore not subject to discussion.\n[[File:Theseus trying to attack Newt and Tina.jpg|220x220px|thumb|Theseus trying to attack Newt and Tina]]\nSeconds after exchanging sentences with Travers, Theseus covered [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]] and Newt, which used a [[Polyjuice potion]] with Theseus' hair to break into the Ministry headquarters without being wanted. Furious Theseus pursued them and caught up with Newt, on whose sight had been triggered by an alarm, because polyjuice stopped working. Older brother tried to stop them by casting a spell, but Tina blasted him into a wall and tied him up.\n\n====Grindelwald's rally====\n[[File:Theseus at Grindelwald's rally.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|Theseus during Grindelwald's rally]]\nAt [[Cimeti\u00e8re du P\u00e8re-Lachaise]] Theseus ordered the [[Auror]]s to break up Grindelwald's rally. However, he defied Travers by saying that listening to Grindelwald was legal. Grindelwald recognised the group and portrayed them as violent and those who imprisoned and tortured him in New York in search of the truth. Then, one [[Red-haired young witch|witch]] attacked an auror named [[Cassius Bell]], but he killed her in self-defence, which caused Grindelwald to sent his followers to spread the word and began the fight. Theseus was the one who gave the word to engage Grindelwald in combat, provoking him into [[Protego Diabolica|conjuring a black ring of fire]]. He listened to him threaten them into joining him or accepting death as the alternative. After virtually everyone had made their decision, Theseus joining Newt in a double spell projected to deflect Grindelwald's fire. Leta interfered and sadly expressed her love for Theseus and Newt. She proceeded to distract their enemy by stunning [[Vinda Rosier]], horrifying Theseus as Grindelwald turned and directed the fire into her flesh while he could only frantically throw up protective barriers. Leta shouted at him to leave in her final moments, but he refused to leave without her, refusing to accept that she was sacrificing herself for their safety. Newt grabbed his hand, forcing him to Disapparate by his side.\n[[File:Theseus fighting with flames.jpg|220x220px|thumb|Theseus fighting with the flames]]\nGrindelwald Disapparated, but he unleashed deadly fire outside the mausoleum before he fled the scene. Theseus, Newt, Tina, [[Yusuf Kama]], [[Nagini]] and [[Jacob Kowalski]] were close to death, but [[Nicolas Flamel]] arrived and instructed Scamander brothers, Porpentina and Kama to use the [[General Counter-Spell]]. Theseus listened to his advice and stuck his wand into the ground and helped defeat Grindelwald's fire. Theseus, horrified at the loss of his fiancee, started crying, and Newt, also saddened, hugged his older brother.<ref>https://www.pottermore.com/news/fantastic-beasts-film-title-revealed-the-crimes-of-grindelwald</ref>\n\n====Back to Hogwarts====\n[[File:Hogwarts Entrance TCOG.jpeg|220x220px|thumb|left|Theseus and others at Hogwarts]]\nAfter the battle, Theseus, travelled along with Newt and other survivors back to Hogwarts, picking up on the way Travers and Spielman. He forbade Travers to meddle in the conversation between Newt and Dumbledore, and also got rid of the admonitors, which Travers had conjured up earlier, while allowing Newt to deliver [[Gellert Grindelwald's pendant|Grindelwald's pendant]] to Dumbledore.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nTheseus was frequently described as being \"very powerful\" and was noted to be \"commanding\".<ref name=\"collider\"/><ref name=\"snitchseeker\"/> Given his participation in the [[First World War]], and his description as a hero, he appeared also to be extremely brave, and was therefore quite respected among [[International Confederation of Wizards]] officials. Theseus is highly intelligent, as he was academically gifted in both the theoretical aspects of his lessons, as well as their practical applications. In stark contrast to his anti-social younger brother [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], Theseus is rather confident and outgoing.\n\nDespite this bossy and prim reputation, Theseus is a well-meaning, hard-working, noble, and responsible man, in true [[Hufflepuff]] fashion not allowing his status as a war hero to make him arrogant or conceited, and seemingly attempting to act as a good role model to his younger brother Newt Scamander. Theseus loved Newt, and attempted to give him useful advice to keep Newt out of political trouble, and patiently put up with the bitterness with which Newt treated him, simply wanting the best for his brother. Theseus is also quite affectionate, with him notably hugging Newt (though the latter was initially uncomfortable with this), and kissing his beloved fiancee [[Leta Lestrange]]. Moreover, Theseus seems to despise violence, since he admitted to Newt that he hated the idea of [[Gunnar Grimmson]] going after [[Credence Barebone|Credence]] for the [[British Ministry of Magic|British Ministry]]. Theseus's nobleness is also shown when he acted calm and quiet while visiting [[Albus Dumbledore]], as opposed to the arrogance and disdain with which with his boss [[Torquil Travers]] carried himself, with Theseus also taking to heart Dumbledore's advice about not showing counter-productive violence against [[Alliance|Gellert Grindelwald's army]] during the [[Paris]] rally. However, Theseus was tragically unable to stop one of his own Auror subordinates from making that mistake at the rally.\n\nAlso, after fellow Auror [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]] tied Theseus up, demanding that he \"control his temper\", Theseus was noble again by not resenting her for that later, understanding Tina's loyalty to Newt. Overall, Theseus lived up to his brave reputation, and had an incorruptible moral code, as he was able to resist [[Gellert Grindelwald]]'s persuasive speech, and even had the bravery to subsequently duel Grindelwald, despite knowing that he was no match for the fearsome [[Dark Wizard]]. Theseus also dearly loved his late fianc\u00e9e [[Leta Lestrange]], not caring about her negative reputation, and her selfless death devastated Theseus, but left him more determined than ever to help stop Grindelwald and end the [[global wizarding war]], so he readily frees Dumbledore of the latter's [[Admonitor]]s.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Magic]]al mastery''': Theseus Scamander was described as \"very powerful\", and, as a [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] student, he excelled in his studies enough to meet the qualifications for [[Auror training]], becoming an Auror, and eventually getting promoted to the position of Head Auror. While Theseus alone was admittedly no match for the extraordinarily powerful [[Gellert Grindelwald]], who was possibly the most powerful Dark Wizard to ever live, [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] Head [[Torquil Travers]] trusted the combined might of Theseus and the latter's subordinate Aurors with the task of bringing Grindelwald in after [[Albus Dumbledore]] refused to, with even Dumbledore seemingly believing that Theseus could survive a fight with Grindelwald if aided by his allies. Indeed, Theseus proved powerful and skilled enough to be able to survive such a fight, alongside Newt and Leta, and was moreover able to aid his brother, future sister-in-law, Yusuf, and [[Nicolas Flamel]] in saving Paris from Grindelwald's black fire.\n*'''[[Auror]] skills''': Theseus Scamander, as the Head Auror, was an exceptionally skilled Auror, more than likely completing the [[Concealment and Disguise]], as well as the [[Stealth and Tracking]] portions of [[Auror training]] with excellence. These skills greatly contributed to Theseus's outstanding performance during the [[First World War]], and to him gaining the respected status of \"war hero\", to the point that [[Hector Podmore]], [[Momolu Wotorson]], [[Rudolph Spielman]], [[Arnold Guzman]] and even the abrasive [[Torquil Travers]] respected him, while [[Gellert Grindelwald]] kept up a correspondence with Theseus while posing as [[Percival Graves]]. During the [[global wizarding war]], Theseus was trusted by the [[British Ministry of Magic]] with the mission to participate in the international wizardhunt for [[Gellert Grindelwald]] (which proved unsuccessful), and later with the international mission to help the [[French Ministry of Magic]] to track down the [[Obscurial]] [[Credence Barebone]], with Theseus's Auror team ultimately succeeding at finding Credence in the [[Lestrange Mausoleum|Lestrange family Mausoleum]]. Theseus was also observant enough to quickly notice his brother [[Newton Scamander|Newt]] and American Auror [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]] infiltrating the French Ministry, despite their efforts to be discreet.\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': As the Head Auror, Theseus was exceptionally skilled in [[martial magic]], surviving magical involvement in the [[First World War]] and being considered a \"war hero\" for his efforts, and later actively participated in the [[global wizarding war]] against [[Gellert Grindelwald]]. Theseus was notably only overpowered by fellow Auror [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]] due to being caught off-guard by her, so he later greatly contributed to stopping Grindelwald's Paris rally, defeating many of Grindelwald's allies. Although Theseus was no match for the incredibly powerful [[Dark Wizard]] alone, while aided by the combined efforts of his brother [[Newton Scamander|Newt]] and girlfriend [[Leta Lestrange|Leta]] as well as future sister-in-law [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina]], he could still stand his ground against Grindelwald for a time.\n*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': As the Head Auror, Theseus would have likely received either an \"[[Outstanding]]\" or \"[[Exceeds Expectations]]\" in his [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] and [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] for this subject.<ref name=\"ootp29\"/> Theseus's skills are evident in his victory in many duels against formidable dark wizards, such as [[Gellert Grindelwald's acolytes|Grindelwald's allies]], and even surviving a brief duel against the incredibly powerful [[Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]] himself, alongside Newt and Leta, being able to hold off Grindelwald's extremely powerful black flames long enough to be saved by Leta, and even pushing the flames back when Grindelwald was not focusing it on him (due to being distracted by Leta). Theseus also was able to easily follow [[Nicolas Flamel]]'s instructions in casting the [[General Counter-Spell]] to contain and extinguish the violent black flames.\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Theseus was shown to be capable with charms, as he was particularly apt in the use of defensive charms and [[counter-spell]]s, as shown by his ability cast a [[Shield Charm]] strong enough to protect himself for a prolonged period of time against Grindelwald's lethal [[Protego Diabolica|black fire]]. He also later proving proficient enough in the [[General Counter-Spell]], as he was able to use it to a large enough scale alongside Nicolas Flamel, Newt, Tina and Yusuf in containing and extinguishing Grindelwald's fire.\n*'''Leadership skills''': Theseus, as the [[Auror Office|Head Auror]] in the [[British Ministry of Magic]], had exceptional leadership skills, with him very effectively commanding a team of no less than 50 Aurors at Grindelwald's rally, and even Albus Dumbledore seemed to respect the Auror's leadership, since he took the time to give the younger man some useful advice. Tragically, however, Theseus was unable to stop one of his Auror subordinates from using the [[Killing Curse]] at the rally.\n*'''Indomitable willpower''': Theseus possessed immense willpower and bravery, being a respected hero of the [[First World War]], and joining in on the subsequent [[global wizarding war]] as the [[Auror|Head Auror]] without hesitation. As such, despite recognising [[Gellert Grindelwald]] as a \"charismatic blighter\", and despite seeing horrifying visions of a future [[Second World War]], Theseus's moral code was incorruptible, and therefore, he resisted Grindelwald's persuasive speech, and continued valiantly fighting to break up the rally, whilst at the same time rejecting [[Torquil Travers|Travers]]' oppressive orders to arrest anyone simply present.\n*'''[[Apparition]]''': Theseus, like most accomplished adult wizards, could Apparate at will.\n\n==Possessions==\n*'''[[Theseus Scamander's wand|Wand]]''': Theseus's [[wand]] had a tortoiseshell handle, to represent his elegance and for a man who would do rather well for himself in his future. His [[wand wood]], [[Wand core|core]] and length were all unknown.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Newt Scamander===\n[[File:Ministry family.jpeg|200px|thumb|Theseus Scamander with his brother Newt Scamander and Fiancee Leta Lestrange]]\nWhile not very impressed with his brother's career, it would still appear that they got along reasonably well, given the light-hearted tone of the letter he sent his brother. Even so, he still had certain high expectations of his brother, demanding that Newt pick a side in the war against Grindelwald when the news reached them that the dark wizard had escaped MACUSA custody, and resumed his rise to dominance over the wizarding world. Even though Newt is distant and bitter towards Theseus, due to his older brother's engagement to his ex-girlfriend [[Leta Lestrange]], Theseus harbours no ill will towards his brother, and has a tendency to hug Newt, much to Newt's discomfort. However, after Leta sacrifices her life to save the both of them, a devastated Newt is the one to initiate a hug with Theseus, mending their relationship, and assuring his brother that he has finally chosen a side in the [[global wizarding war]].\n\n===Leta Lestrange===\n[[File:Leta with Theseus.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Theseus Scamander with his fiancee Leta Lestrange]]\nWhile it is unknown what kind of relationship they might have had during their younger years, if any, Theseus and Leta would eventually get better acquainted at the [[Ministry of Magic]], where he worked as the Head Auror, and she as the assistant to the Head of [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement|Magical Law Enforcement]], [[Torquil Travers]], resulting in the gradual burgeoning of a mutual love between them, and an engagement. Leta's death left Theseus absolutely devastated, and he readily agreed to free [[Albus Dumbledore]] of the [[Admonitor]]s, so that the professor could more actively help in the war against Grindelwald.\n\n===Torquil Travers===\n[[File:Torquil Travers.png|140px|thumb|right|Torcquil Travers, his boss]]\nDespite Theseus' boss Travers usually being an arrogant and abrasive, he respected Theseus enough to promote him to the position of Head Auror following the [[First World War]], and trusted Theseus and the latter's Auror subordinates with the extremely dangerous mission of going after Grindelwald in Paris, in cooperation with the [[French Ministry of Magic]].\n\n===Albus Dumbledore===\n[[File:YoungAlbusDumbledore.jpg|140px|thumb|left|Albus Dumbledore, his former professor and friend]]\nDumbledore was Theseus' former professor, and he respected the young Head Auror significantly, giving Theseus some useful advice on how to act while infiltrating Grindelwald's Paris rally. Theseus reciprocated the respect, as he took Dumbledore's advice to heart, and later returned to Hogwarts to free his former professor from Ministry [[Admonitor]]s.\n\n==Etymology==\n*''Theseus'' (\u0398\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2) was the mythical king of Athens who is most known as having undergone the Labyrinth where he slew the Minotaur. Like his mythological namesake, he laboured for the common good and won wide renown (as both an Auror and a war hero), battling against moral evil (comparable to the monsters of mythological renown).\n*Though it may seem Newt's brother Theseus has no connection with beasts on the outside, according to {{w|Hippolytus (play)|Euripides}}, Hippolytus (mythological Theseus's son with Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons) was a loyal follower of the goddess {{wplink|Artemis}}, who besides being more known as the goddess of the hunt, also functions (among other things) as \"mistress of the animals\" (in her capacity of her title as \"''Potnia Theron''\") & \"nurse of youths\" (epithet \"''Kourotrophos''\"); \"Artemis\" being one of Newt's middle names. Alternatively, Theseus's connection to beasts may be more direct. While Newt, nicknamed for a creature, seeks to protect animals, Theseus, with the name of a man who killed such a creature, the Minotaur, may have an opposing perspective.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Theseus is portrayed by [[Callum Turner]] in {{COG}}.\n*Callum Turner is actually younger than [[Eddie Redmayne]], who plays [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], despite being his older brother in-universe.\n*An unknown actor voiced Theseus Scamander reading his letter in the opening of the {{FB|FHF}} level pack for {{LEGO|D}}.\n*In a interview posted to YouTube by SnitchSeeker.com on 25 September 2018, Callum Turner stated that Theseus is in Hufflepuff house.<ref name=\"SnitchSeeker\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Theseus Scamander}}\n*{{FB|S}} {{1st Mention}}\n*{{FB|F}} {{Mention}}\n*{{COG|S}} {{1st}}\n*{{COG}}\n*{{SOD}}<ref>https://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/fantastic-beasts-3-begins-filming-in-6-weeks-confirms-theseus-actor-callum-turner-113904/</ref>\n*{{LEGO|D}} {{Voice}}\n*{{AM}}\n*{{PM}}\n*{{WW}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Scamander, Theseus}}\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=Unknown\n|position=Head of the [[Auror]] [[Auror Office|Office]]\n|years= c.
