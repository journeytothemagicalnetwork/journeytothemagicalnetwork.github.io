He is seen again in the Main Hall studying as [[Seamus Finnigan|Seamus]] told everyone that [[Sirius Black]] was sighted at an area close to Hogwarts. He agreed with Seamus that Sirius can get passed the Dementors and believed that he would do it again.\n\n===Fifth year===\n[[File:DA Clapping.png|250px|thumb|right|Bem in front of [[Fred and George Weasley]] in the [[Room of Requirement]]]]\nIn his [[fifth year]] (the [[1995\u20131996 school year]]), Bem became a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], in order to learn practical defensive magic from [[Harry Potter]] and to rebel against the tyrannical and incompetent [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[professor]] [[Dolores Umbridge]].<ref name=\"OOTPF\">{{OOTP|F}}</ref>\n\n==Physical appearance==\nHe was a black boy with dark eyes and a round face. He was also slightly overweight with a lisp.<ref name=\"poafilm\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Bem means \"peace\" in the language of the [[Wikipedia:Tiv|Tiv]], of [[Wikipedia:Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[Wikipedia:Cameroon|Cameroon]] and also means \"good\" or \"well\" in Portuguese.<ref>''The New Age Baby Name Book'' by Sue Browder</ref> \"BEM\" is also an abbreviation for ''British Empire Medal'', a medal received from British royalty for meritorious civil or military service, which reflects Bem being [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into Gryffindor.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Like the character [[Nigel Wolpert]], Bem is not mentioned in the [[Harry Potter (book series)|books]], but is credited in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]]. Played by [[Ekow Quartey]],<ref name=\"actor\">[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1600606/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t46/ Ekow Quartey - IMDB]</ref> the character is listed in the credits for ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' as simply \"Boy 1\". However, on the ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' DVD, the [[Wikipedia:Closed captioning|closed captions]] identify the character as \"Bem\" during the Divination class scene.\n*Bem cannot be considered [[canon]], as the books identify in several places that there are only five [[Gryffindor]] boys in Harry's year: [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley]], [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Seamus Finnigan]] and [[Dean Thomas]].\n*Bem also makes an appearance as a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]''. His house was changed to [[Ravenclaw]], probably to correct their mistake of putting him in Gryffindor last time. He appears in the credits as \"Ravenclaw boy\".\n\n==See also==\n*[[Nigel Wolpert]]\n*[[Igor Karkaroff's aide]]\n*[[Kellah]]\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Bem}}\n*{{POA|F}} {{1st}} {{Non-canon}}\n*{{OOTP|F}} {{Non-canon}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[de:Bem]]\n[[es:Bem]]\n[[fr:Bem]]\n[[pl:Bem]]\n[[ru:\u0411\u0435\u043c]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Dumbledore's Army]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
