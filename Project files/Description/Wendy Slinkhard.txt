M. Barrie's play ''Peter Pan'' (1904), the name \"Wendy\" was created from the nickname fwendy \"friend\", given to the author by a young friend. However, the name was used prior to the play (rarely), in which case it could be related to the Welsh name Gwendolen and other names beginning with the element gwen meaning \"white, fair, blessed\".\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{HBP|F}} {{Photograph}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Slinkhard, Wendy}}\n\n[[de:Wendy Slinkhard]]\n[[pl:Wendy Slinkhard]]\n[[Category:Authors]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n\n[[Category:Slinkhard family|Wendy]]\n[[Category:Slug Club]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
