He often helped them work on their inventions and tricks, some of which were eventually sold at [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]]. Lee also served as a [[Quidditch Commentator]] during his Hogwarts years and was a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation taught and led by [[Harry Potter]].<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\nAfter Hogwarts, he hosted a radio show, ''[[Potterwatch]]'', in order to inform and encourage the wizarding world, advising how they could all be protected from [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]].

When he arrived at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] during the [[sorting ceremony]], he was Sorted into the house of [[Gryffindor]], where he would share a dormitory with other Gryffindor boys, [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]], who would become his best friends. Also Sorted in the same house and year as him was [[Angelina Johnson]]. Lee Jordan became the Quidditch commentator, but he was always closely supervised in his job by his head of house, [[Minerva McGonagall]], as his commentary was always biased in favour of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. He was, however, fair to the houses of [[Ravenclaw]] and [[Hufflepuff]] when they were playing, but in the case of [[Slytherin]] he would be highly critical and rude at times.<ref name=\"PS\"/>\n\n====Third year====\n{{Quote|Listen, we're going down the middle of the train \u2014 Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula down there.|[[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] talking about Lee's tarantula|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}\n\n[[File:Students10 feast.PNG|250px|thumb|Lee sitting next to Percy Weasley during the 1991 Welcoming Feast]]\n\nIn [[1991]], Lee Jordan was going into his [[third year]] of education at Hogwarts, and on [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters|Platform 9\u00be]] he was surrounded by a large group of students, all peering into his box containing a [[Lee Jordan's tarantula|tarantula]] . His friends Fred and George thought nothing of it until it became a giant tarantula with the possible aid of an [[Engorgement Charm|engorging charm]] and they had to rush and see. Lee was a popular troublemaker and so were his best friends. On the evening [[Harry Potter]] was made [[Seeker]] for the Gryffindor Quidditch Team, Fred and George told Harry that they could not stay long as Lee Jordan thought he had discovered a new secret passage out of the school grounds and they wanted to check it out with him.<ref name=\"PS\">{{PS}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|Slytherin in possession, [[Chaser]] [[Adrian Pucey|Pucey]] ducks two [[Bludger]]s, two Weasleys, and Chaser [[Katie Bell|Bell]], and speeds toward the \u2014 wait a moment \u2014 was that the Snitch?|Lee Jordan's enthusiasm as a Quidditch commentator|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}\n[[File:Harry-potter1-lee_minerva.jpg|245px|thumb|left|Lee Jordan sitting with McGonagall during a game]]\nLater on in the year, when Gryffindor played its first Quidditch match of the season against Slytherin, Lee Jordan commentated. His commentary was heavily biased in favour of Gryffindor. He identified the [[Chaser]]s on each team, and when he spoke of Angelina Johnson, he went on to tell the whole crowd that he was disappointed with her for not wanting to go out with him. Later in the game when the Snitch was first visible, Harry Potter was fouled by Slytherin's [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] and [[Chaser]] [[Marcus Flint]] and Lee was quick to speak the truth and told the audience that it was a deliberate foul. Professor McGonagall had to call Lee into order and he finally stopped his ranting.

In [[1992]], Harry's second year, the [[Slytherin]] team had a new seeker, [[Draco Malfoy]], who had bought his way onto the team by having his father, [[Lucius Malfoy]], purchase brooms for the entire team. During the Quidditch match against Slytherin, however, a rogue [[Bludger]] was set on [[Harry Potter]] and the game became surprisingly interesting and extremely dangerous for Harry, other players, and the crowd.

In that match, Lee's commentary was extremely biased in favour of Gryffindor and he even resorted to foul language while criticising the Slytherin team's dirty tactics, which forced Professor McGonagall to try to take away the megaphone from him. Towards the end of the game however, after Slytherin's Seeker [[Draco Malfoy]] stopped Harry from catching the [[Golden Snitch]] by grabbing the end of his Firebolt, McGonagall became just as angry at the Slytherin team and their cheating tactics as Lee was and stopped telling him off for his biased commentary.

After [[Albus Dumbledore]] had announced that the Triwizard Tournament would be held at Hogwarts, Lee discussed ways to avoid the age restriction that was said to be placed around the [[Goblet of Fire]] with his best friends [[Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]]. They were only months away from turning seventeen, which was the minimum age requirement for a champion. They attempted to use an [[Ageing Potion]] to get past the age line.<ref name=\"GOF\">{{GOF}}</ref>\n\nThe day before the champion selection, Fred drank a few drops of it with his twin, and later that day jumped across the age line with the whole hall watching. At first, it appeared to have worked, and George followed him with a triumphant yell, but then there was a sizzling sound. Both of the twins were shot ten feet away on the cold stone floor, now accompanied by long white beards. Lee, who had not jumped across the [[Age Line]] with the twins, laughed heartily at them with the rest of the people in the hall, and accompanied Fred and George to the [[Hospital Wing]] to have their beards removed.<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n\n[[File:Third task onlookers.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Lee and others cheering on Harry Potter]]\n\n[[Harry Potter]], however, was accepted by the Goblet of Fire as a [[Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard]] [[Triwizard Tournament#1994 Triwizard Tournament|champion]] despite his youth and that Hogwarts already had a Triwizard champion in [[Cedric Diggory]] of [[Hufflepuff]]. While Harry and Hermione knew that he did not put his name in the Goblet of Fire, the rest of the Gryffindors, including Lee, believed that Harry found a way to get past the age line and hailed him as a hero as a result. Ron also believed that Harry put his name in the Goblet of Fire, but instead of hailing him as a hero, he became jealous of him, thinking that Harry wanted more fame, which led to the two best friends avoiding each other until the first task has been completed. On the first [[Hogsmeade]] weekend trip, Ron went with Lee, Fred, and George instead of Harry and Hermione. On the journey back home after the tournament ended, the twins reveal to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] had cheated Lee's father over repaying a bet made in the [[Quidditch World Cup]].<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n\n====Seventh year====\n{{Quote|Exploding Snap's got nothing to do with Defence Against the Dark Arts, Professor!

This meant trouble for Lee and his friends as they normally enjoyed pulling pranks at the expense of people such as [[Argus Filch]].  However, they couldn't do so this year with her watching. When it was time for action to be put into place, [[Hermione Granger]] came up with idea of an organisation against Umbridge, [[Dumbledore's Army]]. Lee willingly became a member of the organisation along with Fred and George. When he, George, and Fred arrived for the first meeting of the organisation at the [[Hog's Head]] they were all seen carrying large bags of merchandise from [[Zonko's Joke Shop]].<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\n[[File:Leejordanda.PNG|240px|thumb|left|Lee Jordan in the [[Room of Requirement]]]]\n\nLater on in the year, [[Minerva McGonagall]] told off Lee for his commentary again when he became extremely complimentary towards Gryffindor captain [[Angelina Johnson]] in the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin, and yet again complained about her not going out with him. He was also one of the students who were enthusiastic over [[Keeper of Keys and Grounds|Hogwarts gamekeeper]] and [[Care of Magical Creatures]] teacher [[Rubeus Hagrid]] returning to the school after his [[Mission to the Giant colony|Order mission]], and rushed to the staff table along with Fred and George to shake his hand.<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\nShortly after the mass outbreak from [[Azkaban]], teachers were forbidden from discussing anything unrelated to academics with their students as per the ''Educational Decree Number 27 ''passed by the Ministry of Magic. Lee took this new rule as an opportunity to deny Umbridge and correctly reminded her that she had no business in arguing with Fred and George over playing [[Exploding Snap]] in the back of her class as it was a non-academic subject. However, she did not see it that way and he was made to serve detention using a [[Black Quill|Blood Quill]] to write lines. After having served detention [[Harry Potter]] suggested using [[Murtlap Essence|Essence of Murtlap]] to heal the wounds on his hand.<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\nHe felt dispirited when Fred and George [[Fred and George Weasley's departure from Hogwarts|escaped from Hogwarts]]. This had an adverse effect on his Quidditch commentary, as witnessed in the final match of the season between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw, where he commentated without any enthusiasm. However he did swear very badly when Ravenclaw captain [[Roger Davies]] scored the first goal of the match. He took over the twins' rebellion against Umbridge, and harassed her by levitating [[Niffler]]s in through her window. This turned out to cause more harm than help \u2014 Umbridge thought that Hagrid was doing it, and added to her reasoning to sack him.<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\n===After Hogwarts {{C|1996-1998}}===\n{{Quote|Listeners, I\u2019d like to invite you now to join us in a second's silence in memory of [[Edward Tonks|Ted Tonks]], [[Dirk Cresswell]], [[Bathilda Bagshot]], [[Gornuk]], and the unnamed, but no less regretted, [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s murdered by the [[Death Eaters]].|Lee Jordan in a wartime broadcast of ''[[Potterwatch]]''|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\n\n[[File:Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour.jpg|250px|thumb|The wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour that Lee attended]]\n\nOn [[1 August]], [[1997]], Lee attended the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] of [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], Fred and George's older brother, to [[Fleur Delacour]].

Lee was possibly saddened when he learned about his death.<ref name=\"DH\"/>\n\nLee also appeared to have the same point of view with [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], who believed that every human life is worth the same, and worth saving. Lee responded by expressing his opinion that Kingsley was right, and that he would vote him as a [[Minister for Magic]].<ref name=\"DH\"/> After the war, Kingsley eventually became Minister for Magic.\n\n===Dumbledore's Army===\n{{Quote|Well, once a week sounds cool.|Lee's interest in Dumbledore's Army meetings|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n[[File:Dumbledore%27s_Army.jpg|225px|thumb|left|Dumbledore's Army]]\nLee became a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]] in [[1995]], in order to learn [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] from [[Harry Potter]] and oppose [[Dolores Umbridge]]. Lee was friendly with the most members of the Army. Some of his closest friends appeared to be [[Fred and George Weasley]], [[Alicia Spinnet]], [[Katie Bell]], [[Oliver Wood]] (who wasn't an official member of the army, but supported them and fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] alongside them), [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]]. All of them seemed to like Lee and have fun with him. Other friends of Lee may have been fellow Gryffindors [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Dean Thomas]], [[Seamus Finnigan]], [[Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown,]] and [[Parvati Patil]], as well as Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, such as [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], [[Susan Bones]], [[Hannah Abbott]], [[Michael Corner]], [[Luna Lovegood]], [[Cho Chang]], [[Terry Boot]], [[Anthony Goldstein]], [[Marietta Edgecombe]], and [[Zacharias Smith]]. As Lee was rather friendly with most people, he had a good relationship with them, except for Smith, whom with he, Fred and George argued about Voldemort's return.<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe Jordan is a river in Southwest Asia flowing to the Dead Sea; the river serves as the eastern border of Israel. Similarly, there are several rivers throughout the world named \"Lee,\" including rivers in England, Ireland, and Canada. Thus, when on ''Potterwatch'' Lee's code name is \"River,\" the name is very appropriate. Lee can also refer to the \"lee side\" of a ship, which would be the side protected from the wind (or downwind). Lee can also mean a field or meadow. Jordan can also mean to \"flow\" or \"descend.\" Jordan is also old English for a chamber pot (a small container in the bedroom, used for going to the bathroom, before indoor plumbing).\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Lee Jordan LEGO.png|thumb|Lee Jordan in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]\n*In the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]], Lee Jordan is played by [[Luke Youngblood]], who also provided the voice for Lee in the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{OOTP}}.\n*In the film adaption of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix there was an unnamed black Gryffindor boy who resembles [[Lee Jordan]]. However he doesn't have Dreadlocks and he may be Dean Thomas's Stunt double.\n*In {{DH|F1}}, only one (unnamed) person, probably Lee Jordan, is heard hosting ''[[Potterwatch]]''.\n*In {{DH|F2}}, [[Nigel Wolpert]] contacts the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. He addresses the person he is speaking to as \"River\".\n*In the Harry Potter games, Lee Jordan always starts his commentary by reminding the player of the basics of [[Quidditch]], and what needs to be done to win the challenge.\n*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, Lee Jordan does not sport dreadlocks.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Lee Jordan}}\n[[File:Lee_Jordan_WU.png|130px|thumb|Lee Jordan as seen in {{WU}}]]\n*{{PS}} {{1st}}\n*{{PS|F}}\n*{{PS|G}}\n*{{COS}}\n*{{COS|F}}\n*{{COS|G}}\n*{{POA}}\n*{{GOF}}\n*{{OOTP}} \n*{{OOTP|F}} {{C|Name appears on [[Dumbledore's Army parchment|parchment]]}}\n*{{OOTP|G}}\n*{{HBP}} {{Mention}}\n*{{DH}}\n*{{DH|F1}} {{Comment|Possible appearance}}\n*{{PM}}\n*{{WW}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}}\n*{{QWC}}\n*{{TCG}}\n*{{WU}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jordan, Lee}}\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=[[Murphy McNully]]\n|position=Hogwarts Quidditch Commentator\n|years=?-[[1995]]\n|successor=[[Zacharias Smith]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n{{Dumbledore's Army}}\n{{Order of the Phoenix}}\n[[de:Lee Jordan]]\n[[de2:Lee Jordan]]\n[[es:Lee Jordan]]\n[[fr:Lee Jordan]]\n[[it:Lee Jordan]]\n[[pl:Lee Jordan]]\n[[ru:\u041b\u0438 \u0414\u0436\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043d]]\n[[fi:Lee Jordan]]\n[[nl:Leo Jordaan]]\n[[ja:\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3]]\n[[Category:1970s births]]\n[[Category:Battle of Hogwarts participants]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Broadcasters]]\n[[Category:Dumbledore's Army]]\n[[Category:Foundables]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Jordan family]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Potterwatch]]\n[[Category:Quidditch commentators]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1989]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
