She was in the same year as [[Harry Potter]].\n\n==Biography==\nShe was the witch who [[Neville Longbottom]] had to give the [[Sorting Hat]] back to when he accidentally ran off with it after being sorted.<ref name=\"PS7\">{{PS|B|7}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*As [[Isobel MacDougal]] never appears in the [[Harry Potter (book series)|''Harry Potter'' novels]], it is possible that she is the same character as Morag, having been renamed at some point without [[J. K. Rowling]] noting the change on her handwritten list of the forty original students in [[Harry Potter|Harry's]] year.\n*A student named [[Morag]] appeared in the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (PC, Mac)|PC version]] of [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' (video game)]]. She worked with matches in [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]'s [[Transfiguration (class)|transfiguration class]]. It is possible that this is Morag MacDougal, who may have repeated her first year. ([[Match to needle spell|Match to needle]] is a spell known to be covered in first year transfiguration classes.)\n\n==Etymology==\nMorag is from Gaelic m\u00f3r, \"tall.\" Dougall is from the Gaelic Dubhgall, or \"dark stranger,\" and \"Mac\" is \"son of.\"\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{PS}} {{1st}}\n*{{HPM}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[de:Morag McDougal]]\n[[es:Morag MacDougal]]\n[[fr:Morag MacDougal]]\n[[it:Morag MacDougal]]\n[[pl:Morag MacDougal]][[ru:\u041c\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0433 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0414\u0443\u0433\u0430\u043b]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:MacDougal, Morag}}\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:MacDougal family|Morag]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1991]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
