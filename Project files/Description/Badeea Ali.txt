A creatively ingenious [[soul]], she took an instant interest in the [[portrait]]s that hung all throughout the castle from the moment she set foot in the castle and proceeded to spend most of her time outside of her lessons experimenting with the creation of [[magic]]al paintings of people and places, and the necessary [[spell]]work required to make them come to life.\n\n==Biography==\nBadeea was born in [[1972]] or [[1973]]. Her [[Badeea Ali's mother|mother]] was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] engineer, making Badeea either [[Muggle-born]] or [[half-blood]].\n\nShe owned a pet [[cat]] called [[Laith]]. She loved painting the cat and said she could never have enough cat portraits.<ref>{{HM|5|1|d}}</ref> She also enjoyed experimenting to create new [[Defensive Charm|defensive spells]].\n\nShe may have been Muslim, given that she wore a [[wikipedia:hijab|hijab]], a head covering traditionally worn by women of the [[Islam]]ic faith, along with her Arabic name (as most Muslims have them).\n\n===Hogwarts years {{C|1984-1991}}===\nBadeea started attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] on [[1 September]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw]] house. Due to being a female Ravenclaw of the same year, she may have shared a [[Ravenclaw Girls' Dormitory|dorm room]] with [[Tulip Karasu]].\n\nShe spent her afternoons in the [[Clock Tower Courtyard]], where she created magical portraits. She did not pay attention to the events going on at Hogwarts.<ref>{{HM|5|4}}</ref>\n\nShe successfully convinced another student, [[Jae Kim]], that she was able to [[Apparition|apparate]], but in reality she used an [[invisibility cloak]].<ref>{{HM|5|20}}</ref>\n\nIn her second year, during the [[Teacher Appreciation Celebration]], Badeea wondered why there wasn't a Student Appreciation Celebration.<ref>{{HM|2|A SPECIAL CELEBRATION OF HOGWARTS TEACHERS!}}</ref>\n\nIn her third year, Badeea took [[Divination (class)|Divination]]<ref>{{HM|6|2}}</ref> and the [[Muggle Studies]]<ref>{{HM|7|3}}</ref> as an elective.\n\n====Fifth year====\nIn the [[1988\u20131989 school year]], she had [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] and [[History of Magic]]<ref>{{HM|5|3|hm}}</ref> classes with, among others, [[Jacob's sibling]].\n\nShe and Jacob's sibling met in the Clock Tower Courtyard when Badeea Ali was creating a magical portrait of [[Hogsmeade]]. Jacob's sibling needed her help to rescue [[Beatrice Haywood]], who was stuck in a painting, after [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] had told them about Badeea. Badeea explained that she had been attempting to recreate the portrait with Beatrice. She advised them to try something they would never normally do find a solution; taking this to heart, Jacob's sibling put on a cheery, complimentary attitude towards [[Pitts]] in detention, [[Argus Filch]], and [[Merula Snyde]], and obtained surprising results.\n\nLater on, Jacob's sibling met up with Badeea in Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom when the former was looking for [[Patricia Rakepick]]. Jacob's sibling asked Badeea to teach them one ability.\n\nBadeea and Jacob's sibling later invented the [[Star Shower Spell]] as part of the latter's chaos event in an attempt to get the [[Vault Portrait]] from [[Peeves]].\n\n====Sixth year====\nSometime during the year, Badeea became a founding member of the [[Circle of Khanna]], a group devoted to avenging [[Rowan Khanna]] and locating the final [[Cursed Vaults|cursed vault]]. It was at the groups first meeting in the [[Hog's Head Inn]] that she learned of the malevolent organisation \"[[R]]\" and it's [[Plot to find the Cursed Vaults|motives]] to locate the final Cursed Vault before them. As their first task, Badeea and [[Talbott Winger|Talbott]] made a [[Map of the Great Lake]].<ref name=\"hm20\"/>\n\n==Physical appearance==\nBadeea had brown eyes and pale skin, and wore a blue sparkled hijab.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nBeing a member of [[Ravenclaw]] house, Badeea was a highly intelligent and creative young witch with an impressive talent for painting and the experimentation with new forms of [[magic]] and [[spell]]s. She was academically-minded, who took great interest in her schoolwork and thus often enjoyed discussing academic topics with other students. She was also friendly and good-natured, as she was willing to assist [[Jacob's sibling]] when they needed her help. Indeed, she was so devoted to her hobby as an artist that she did not pay much attention to many of the events that went on at Hogwarts, showing her to be a fiercely dedicated individualist who preferred living in her own imagination and world, rather than being too obsessed with reality. She feared anything with which she could not interact through reason, which included birds.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Spell creation]]''': Badeea invented the [[Star Shower Spell]] with the help from [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Severus Snape]], along with the [[jinx]] ''[[Flipendo Maxima]]'', a highly powerful version of the [[Knockback Jinx]], both whilst she attended Hogwarts. These were incredibly impressive achievements for a Hogwarts student, given how the art of spell creation is both highly complex and even dangerous, showing her to have been a highly accomplished and inventive witch in this respect.\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Badeea was proficient in charm-work, as she successfully created the [[Star Shower Spell]], an [[Atmospheric Charm]] and was able to place the necessary charms on the [[portrait]]s she painted to give them personality. She also enjoyed experimenting with new [[Defensive Charm]]s in her free time.\n*'''[[Astronomy (class)|Astronomy]]''': Badeea was skilled in astronomy given how she had earned a [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] in the subject at Hogwarts, allowing her to study it at [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] level.<ref name=\"HM625a\">{{HM|6|25|a}}</ref>\n*'''[[Divination]]''': Badeea was skilled in the art of divination, given how she had earned a [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] in the [[Divination (class)|subject]] at Hogwarts, allowing her to study it at [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] level.<ref name=\"HM62d\">{{HM|6|2|d}}</ref>\n*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Badeea was skilled in transfiguration given how she had earned a [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] in the [[Transfiguration (class)|subject]] at Hogwarts, allowing her to study it at [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] level.<ref name=\"HM643t\">{{HM|6|43|t}}</ref>\n*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Badeea was skilled in this Defence against the Dark Arts given how she had earned a [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] in the subject at Hogwarts, allowing her to study it at [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] level.\n*'''Artistic skills''': Badeea was a highly talented and imaginative artist, who specialised in the creation of [[magic]]al, living [[portrait]]s, due to her own personal fascination with such magical items.\n*'''[[Muggle Studies]]''': Badea earned an O.W.L. in Muggle Studies and continued the subject at N.E.W.T. level.<ref name=\"HM73\">{{HM|7|3}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|'''Badeea Ali''' is an incredibly creative Ravenclaw who's constantly pushing the limits of art and magic. Her unorthodox approach helps her invent new spells, and helps you solve seemingly impossible problems.|Character Info|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n*Based on her name, it is possible that she was of Arabic descent. Her wearing of a hijab further supports the idea that she is of Arabic Muslim background. However, even non-Arab Muslims usually have names with these roots (i.e. ones from Africa or Pakistan; more common in the UK and Ireland).\n**Her being of Islamic background does not seem to have caused any complications for her, despite the religion traditionally having a strongly hostile attitude towards the practising of any kind of magic. However, it is possible that her family do not practice Islam very strictly, have found a way to reconcile their faith with it or simply have excused her case, as preventing Badeea from mastering her magic or forcing her to suppress it could result in her becoming an [[Obscurial]].\n===Friend Interaction correct answers===\n\n====Meal with a Friend====\n*\u2714+ [[Ingolfr the Iambic]]\n*\u2714+ [[Godric's Hollow]] at Night/Witch and Wizard Couple\n*\u2714+ [[Mopsy Fleabert]]\n*\u2714+ [[Malecrit]]\n*\u2714+ [[The Hobgoblins]]\n*\u2714+ [[The Bent-Winged Snitches]]\n*\u2714+ [[Walter Crane]]\n*\u2714+ [[Magenta Comstock]]\n\n====Playing Gobstones====\n*\u2714+ I might fall asleep\n*\u2714 I might die of boredom\n*\u2714+ Let's discuss [[History of Magic]]\n*\u2714 Let's discuss [[Arithmancy]]\n*\u2714+ I'll ask [[Cuthbert Binns|Binns]] to come lecture\n*\u2714 I'll sing you a lullaby\n*\u2714+ Sorry, I was nodding\n*\u2714 It was quite boring\n*\u2714 Let's think boring thoughts\n*\u2714+ Let's stare at the ground\n*\u2714 I prefer taking a kip\n*\u2714+ I don't have an opinion\n\n====Drink Butterbeer====\n*\u2714+ Ali\n*\u2714+ [[Professor]] [[Filius Flitwick|Flitwick]]\n*\u2714+ Painting [[Portrait]]s\n*\u2714+ [[Clock Tower Courtyard|Clocktower Courtyard]]\n*\u2714+ [[Beatrice Haywood]]\n*\u2714+ Think outside the box\n*\u2714+ [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly Headless Nick]]\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Badeea Ali}}\n*{{HM}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Ali, Badeea}}\n[[fr:Badeea Ali]]\n[[ru:\u0411\u0430\u0434\u0438\u044f \u0410\u043b\u0438]]\n[[Category:1970s births]]\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Brown-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Circle of Khanna]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws Sorted in 1984]]\n[[Category:Spell inventors]]\n[[Category:Sphinx Club]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
