She presumably was educated at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was Sorted into [[Gryffindor]] house.\n\nIt is unknown when or how she died, but it was by some time in the 1960s at the very latest (since her portrait already guarded the entrance to [[Gryffindor Tower]] by then).\n\n===As a portrait===\n[[File:Fat lady.JPG|250px|thumb|left|The Fat Lady's portrait]]\nAfter the Fat Lady died, a painting depicting her was hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]], guarding the [[Gryffindor Tower|Gryffindor Common Room]]. It is also unknown who or what, if anything, guarded the common room before her. The Fat Lady was a dutiful guardian to the Gryffindor Tower, only granting entrance to those who produce the correct password.<ref name=\"OOTP11\"/> She had, however, been known for reprimanding students when they returned late, annoyed that they woke her up from her sleep.<ref name=\"PS9\"/><ref name=\"GOF31\"/> She had been known to move about occasionally and had a friend, [[Violet]], who visited her, especially during such holidays as Christmas break. The two drank together frequently, once consuming several vats of wine that were in a picture of some drunk monks.<ref name=\"HBP17\"/>\n\n====[[1960s]]====\nWhen [[Molly Weasley|Molly Prewett]] was a student, she returned to Gryffindor Tower at four o'clock in the morning after taking a late night stroll with her then boyfriend (now husband), [[Arthur Weasley]], and they both got a telling-off from the Fat Lady.<ref name=\"GOF31\">{{GOF|B|31}}</ref>\n\n====[[1975]]====\nAfter the end of their friendship, Severus Snape remained outside the Gryffindor Common Room until Lily came out to talk to him.<ref name=\"DH33\">{{DH|B|33}}</ref>\n\n====[[1991\u20131992 school year]]====\n{{Quote|Where on earth have you all been?|The Fat Lady scolding first year Gryffindors for being out late|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}} \nIn [[1991]], the Fat Lady allowed [[first year]] Gryffindors into Gryffindor tower with the correct password.<ref name=\"PS7\">{{PS|B|7}}</ref> When [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley]] had left the dormitory late one night to [[Duelling|duel]] [[Draco Malfoy]] at the third floor, she went off for a nightime visit, therefore meaning they, [[Hermione Granger]] (who had tried to stop them leaving) and [[Neville Longbottom]] (who had forgotten the password), could not enter, resulting in all four of them heading down to the third floor.

She is shown with black hair and a pink silk dress and she doesn't seem to have much personality. Oddly, this version of her is not particularly fat. Her portrait is located at the end of a corridor somewhere in the [[Hogwarts Castle|castle]], but its location is never specified.\n**The Fat Lady as portrayed by Spriggs moves only when approached by a student and very little at that. She also asks for the password, ensuring more effective concealment of the common room. In the first film, given the Fat Lady's dress and background, she seems to have lived in the sixteenth century Europe.\n**The Spriggs version of the Fat Lady's portrait is also used in the video game adaptations of ''Philosopher's Stone'' and ''Chamber of Secrets''.\n*In {{POA|FA}}, she is played by [[Dawn French]], who portrays the character with a more humorous side, such as giving her a bad singing voice (possibly from the saying \"the fat lady sings\"). This iteration of her is larger than the previous one. She is much louder and more flamboyant and would be obvious to any passing members of other houses, who would also be able to hear Gryffindor students as they gave her the password, which this version of the portrait is reluctant to listen to. By this time, her portrait has been moved to the [[Hogwarts Castle|seventh floor]] of the [[Marble Staircase Tower|Grand Staircase Tower]]. The portrait is shown to swing backwards rather than forwards in this film as well. In the third film, given the Fat Lady's dress and background, she seems to have lived during the {{W|Classical antiquity|Classical period}}. When the Gryffindor students aren't impressed with her singing, she mutters \"Plebs\" as they pass her. She also wears a white dress instead of a pink one.\n**The reason why the location of the Fat Lady's portrait was changed in the third film was because the filmmakers opted not to return to Gloucester Cathedral, where the scenes for the Fat Lady in the first film were shot.\n*In {{GOF|FA}}, it is suggested that the Fat Lady's portrait may actually be a hidden passageway or shortcut. This is because the Gryffindor Boys' Dormitory is shown to be located in a small tower at the corner of the [[The Quad|Paved Courtyard]] close to the [[Clock Tower]] and it is presumed the Fat Lady's portrait remains located in the [[Grand Staircase]].\n*In the American versions of the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|''Chamber of Secrets'' video game]], she is instead named '''The Pink Lady'''.\n*In the video game versions of the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|fifth]] and [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|sixth]] films, characters do not give the Fat Lady a password, as she simply opens to admit them upon recognising them.\n*It can also be noted that although the location of the portrait changes in the films, the size and shape of the actual [[Gryffindor Tower|Gryffindor Common Room]] remains the same.\n*The Fat Lady is a playable character in {{LEGO|Y2}}, in which she, despite being opaque and not floating like ghosts, only has [[ghost]]ly abilities (like scaring other characters).\n*In {{HM}}, the entrance to the Gryffindor Common Room appears to be a normal door, though it is possible that it leads to the Fat Lady's corridor.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of the Fat Lady}}\n*{{PS}} {{1st}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{PS|F}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{PS|G}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{COS}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{COS|F}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{COS|G}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{POA}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{POA|F}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{POA|G}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{GOF}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{OOTP}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{OOTP|G}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{HBP}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{DH}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{LEGO|B}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{LEGO|C}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{LEGO}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{WWHP}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{TCG}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{PM}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{WW}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{HM}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{PAS}} {{Portrait}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[de:Fette Dame]]\n[[de2:Fette Dame]]\n[[es:Dama Gorda]]\n[[fr:Grosse Dame]]\n[[it:Signora Grassa]]\n[[ja:\u592a\u3063\u305f\u5a66\u4eba]]\n\n[[nl:Dikke Dame]]\n[[no:Den trinne dame]]\n[[pl:Gruba Dama]]\n[[ru:\u041f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0414\u0430\u043c\u0430]]\n[[uk:\u0413\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u043d\u0456]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts corridor namesakes]]\n[[Category:Portraits]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
