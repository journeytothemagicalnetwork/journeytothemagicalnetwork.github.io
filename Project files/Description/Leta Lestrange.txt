[[1896]] \u2013 early September [[1927]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]]-[[France|French]] [[pure-blood]] [[wizardkind|witch]]<ref name=\"blood\" /> born into the [[Lestrange family]]. From an early age, she was distraught over her unstable family lineage and unintentionally bringing about the [[death]] of an infant, [[Corvus Lestrange (V)|Corvus Lestrange]].\n\nShe attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] between [[1908]] to [[1915]], where she was sorted into [[Slytherin]], and was often the target of bullying.<ref name=\"COG\" /> While at school, she developed a close relationship with [[Newton Scamander]], but the two parted ways when she caused trouble using a [[Jarvey]] and Newt took the blame, leading to his [[Discipline at Hogwarts|expulsion]].\n\nIn her adult life, Leta became determined to turn over a fresh leaf and live as a productive and appreciated member of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]]. Leta had become the fianc\u00e9e of Newt's older brother [[Theseus Scamander|Theseus]] by [[1927]]. In this year, she sacrificed herself for them during a [[Gellert Grindelwald's Paris rally|rally]] held in [[Paris]] by [[Gellert Grindelwald]] by distracting him by destroying his [[Gellert Grindelwald's skull-hookah|skull-hookah]] with a powerful spell. Grindelwald's flames then engulfed Leta, incinerating her. Despite this, Leta's demise inspired Newt to openly go to [[Global wizarding war|war]] against the terrorist that had ended her life.<ref name=\"COG\" />\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Lestrange Manor COG.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Leta, Irma Dugard, and her father in the Lestrange Manor]]\nLeta Lestrange was born at [[Lestrange Manor]] at sometime between [[September]] [[1896]] and [[April]] [[1897]], the only child of [[Corvus Lestrange (IV)|Corvus Lestrange]] IV from his rape of [[Laurena Kama]].<ref name=\"parents\" /> The [[Lestrange family|Lestranges]] were an old [[pure-blood]] family, deemed one of the \"[[Sacred Twenty-Eight]]\" by [[Cantankerus Nott]].<ref name=\"pm-pureblood\">{{WW|pure-blood}}</ref> On her mother's side, Leta is descended from a powerful and wealthy pure-blood family of Senegalese origin.\n\nCorvus had coveted the already happily married Laurena and placed her under the [[Imperius Curse]] to draw her away from her husband and son.\n[[File:Leta with Corvus.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|Leta with her brother Corvus on the ship]]\nSoon after Leta's birth, her mother passed away, and Corvus [[marriage|married]] [[Clarisse Lestrange|Clarisse Tremblay]]. This union produced one child, a son, [[Corvus Lestrange (V)|Corvus]] V.<ref name=\"parents\" /> Clarisse also died soon after the birth. On her mother's side Leta had an older half-brother named Yusuf, but it's unlikely that they had any contact with each other, due to the family feud.\n\nUpon learning that the [[Kama family]] had sworn an [[Unbreakable Vow]] of vengeance upon the one he loved most because of his abduction and rape of their matriarch, Corvus IV sent [[Irma Dugard]], his half-elf family servant, to take Leta and her infant half-brother to America. Bothered by his incessant crying, Leta switched him with [[Credence Barebone|another baby]] in a nearby cabin. When the [[Unidentified ship|ship]] sank, one of the escape boats capsized and her half-brother ostensibly drowned.<ref>{{COG}}</ref> The baby taken by Leta ended up being raised by an [[Mary Lou Barebone|unrelated woman]] in [[New York]].<ref name=\"FB88\">{{FB|S|88}}</ref><ref name=\"FB96\">{{FB|S|96}}</ref>\n\n===Hogwarts years===\n{{Dialogue|Queenie Goldstein|That was a real close friendship you had at school.|Newt Scamander|Yes, well, neither of us really fitted in at school, so we \u2014|Newt and Leta's unusually close relationship|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}\nBefore beginning education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1908]], Leta purchased her [[Leta Lestrange\u2019s wand|first wand]], likely from [[Ollivanders]], and was sorted into [[Slytherin]] on [[1 September]].\n\nLeta was bullied at Hogwarts due to the gossip about her being an unwanted child and the tragic death of her half-brother.\n\n[[File:Newt and Leta caring raven.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Newt and Leta caring for a [[raven]] chick]]\nShe encountered [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] while searching for a place to hide from her pursuers, whom she had used the [[dark charm]] ''[[Oscausi]]'' on in retaliation for their malicious gossip. Newt and Leta developed a remarkably close bond, spending much time together over the holidays caring for an injured baby raven.\n[[File:Young Leta Lestrange and Albus Dumbledore.jpeg|250px|thumb|right|Leta being taught the [[Boggart-Banishing Spell]] by Albus Dumbledore]]\nLeta attended Professor [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s teaching of [[Boggart]]s.

On [[19 March]] [[1927]], Leta alongside Newt, Theseus and [[Bunty]], participated in the book launch of {{FB}} at [[Flourish and Blotts]] in [[Diagon Alley]]. The day after, [[Spellbound (magazine)|Spellbound]] published an edition, erroneously captioning a photograph from the event, leading to a misunderstanding that Leta was Newt's fianc\u00e9e, starting a problem between [[Porpentina Goldstein]] and Newton.\n\n===Ministry employee===\n[[File:Ministry family.jpeg|200px|thumb|left|Leta with Theseus and Newt in the British Ministry of Magic]]\nSix months later, upon Theseus' advice, Leta began working at the [[British Ministry of Magic]] in [[London]], as assistant to the Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]], [[Torquil Travers]].<ref>[https://www.msn.com/en-us/entertainment/celebrity/fantastic-beasts-the-crimes-of-grindelwald-meet-the-new-cast/ss-BBPF6kZ 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' -- Meet the new cast]</ref> \n[[File:Leta talking with Dumbledore.jpg|200px|thumb|Leta talking with Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts]]\nShe was part of a delegation led by Travers, to question Albus Dumbledore regarding rumours of Newt's potential travel to [[Paris]]. Dumbledore found Leta reminiscing about her school days at her old desk, consumed with guilt about her wicked past. Lestrange accused Albus that he was the only one who not considered her bad in her youth and was wrong because of it. Dumbledore's insight into her pain led him to tell her about the loss of his sister, [[Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]], and to advise her to get rid of regret.\n[[File:Theseus kiss with Leta.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|Leta with Theseus in the French Ministry of Magic]]\nDuring a visit in the [[French Ministry of Magic]], Leta told Theseus to promise that he will be careful during [[Gellert Grindelwald's Paris rally|Gellert Grindelwald's rally]]. Theseus told her about the rumour that Credence Barebone could be her long-lost stepbrother, which Leta denied. Scamander agreed with her that her brother was dead, but urged her to check the Lestrange family records to be certain, because documents never lied.\n[[File:Leta finds Newt and Tina .jpg|220x220px|thumb|Leta finds Newt and Tina in the Records Room]]\nDuring search for the family box in the [[French Ministry of Magic Records Room|Records Room]], Leta encountered Newt and Tina, who were searching for the box too. Leta discovered that the box was taken to the [[Lestrange Mausoleum]]. The Records Keeper, [[Melusine]], sent [[Matagot]]s after them because of Newt's entering under false pretences. Newt advised them not to fight the Matagots to keep them docile, but the warning came too late. Leta had already unleashed a spell. When the beasts attacked them, Newt hid himself, Tina and Leta in his [[Newton Scamander's suitcase|suitcase]]. As the matagots reached the suitcase, Newt jumped out of her on [[Zouwu]] and flew straight to the [[Cimeti\u00e8re du P\u00e8re-Lachaise|Pere Lachaise Cemetery]]. \n[[File:COG HQ still Yusuf Tina Leta Newt.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Leta revealing the truth]]\nThey headed to the Lestrange tomb and Leta found the Lestrange box which was taken, but they were not alone. They crossed paths with [[Jacob Kowalski]], [[Yusuf Kama]], [[Credence Barebone]] and [[Nagini]]. Leta stopped her half-brother Yusuf, from fulfilling his Vow under the mistaken impression that Credence was really Corvus Lestrange V. She finally confessed to inadvertently killing Corvus, proving he and Credence were not the same person and that she had no idea who Credence actually was. The conversation was interrupted by the beginning of Grindelwald's rally in the underground chamber.\n\n===Death===\n\n{{Quote|I love you...|Leta expressing her love to [[Newton Scamander|Newt]] or [[Theseus Scamander|Theseus]]|Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay}}\n[[File:Leta Grindelwald.jpg|224x224px|thumb|left|Leta confronting Grindelwald]]\nLeta participated in a meeting of Grindelwald's supporters, during which he talked about his approach to Muggles and presented a vision illustrating the effects of hiding from non-immigration and the coming [[Second World War|World War II]]. Grindelwald, seeing the Aurors under Theseus' command, ordered the assembled deportees and proclaimed his views, which they did. In addition, the wizard created [[Protego Diabolica|a circle of black flames]] around him to divide followers from enemies. Only his true followers could cross the spell, while those under the influence of flames were burned.\n[[File:Grindelwald kills Leta.gif|220x220px|thumb|Leta's death from Grindelwald's hands]]\nAmong those who joined the Dark wizard were [[Credence Barebone]], who, despite Nagini's objection, stated that Grindelwald would help him learn his own identity, as well as [[Queenie Goldstein]], Tina's younger sister, for whom Gellert's speech was so convincing that she was able to believe that thanks to him her biggest dream was: marrying Jacob Kowalski, which made the law of that time impossible. When Grindelwald attacked Newt and Theseus, the two most important men in Leta's life, Leta approached him, seemingly about to join his cause. At the last moment, this was revealed to be a distraction in an effort to give Theseus, Newt, Tina, Jacob, Yusuf and Nagini time to get away. Leta destroyed Grindelwald's [[Gellert Grindelwald's skull-hookah|skull hookah]] with a powerful [[spell]], exploding it and knocking over [[Vinda Rosier]] in the process. Right before being incinerated by the flames, she looked at the Scamander brothers and said \"I love you\", though it is unclear which of them she was speaking to. She told the others to leave before she was engulfed by the flames, which incinerated her.\n\n==Physical appearance==\n[[File:Leta-Lestrange.gif|250px|thumb|Leta's appearance]]\nLeta was described as beautiful.<ref>{{COG|S|18}}</ref> She had intense brown eyes and curly dark-coloured hair.\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|She was a taker.|Leta's self-serving nature|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}[[File:Leta's Boggart.gif|300px|thumb|left|Leta's greatest fear: reliving her brother's death]]\nAccording to Queenie, Leta was a \"taker\" rather than a \"giver\",<ref name=\"FB92\">{{FB|S|92}}</ref> and she did display a selfish streak throughout her youth: Leta swapped her baby half-brother [[Corvus Lestrange (V)|Corvus]] for another infant simply because she couldn't tolerate his crying; at Hogwarts, she allowed Newt to take the blame and be expelled for her own childish mistake. On the other hand, Leta suffered a great deal of tragedy throughout her life, and this had a marked effect on her personality: The death of her mother soon after Leta's birth and loveless upbringing at the hands of her father left Leta damaged and confused; the unintentional role she had played in her infant brother's death left her with feelings of incredible guilt and self-loathing (to the point that her [[Boggart]] was her infant brother's drowning). Leta regarded herself as not only guilty of killing her brother (rather than the unforeseen accident it was), but as evil and a monster. She also felt additional guilt over ruining her best friend's education. Despite all this, Leta maintained a polite and considerate personality. She remained friendly towards Newt, for whom she continued to have feelings, and later got engaged to Newt's older brother, [[Theseus Scamander]]. Newt also continued to care for Leta, and even kept mementos of their time together.<ref name=\"bustle\" />\n\nIn several ways, Leta's personality contradicted the \"evil Slytherin\" stereotype held by many students of the other Houses ([[Gryffindor]]s in particular), and was in stark contrast to her father [[Corvus Lestrange (IV)|Corvus]], as well as later Lestranges such as [[Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus]] and [[Rabastan Lestrange|Rabastan]]. For instance, Leta seemed to put no stock in [[pure-blood supremacy]] beliefs, despite her family being one the the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]]. Much like [[Horace Slughorn]] and [[Andromeda Tonks]], Leta could be said to represent the more \"positive\" aspects of [[Slytherin]], in her case ambition and resourcefulness without any of the usual ruthlessness, elitism, or arrogance associated with members of the house. She also did not consider her Slytherin status as a marker of \"superiority\", as she quickly befriended and grew very close to the [[Hufflepuff]] [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], the two bonding over their shared status as outsiders. While she would sometimes hex other students, she did so out of anger in the face of bullying, rather than any unprovoked malice. She was quite liked by her [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor [[Albus Dumbledore]], but struggled to get along with anyone at Hogwarts, except Newt.\n\nLeta ultimately showed courage and selflessness when she sacrificed her life to save the Scamander brothers from certain death, much like how her fellow Slytherin [[Severus Snape]] would likewise sacrifice his life for a good cause many years later. After hearing her former teacher [[Albus Dumbledore]] confessed his own guilt over not loving his late sister [[Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]] enough, Leta was able to take his advice and confess to what she had done to Corvus, thereby saving [[Credence Barebone]] from [[Yusuf Kama]]'s revenge.\n\nLeta's selfless and heroic death would have a profound impact on Newt, giving him the resolve he needed to at last choose a side in the [[Global wizarding war]], as well as inducing Dumbledore to honour Leta's sacrifice by more actively supporting the resistance against Grindelwald.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n{{Dialogue a-b|Leta Lestrange|Finding me in a classroom? Was I such a bad student?|Albus Dumbledore|On the contrary, you were one of my cleverest.|Albus Dumbledore regarding Leta's abilities|Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay}}\n*'''[[Magic]]al mastery''': Leta Lestrange was a very powerful and talented witch, being recognised by [[Albus Dumbledore]] himself as one of his best students at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], proving herself a very accomplished witch.\n*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Leta was highly proficient in this field, given her ability to confront Grindelwald alongside [[Newton Scamander|Newt]] and [[Theseus Scamander|Theseus]] for a time, saving the Scamander brothers from death at the hands of the fearsome Dark Wizard's black fire, even if at the cost of her own life. [[Albus Dumbledore]], perhaps the greatest master of the field to ever live, considered Leta to be one of his best students in the subject. Indeed, Leta only had trouble [[Boggart-Banishing Spell|repelling]] a [[Boggart]] due to her incredible guilt and self-loathing over the role she played in the death of her brother [[Corvus Lestrange (V)|Corvus]]. \n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Leta was shown to be accomplished with charm-work. In her [[third year]] at Hogwarts, she successfully cast the [[dark charm]] ''[[Oscausi]]'' on a [[Unidentified Gryffindor girl 2 (1910's)|Gryffindor girl]] who was speaking spitefully about her, sealing her mouth shut. She effortlessly located the [[Lestrange family]] records in the [[French Ministry of Magic Records Room]] using [[magic]], along with revolving the cabinets with the ''[[Circumrota]]'' charm to reveal [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] and [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]] followed with the ''[[Reverte]]'' charm to return them to their original position. She also successfully used the [[Summoning Charm]] to summon the [[Lestrange Family Tree (Box)|Lestrange family tree box]] to her in the [[Lestrange Vault]]. In her adult life, she was highly capable in casting the [[Stunning Spell]]; in [[September]], [[1927]], she used the spell in an attempt to stun some vicious [[Matagot]]s in the [[French Ministry of Magic]]. She also shattered [[Gellert Grindelwald's skull-hookah]] with a powerful spell. \n*'''[[Apparition]]''': Being an accomplished adult witch, Leta was able to Apparate at will, as shown when she was able to Apparate to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], along with [[Torquil Travers]], [[Theseus Scamander]], and some other [[Auror]]s.\n*'''Indomitable willpower''': Leta's [[Slytherin]] ambition granted her an immense willpower, with her thus managing to rise up high through the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] despite once failing to fit in at Hogwarts as a student, and with her determination to not be the freak that she was perceived to be by other students, and her own father. At the end of her life, Leta demonstrated her incorruptible spirit and morals by resisting [[Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]]'s persuasive speech, and willingly sacrificing her own life to save her beloved friend [[Newton Scamander|Newt]] and fiance [[Theseus Scamander|Theseus]] from the lethal [[Protego Diabolica|black fire]]. Indeed, it was this incorruptible willpower demonstrated in Leta's final moments that induced Newt, as well as her half-brother [[Yusuf Kama]], to finally join the [[Global wizarding war]] against Grindelwald.\n\n==Etymology==\n*Leta most likely originates from the name Leda, daughter of Aetolian king Thestius, an Aetolian princess who became a Spartan queen in Greek mythology, of which the story of Leda and the Swan is the focus.\n**In the story, Zeus takes the form of a swan and rapes her. Their consummation, on the same night as Leda lay with her husband Tyndareus, resulted in two eggs from which hatched Helen (aka \"Helen of Troy\", said to be the most beautiful woman in the world and an instigator of the Trojan War), Clytemnestra, and Castor and Pollux (who became the constellation Gemini).\n\n*The name Lita is of Latin origin and means \"gladly.\"\n*The word ''leta'' is a variation of the Latin word ''leto'', which means \"to kill\" or \"to slay\".\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|The relationship between Leta and Newt Scamander is a complex relationship, so I think there will be a lot of time for that to grow and develop, which will be fun.|[[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] about her character Leta}} \n\n*Leta Lestrange is portrayed by [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] in {{FB|FHF}} and {{COG}}.\n*A younger Leta is portrayed by [[Ruby Woolfenden]] and [[Thea Lamb]] in {{COG}}.<ref>\"[https://www.pottermore.com/news/open-casting-call-for-young-people-announced-for-fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-sequel Open casting call for young people announced for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them sequel]\" from {{PM}}</ref>\n*According to director [[David Yates]], viewers will learn more about Leta Lestrange and Newt's relationship with her in future movies of the franchise.<ref name=\"bustle\" />\n*Leta may or may not be related to [[Bellatrix Lestrange]].
