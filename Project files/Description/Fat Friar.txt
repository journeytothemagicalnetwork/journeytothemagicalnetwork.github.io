He was a jolly man and very forgiving. He devoted his life to religion and, after his death, returned to the school as the resident ghost of [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Life===\n{{Quote|Hope to see you in Hufflepuff! My old house, you know.|The Fat Friar to the first-years before the [[Sorting ceremony]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}\nThe Friar was born no earlier than [[First millennium A.D.|982]],<ref name=\"birthdate\"/> somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]].<ref name=\"PS7\"/>\n\nAt the age of eleven, the Friar became a student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[Scotland]]. He was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]] and was taught by [[Helga Hufflepuff]] in the magical arts the seven years that followed.<ref name=\"house\"/>\n\nAt some point in his life, he joined the clergy as part of a mendicant religious order, meaning that he spent his life begging in the name of charity. A noble life for a noble man. Apparently, given his physically large appearance, he indulged in the pleasures of food<ref name=\"PS7\"/> and drink.<ref name=\"PSf13\"/>\n\nThe Fat Friar's kindness was to be his undoing. He was executed because senior churchmen grew suspicious of his ability to cure the [[pox]] merely by poking peasants with a stick, and his ill-advised habit of pulling [[rabbit]]s out of the [[communion]] cup.<ref name=\"POT\">{{WW|hogwarts-ghosts}}</ref>\n\n===Post-mortem===\n[[File:Friar Feast.png|250px|thumb|left|The Fat Friar after his death]]\nThe Friar returned from the dead as a [[ghost]], and returned to [[Hogwarts Castle]], where he became the house ghost of his former House, [[Hufflepuff]].<ref name=\"PS7\"/> He has thus far spent the majority of his afterlife within the castle walls along with the other Hogwarts ghosts.\n\nAfter his death, the Fat Friar retained his kind and joyful demeanour. He eagerly welcomed new students to the school and offered assistance whenever needed.\n\n====[[1985\u20131986 school year]]====\nThe Fat Friar participated in planning [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's four-hundred and ninety-third Deathday Party|Sir Nicholas' 493rd deathday party]] when [[Erling]], a friend of his, visited Hogwarts. When he knew that Sir Nicholas and Erling had the same deathday, he suggested eagerly for the two to hold a party together, but it was rejected by Erling. Nevertheless, the Friar guided Erling through a tour in Hogwarts, including the [[Charms Classroom|Charms classroom]] and the [[dungeons]].<ref>{{HM|2|DUELLING DEATHDAY PARTIES|2}}</ref>\n\nDuring their parties, when he saw neither of them was going on well, he gathered them together and asked again for a collective party, which they agreed.

The Fat Friar wanted to give him another chance, but both [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] and the [[Bloody Baron]] decided against it, as it was Peeves and he could not and did not want to change, and therefore did not deserve a second chance.
