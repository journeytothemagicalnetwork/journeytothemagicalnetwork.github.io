[[1985]]) was a [[wizardkind|wizard]] and a researcher for the [[British Ministry of Magic]], where he spent several years as a [[research assistant]] in the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] before becoming an [[Unspeakable]] in the [[Department of Mysteries]]. He was married to [[Penelope Fawley|Penelope Padgett]] and had at least two children, [[Addison Fawley|Addison]] and [[Melody Fawley|Melody]]. In [[2015]], his wife and three of their co-workers went mysteriously missing in London along with a reporter from the [[Daily Prophet]]. Following the Ministry's decision to close the investigation into their disappearance, he resolved to do whatever he could to find his wife. He eventually fell under suspicion for having caused the [[Calamity]].<ref>{{WU}} ([https://youtu.be/0olyYXdh6GA?t=162 see video])</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nGrim Fawley was born somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]] during the mid-[[1980s]]<ref name=\"dob\" /> into the wizarding [[Fawley family]]. The Fawleys were one of the \"[[Sacred Twenty-Eight]]\", a number of families that were judged to be still \"truly pure-blood\" by the anonymous author of the ''[[Pure-Blood Directory]]'' in the [[1930s]].<ref>{{WW|pure-blood}}</ref> His parents, [[Marshall Fawley|Marshall]] and [[Lucretia Fawley]], were loving and took good care of him.<ref name=\":4\">[[Harry Potter: Wizards Unite]] (Chapter 2: Grim Fawley - background - [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-2-grim-fawley-background#urn Fawley Urn]) </ref>\n\nAt the age of eleven, Grim received an [[Hogwarts acceptance letter|acceptance letter]] from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. At some point before he boarded the [[Hogwarts Express]], he travelled to [[Diagon Alley]] to buy school supplies: he was able to recall this in vivid detail even as an adult, suggesting he thought it a very good day.<ref>{{WU}} (Brilliant Event: One Year Later)</ref>\n\n===Hogwarts years {{C|1996-2003}}===\nGrim Fawley started at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] on [[1 September]] [[1996]], and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]].<ref name=\":6\">[[Harry Potter: Wizards Unite]] (Chapter 2: Grim Fawley - background - [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-2-grim-fawley-background#transcript Grim's School Record])</ref> His early years at Hogwarts coincided with the height of the [[Second Wizarding War]]: the end of [[1996\u20131997 school year|his first year]] was marked by the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower|infiltration of the school]] by a group of [[Death Eaters]] and the killing of the [[Headmaster]], [[Albus Dumbledore]]; during his [[1996\u20131997 school year|his second year]], following the [[fall of the Ministry of Magic]], the school headed by [[Severus Snape]], and the students were left largely at the mercy of his sadistic [[Deputy Headmaster|deputies]], Death Eaters [[Amycus Carrow|Amycus]] and [[Alecto Carrow]]. The [[Battle of Hogwarts]], which put an end to the war, broke out at the end of that school year: Grim was evacuated with the rest of the students who were not of age through a secret passage to [[Hogsmeade]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nGrim lost both of his parents to [[Death Eaters]] at some point during his first or second year at Hogwarts; their remains were cremated and their ashes kept in a [[porcelain]] urn that he held onto until adulthood.<ref name=\":4\" /> From that point on, Grim spent the rest of his childhood in the care of orphanages, and rarely spoke about it in later years.<ref name=\":7\">[[Harry Potter: Wizards Unite]] (Chapter 2: Grim Fawley - background - [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-2-grim-fawley-background#suitcase Grim's suitcase])</ref> \n\nGrim returned to Hogwarts to complete his education; in spite of the great personal tragedy, Grim remained an outstanding student and [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] [[Minerva McGonagall]] would later go on to describe him as \"''A [[Hufflepuff]] through and through''\",<ref name=\":6\" /> meaning he embodied all of the qualities that marked his House, such as hard work, dedication and loyalty. With no family to go home to, however, would often stay at the school over the [[Christmas holidays]], and spent many a bittersweet yule-day in [[Hogwarts Castle]] with just the portraits and ghosts for company. Even so, he still visibly retained some of the Christmas spirit, and always made sure a present was waiting under the tree for the often neglected [[Hogwarts Caretaker|caretaker]], [[Argus Filch]], and his cat [[Mrs Norris]].<ref>{{WU}} (Brilliant Event: Hogwarts for the Holidays)</ref>\n\nGrim finished his education in [[2003]] with an impressive academic record, having earned five [[Outstanding]]s and one [[Exceeds Expectations]] on his six [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.s]], and a \"glowing recommendation\" from [[Minerva McGonagall]] herself.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Working for Ministry===\n\n====Early career====\nAn accomplished wizard, Grim Fawley joined the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] following his [[Graduation ceremony|graduation]] from Hogwarts, having been hired by the Ministry's [[Ministry of Magic research wing|research wing]], he was assigned to the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]].<ref name=\":6\" /> Landing a desk job as a [[research assistant]] at the [[Auror Office]], Grim was tasked with compiling and fact-checking evidence for the [[Investigation Department]]; a difficult job, but nevertheless one at which he was rather good.<ref>[[Harry Potter: Wizards Unite]], (Mysteries Chapter 2 - Ministry Record - Grim Fawley: [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-2-ministry-record-grim-fawley#memo1 Grim's Work - Shard 1])<br/>\n</ref> While generally quiet and shy around many of his new peers to begin with, Grim was soon recognised for having both \"a wit about him\",<ref name=\":10\">[[Harry Potter: Wizards Unite]], (Mysteries Chapter 1 - Grim Fawley - Motives - [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-1-grim-fawley-motives#note Grim's Grief])\n</ref> as well as for displaying \"a wicked sense oh humour\" around those he was friendly with,<ref>[[Harry Potter: Wizards Unite]], (Mysteries Chapter 1 - Grim Fawley - Motives - [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-1-grim-fawley-motives#memos1 Ministry Memos - Shard 1])\n</ref> A gifted employee, Grim would go on to work alongside many notable [[Auror]]s over the course of his career, such as [[Battle of Hogwarts]] veteran [[Ronald Weasley]], with whom he was partnered for some time when he first joined the department,<ref name=\":7\" /> and [[Mordecai Berrycloth]]. In time, Grim would go on to get along very well with most of his co-workers, earning the respect and gaining the friendship of many of his fellow Ministry officials.\n\nUltimately recognised for having played an important role in the apprehension and capture of a number of dangerous [[Dark Wizard]]s,<ref>[[Harry Potter: Wizards Unite]], (Mysteries Chapter 2 - Ministry Record - Grim Fawley: [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-2-ministry-record-grim-fawley#memo3 Grim's Work - Shard 3])</ref> he was eventually promoted to [[Head research assistant]].<ref name=\":8\">[[Harry Potter: Wizards Unite]], (Mysteries Chapter 2 - Ministry Record - Grim Fawley: [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-2-ministry-record-grim-fawley#memo5 Grim's Work - Shard 5])</ref> It was in this capacity that Grim found himself in frequent contact with was his future wife, [[Penelope Fawley|Penelope Padgett]]. A highly gifted witch and an efficient employee, she had accomplished much in her work at the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]], which ultimately led no less a person than [[Harry Potter]] himself, the Head of the [[Auror Office]], to offer her a job in his department, which she accepted.<ref>[https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/foundable/penelopes-promotion An Internal Ministry Memo, written by Harry Potter, revealing her promotion.]</ref> As the daughter of two [[Death Eaters|staunch followers]] of Lord Voldemort,<ref>[[Harry Potter: Wizards Unite]]: (Mysteries Chapter 3 - Penelope Fawley - Background - [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-3-penelope-fawley-background#badge Penelope's Prefect Badge])\n</ref> there were those, such as [[Gethsemane Prickle]], that remained suspicious of her, and thought that she might have had ulterior motives for agreeing to the transfer.<ref>[[Harry Potter: Wizards Unite]] (''Mysteries Chapter 3 - Penelope Fawley - Background - ''[https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-3-penelope-fawley-background#warning Gethsemane's Warning])\n</ref> Nevertheless judged to be fully qualified for the job, she impressed her new colleagues by [[Auror training|qualifying]] as a fully-fledged Auror a full year earlier than most of her new colleagues had. Subsequently deemed by [[Harry Potter]] to be one of the best and brightest Aurors in the Ministry's employ,<ref>[[Harry Potter: Wizards Unite]]: (Mysteries Chapter 1 - Grim Fawley - Motives - [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-1-grim-fawley-motives#wand Penelope's Wand])\n</ref> she was eventually put in charge of one of their ongoing investigations, and it was during this instance that Grim and Penelope first began working together.<ref name=\":12\">{{WU}} - Mysteries Chapter 2 - Ministry Record - Grim Fawley</ref>\n\nMore open-minded than many of his associates, however, Grim did not judge Penelope based on the chosen allegiance of her parents; and instead dutifully accepted the task of helping her to work a case she had been put in charge of.<ref name=\":8\" /> Over the course of the investigation, the two of them eventually grew close, with the pair eventually falling in love while solving crimes together. Worried that their superiors would find their newfound infatuation inappropriate and transfer him to another department, however, the couple was very private about their relationship to begin with; until finally Grim admitted the truth during a [[Christmas]] party to a friend and co-worker by the name of [[Constance Pickering]].<ref name=\":9\">[[Harry Potter: Wizards Unite]]: (Mysteries Chapter 2 - Grim Fawley - Background - [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-2-grim-fawley-background#locket Silver Locket])</ref> While the revelation of their workplace romance was later described as \"a bit scandalous\", rather than taking an issue with two colleagues dating, however, the reactions they received from their associates turned out to be one of surprise, as many of them thought the couple to be an odd fit.<ref name=\":9\" /> Now free to continue seeing each other openly, however, Grim and Penelope eventually [[Marriage|married]] one another, their wedding taking place in in West Bromwich in [[June]] of [[2006]].<ref name=\":11\">[[Harry Potter: Wizards Unite]], (Mysteries Chapter 2 - Grim Fawley - Background - [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/foundable/wedding-announcement Wedding Announcement])\n</ref> At some point not too long after, the had a pair of fraternal twins,<ref name=\":11\" /> naming them Melody and Addison.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n====Promotion====\nHaving long grown weary of always being sidelined and having to look in on the adventures of those around him, not to mention with being stuck with a job that was,   whilst described by among others [[Harry Potter]] as being very difficult,<ref>{{WU}} Mysteries Chapter 2 - Ministry Record - Grim Fawley</ref> still far below his level of ability and thus left him increasingly unsatisfied. And despite his own initial beliefs to the contrary, it did not take long for his wife to finally convince him that he was indeed cut out for bigger things.<ref>{{WU}} Chapter 2 - Ministry Record - Grim Fawley</ref>  Around the same time, Grim  got hold of an ancient tome; the content of which no one thus far had been up to the task of elucidating. Not only did Grim succeeded where others had failed, however, but he even made it seem easy; and left several handwritten notes detailing his process tucked into the book. Upon learning this, [[Sage Bragnam]], the [[Head Curator]] of the [[Department of Magical Artefacts]], tried to have him transferred to his department, only to learn that Grim's wife had already successfully persuaded him to try his hand as an [[Unspeakable]] in the [[Department of Mysteries]].<ref name=\":12\" /> Although [[Gareth Greengrass]], a high-ranking researcher of said department whom his wife were friendly with, was initially dumbfounded at the prospect of having Grim as a colleague when Penelope first told him that he was considering to apply for a job there, he quickly warmed up to to the idea when it occurred to him that the man was not only fully qualified, but also undeniably a very accomplished wizard, to the point where Greengrass himself would later remark that Grim had \"''more magical talent in his little finger than most of us do in our whole bodies.''\"<ref name=\":12\" /> \n\nAnd so, when Grim finally applied for the job, Mr. Greengrass was completely on board with it.<ref>[https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/foundable/note-grim A note from Grim to his wife: \u201cI\u2019m going to apply to be an Unspeakable.

While there were some rumours going around that Gareth Greengrass were showing favouritism to Grim because of his friendship with Grim's wife, the effort it took to prove his salt, which included an excellent aptitude for secrecy and considerable amount of magical acumen, Grim's achievement alone. and within a year, even Mr. Sallow had to admit, despite of his previous doubts about his commitment to the role, that Grim has surpassed all expectations during his trial period; which ultimately lead Greengrass to dispatch a [[interdepartmental memo]] announcing Grim's promotion.<ref name=\":13\">{{WU}} (Mysteries, Chapter 2. Grim Fawley - Background)</ref> Following this, Grim Fawley received a new [[Ministry of Magic Identity Card|Ministry Identification Card]], featuring a photograph and credentials listing as an Unspeakable, with clearance for the [[Department of Mysteries]], and a [[Skeleton Key|key]] to access it.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nAround the same time, the department would have a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d<ref>[https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/foundable/unspeakables-expanding An Issue of the Quibbler, its headline reading \u201cThe Unspeakables Expand in Secret!

The headline reads: \u201cFIVE GO MISSING IN LONDON \u2013 INVESTIGATION UNDERWAY.]</ref> Soon after, [[Gareth Greengrass]], a high-ranking official in the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]], assured Grim that he would \u201c''do everything in'' [his] ''power''\" and \"''save no expense''\" to find his wife. Considering one of the missing individuals were one of his own subordinates, Harry Potter, was in charge of the investigation. Despite their best efforts, however, the Aurors met a dead end in the London Five investigation,<ref>[https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/foundable/daily-prophet-clipping Daily Prophet clipping informing readers of the closure of the case.]</ref> and thus, the council on which Gareth Greengrass and his colleagues presided over the investigation decided to close the case, leaving the families of the missing distraught. Worse still, part of the reason given for the decision was that the costs of the investigation exceeded the amount that the [[Auror]]s could afford to spend.\n\nSoon thereafter, Grim sent a memo to Greengrass, pleading with him to convince the council to re-open the investigation. To make matters worse, not only had Greengrass deemed it to dismiss it as a bad job, he also implied that he was convinced that Penelope was most likely dead, throwing Grim further into a state of despair. Although Greengrass advised him to take time off work \"to grieve and look after his children\", having gone so far as to even admit that he had already gone over Grim's head and proposed it to Grim\u2019s superiors behind his back, Mr Fawely refused to take the alleged demise of his beloved Nel on face value and resolved to take matters into his own hands<ref name=\":0\">[https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/foundable/grims-grief Part of Grim\u2019s journal, stating that he was \u201cgoing to bring you home, Nel.

Soon thereafter, he tried to retrieve his wife's file in order to learn exactly what she had been doing at the time of her disappearance, only to be denied access to it due to the confidentiality of much of its information. This lead him to write an angry message to Mr Potter, insisting that he had a right to access to it, accusing him of showing blatant disregard for his own subordinates and tried to make him change his mind by claiming that he was actively \"''barring a grieving husband from the closure he deserves\"'', implying he was pretending to have accepted Greengrass's conclusion as a way of appealing to Harry's emotion to try and convince him, once more, to bend the rules<ref>{{PM}} - [https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/quidditch-world-cup-2014-daily-prophet-reports Quidditch World Cup 2014: Daily Prophet reports]: \":We do not comment on the top secret work of the Auror department,\"</ref>.\n\nAt some point later, he stole investigation files regarding the investigation into the disappearance of the London Five, where he discovered that the cited reason given for closing the case, namely the strain of the budget, did not correlate with the actual costs of the investigation, prompting him to issue a complaint to the Ministry's [[Accounting Department]] and demand an explanation for the inaccuracy in their financial records. Around the same time, Mr Fawley received a letter from a witch by the name of [[Amorette Deneuve]], in which she expressed the belief that [[Love]] was \"''the greatest and most dangerous magic in the world''\", describing it something that \"''imbues itself into our very bones, our very souls.''\" This lead Grim Fawely to believe that the power of love might just be the key to find his wife.
