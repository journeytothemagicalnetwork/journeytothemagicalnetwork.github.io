Writer and CONTENT confirmed it to be Year 3. -->\n[[File:Liz Tuttle - Hogwarts Mystery.png|140px|thumb|left|Liz Tuttle taking notes during a Care of Magical Creatures class]]\nDuring her third year, Liz took [[Care of Magical Creatures]]<ref name=\"HM41cmc\"/> and [[Divination (class)|Divination]]<ref name=\"HM62d\"/> as electives. She befriended [[Hufflepuff]] [[Penny Haywood]] at some point during her year, before meeting [[Jacob's sibling|a friend of Penny's]], who was looking for ingredients for [[Polyjuice Potion]]. Liz pointed her wand at the person and demanded them to choose between the [[Billywig]], [[Bowtruckle]] and [[Bundimun]].<ref name=\"Polyjuice\"/>\n\n====Fourth year====\nIn the first [[Care of Magical Creatures]] class during the [[1987\u20131988 school year]], aside from [[Barnaby Lee]], Liz appeared to be one of the friendlier Slytherin students, who showed genuine interest in the course. She exclaimed to not having seen anything as beautiful as a [[Fire crab|Fire Crab]] shooting [[Fire|flame]] out its rear.<ref name=\"HM41cmc\"/>\n\nShe later mentioned during another Care of Magical Creatures class that she had attended a luau in [[Fiji]] where Fire Crabs were used.<ref name=\"HM411cmc\">{{HM|4|11|cmc}}</ref>\n\n====Fifth year====\nWhen [[Jacob's sibling]] went to talk to the [[Bloody Baron]] to ask about [[Duncan Ashe]], Liz joined them along with fellow Slytherins [[Barnaby Lee]], [[Merula Snyde]] and [[Ismelda Murk]].

It was at the groups first meeting in the [[Hog's Head Inn]] that she learned of the malevolent organisation \"[[R]]\" and its [[Plot to find the Cursed Vaults|motives]] to locate the final Cursed Vault before them.<ref name=\"hm20\"/>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nShe was socially awkward and had difficulty with befriending others, and most other students viewed her as weird. She loved [[magic]]al [[creature]]s and had the desire to become a [[Magizoologist]] like [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]].<ref name=\"Polyjuice\"/> She cared deeply the well-being of creatures: she was afraid the [[blood]] on the [[Bloody Baron]] was the blood of an animal,<ref name=\"Y5Ch6\"/> and she was known to object to animal-to-object [[Transfiguration]]s.<ref name=\"HM716t\">{{HM|7|16|t}}</ref>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Potion]]s''': Liz achieved an '[[Outstanding]]' in her O.W.L.
