[[1979]]-[[1980]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]]. He was in the same year as [[Harry Potter]] and was Sorted into either [[Hufflepuff]] or [[Ravenclaw]] house.<ref name=\"PM\">{{PM}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n*Anglicised form of the Irish name Caoimh\u00edn, derived from the older Irish C\u00f3emgein, composed of the Old Irish elements c\u00f3em \"kind, gentle, handsome\" and gein \"birth\". Saint Caoimh\u00edn established a monastery in Glendalough, Ireland in the 6th century and is the patron saint of Dublin.\n*''Entwhistle'' could be a form of ''Entwistle'' which is an English habitual name from the village of Entwisle in Lancashire, named from Old English henna \u2018(water) hen\u2019 or ened \u2018duck\u2019 + twisla \u2018tongue of land in a river fork\u2019[https://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?surname=entwistle].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Kevin Entwhistle is listed as a [[Ravenclaw]] on the list of students in a page of [[J. K. Rowling]]'s notes shown on {{HPM}}. However, as two listed Hufflepuffs ([[Anthony Goldstein]] and [[Michael Corner]]) had their houses changed to Ravenclaw in the novels as published, two of those listed as Ravenclaws must have been changed to Hufflepuff. Entwhistle may be one of those whose house was changed.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{HPM}} {{1st Mention}}\n*{{PM}} {{Mention}}\n*{{WW}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Entwhistle, Kevin}}\n\n[[de:Kevin Entwhistle]]\n[[es:Kevin Entwhistle]]\n[[pl:Kevin Entwhistle]]\n[[fr:Kevin Entwhistle]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Entwhistle family|Kevin]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1991]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
