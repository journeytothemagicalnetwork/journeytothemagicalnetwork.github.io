She was also capable of teaching her Flying students how to perform the [[Gripping Charm]].<ref name=\"HM629\">{{HM|6|29|f}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nRolanda is a feminine form of Roland, a name of Germanic origin that means \"fame-land\", \"fame of the land\", \"old and wise\", or \"judicious, wise\". Roland was a paladin of Charlemagne and a principal figure in the Matter of France. The \"Roland\" was a Franco-German missile system, and the WWI aircraft manufacturer Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft was known for their various \"Roland\" designs.\n\nHooch may come from Hoch or Hoog, Germanic words that mean \"high\" or \"tall.\"\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Madam Hooch WU.PNG|150px|thumb|Madam Hooch as she appears in {{WU}}]]\n[[File:LEGOHooch.jpg|150px|thumb|Hooch as a LEGO minifigure (2018 edition)]]\n[[File:Legomadamhooch.png|150px|thumb|Madam Hooch in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]\n[[File:Rolanda Hooch - PAS.png|150px|thumb|Rolanda Hooch as seen in {{PAS}}]]\n*Madam Hooch was played by [[Zo\u00eb Wanamaker]] in the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|film adaptation]] of {{PS}}. Madam Hooch did not reappear in any of the following [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]], as Wanamaker had only signed up for one film.\n*Like [[Quirinus Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]], Madam Hooch's first name was never mentioned in the books. {{TCG}} lists it as Rolanda.\n*Prior to the release of the first film, IMDB listed her first name as Xiomara.\n*In an episode of the Britcom series ''{{wplink|My Family}}'', in which Wanamaker plays Susan, one of her sons pulls a trading card from a box of cereal and exclaims ''\"Hey look, Madam Hooch!\"'' Also, in a later episode during Hallowe'en when Susan is dressed as a witch and is trying to encourage her husband to join in, he tells her she ''\"can take your [[Nimbus 2000]] and stick it where the sun doesn't shine.''\"\n*On an episode of ''{{wplink|The Paul O'Grady Show}}'' Zo\u00eb Wanamaker said she was disappointed that she was never asked to return to the Harry Potter [[Harry Potter (film series)|saga]] and would not mind doing so for [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (film)|the last two films]].\n*[[Zo\u00eb Wanamaker]] was one of three [[United States of America|American]] actors who appeared in the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|film adaptation]] of {{PS}}, the others being [[Eleanor Columbus]], who played [[Susan Bones]], and [[Verne Troyer]], who played [[Griphook]]. It should be noted that though she was born in the States, she is in fact British.\n*On the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|first game of the series]] (GBA version), when Harry casts a [[spell]] that hits Hooch, she says that she's never been insulted that way since an anti-aircraft singed her broom during the [[First World War|Great War]] ([[1914]]-[[1918]]). This indicates that Hooch was born before [[1918]], possibly in the [[1900s]], seeing as she was already capable of broom flight. The fact that she owned a [[Silver Arrow]] supports this, seen as the broom was manufactured very early in the [[20th century|twentieth century]].\n*In the PC version of the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{OOTP}}, Madam Hooch is never seen, although she is mentioned by one of the students in the [[Clock Tower]].\n*To create Madam Hooch's yellow hawk-like eyes, special contact lenses were used.\n*Madam Hooch is the only Hogwarts teacher (excluding members of staff who do not teach, such as Madam Pomfrey and Madam Pince) to be referred to as 'Madam' rather than 'Professor'. The exact reasons for this are unknown, although it is possible that it is because she only teaches the first-years, and the majority of her job involves Quidditch matches as opposed to actual teaching. Alternately, she may not be considered a Professor as flying is primarily a physical discipline rather than an academic one. \n**Though she is commonly only depicted as teaching first years, in {{HM}}, Hooch is also seen teaching more advanced manoeuvres to later years. If this is taken as cannon, it does contradict the theory of her not having a professorship due to only teaching first years. \n*[[J. K. Rowling]] stated in an interview with [[PotterCast]] on [[17 December]] [[2007]] that \"Madam Hooch really did not have any romantic backstory. Well, not my invention, I don't know\".<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/1217-pottercast-anelli.html]</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Rolanda Hooch}}\n*{{PS}} {{1st}}\n*{{PS|F}}\n*{{PS|G}}\n*{{COS}}\n*{{COS|G}} {{C|Not in the PC version}}\n*{{POA}}\n*{{POA|F}} {{C|Mentioned in Tour of Portrait Gallery on Disc 2 Special Features}}<ref>During the Tour of the Portrait Gallery at the end of ''The Quest of Sir Cadogan'', we come across a portrait of a witch on a broomstick and the narrator asks her if she has been practising with Madam Hooch.</ref>\n*{{OOTP}}\n*{{OOTP|G}} {{Mention}}\n*{{HBP}}\n*{{CC}}\n*{{CC|P}}\n*{{LEGO|B}}\n*{{LEGO|C}}\n*{{QWC}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}}\n*{{LEGO}}\n*{{TCG}} {{1st ID}}\n*{{PM}}\n*{{WW}}\n*{{HPV|CH}}\n*{{HM}}\n*{{WU}}\n*{{PAS}}\n*{{MA}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Staff}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hooch, Rolanda}}\n[[ca:Rolanda Hooch]]\n[[de:Rolanda Hooch]]\n[[de2:Rolanda Hooch]]\n[[es:Rolanda Hooch]]\n[[fr:Ren\u00e9e Bibine]]\n[[he:\u05e8\u05d5\u05dc\u05e0\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d5\u05e5']]\n[[it:Rolanda Bumb]]\n[[ja:\u30ed\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30fb\u30d5\u30fc\u30c1]]\n[[nl:Madame Hooch]]\n[[no:Rolanda Hopp]]\n[[pl:Rolanda Hooch]]\n[[pt-br:Rolanda Hooch]]\n[[ru:\u0420\u043e\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430 \u0422\u0440\u044e\u043a]]\n[[sv:Rolanda Hooch]]\n[[uk:\u0420\u043e\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430 \u0413\u0443\u0447]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Centenarians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Foundables]]\n[[Category:Gilderoy Lockhart's fans]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts employees]]\n[[Category:Quidditch coaches]]\n[[Category:Quidditch referees]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]\n[[Category:Yellow-eyed individuals]]"
