As revealed in ''[[Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies]]'', Chapter 3 (Horace Slughorn), Slughorn had \"completed half a century of service\" at the time of his retirement in [[1981]], meaning he started teaching there circa [[1931]]. Callidora, born in [[1915]], presumably attended Hogwarts from [[1926]] to [[1933]], and thus would have been a student of Slughorn for at least part of her time at Hogwarts.</ref>\n|loyalty = *[[House of Black]]\n*[[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]\n**[[Slytherin]]\n*[[Longbottom family]]\n}}\n'''Callidora Longbottom''' (n\u00e9e '''Black''') (b. [[1915]]) was a [[pure-blood]] witch, the eldest daughter of [[Arcturus Black II]] and [[Lysandra Yaxley]] and sister of [[Charis Black|Charis]] and [[Cedrella Black|Cedrella]]. She married [[Harfang Longbottom]], and the couple had two children, a [[Harfang Longbottom's son|son]] and [[Harfang Longbottom's daughter|a daughter]].<ref name=\"BFT\"/> She is related to the [[Crouch family|Crouch]] and [[Weasley family|Weasley]] families through her sisters, and may be related to [[Frank Longbottom's father|Mr Longbottom]] and his [[Frank Longbottom|son]] and [[Neville Longbottom|grandson]].\n\n==Etymology==\n*''Callidora'' means \"gift of beauty\" in Greek.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/submit/view.php?name=callidora Behind the Name: Callidora]</ref> It is also the name of a [[Wikipedia:Setiostoma callidora|species of sedge moths]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Callidora's sister [[Cedrella Black|Cedrella]] was disowned by their [[House of Black|family]] for marrying [[Septimus Weasley]], a \"[[blood traitor]]\". Given that Callidora was not burned off the [[House of Black|Black family tree]] tapestry for her marriage, this suggests that the [[Longbottom family|Longbottoms]] are considered to be a more \"respectable\" pure-blood family than [[Weasley family|Weasleys]]. Interestingly, the [[Longbottom family]] would be seen as \"blood traitors\" now because they opposed [[Voldemort]]'s reign and the notion of blood purity. \n*Since Callidora and [[Cassiopeia Black|Cassiopeia]] were born in the same year, it is most likely that they were classmates at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].\n*Callidora's and Elladora's pictures on the family tree in the film are the same.\n*Callidora was not featured on the Longbottom family tree shown on Pottermore.\n*As Callidora and her sisters Cedrella and Charis were born between [[1915]] and [[1919]], they would have been three of the many first ever Slytherins [[Horace Slughorn]] taught when he became Potions teacher in 1931. \n\n==Appearances==\n*{{OOTP|F}} {{C|Appears on Black family tapestry}}\n*{{OOTP|G}} {{C|Seen on [[House of Black|Black family]] tree tapestry}}\n*{{DH|G1}} {{C|Seen on [[House of Black|Black family]] tree tapestry}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Black, Callidora}}\n\n[[de:Callidora Black]]\n[[ru:\u041a\u0430\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0411\u043b\u044d\u043a]]\n[[es:Callidora Black]]\n[[fr:Callidora Black]]\n[[it:Callidora Black]]\n[[pl:Callidora Longbottom]]\n[[Category:1915 births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:House of Black]]\n[[Category:Longbottom family]]\n[[Category:Married individuals]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Pure-bloods]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1920s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
