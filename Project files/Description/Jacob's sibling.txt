You broke a considerable number of school rules, but you did so to break an ancient curse. All of Hogwarts owes you a debt of gratitude. I expect history will label you a hero.|[[Albus Dumbledore]] to Jacob's sibling|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\nThis '''student''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch or wizard]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] between [[1984]] and [[1991]]. Their brother [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]]'s expulsion from Hogwarts for endangering fellow students in his quest to find the [[Cursed Vaults]] had an impact on his younger sibling's [[first year]] at Hogwarts when many other students whispered about them for their elder sibling's breaking of school rules which had disgraced their shared schoolhouse. The incident was well-covered in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', as was Jacob's running away from home, which had a profound effect on the younger sibling.\n\nThroughout their seven years at Hogwarts, they successfully broke into every one of the five Cursed Vaults, showing immense bravery, intelligence, dedication and resourcefulness. They maintained friendships with lots of schoolmates and went through exciting adventures together, rescuing Jacob from the [[Buried Vault]]<ref name=\"HM530\"/> and breaking the ancient [[statue curse]] in the [[Sunken Vault]].<ref name=\"HM642\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life {{C|1972/1973-1984}}===\nThey were born in [[1972]] or [[1973]] to [[Wizardkind|magical parents]]. They had one<ref name=\"HM72\">{{HM|7|2}}</ref> older sibling, [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]].\n\nThey apparently lived in close proximity to [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] dwellings,<ref>They were forbidden from riding brooms as a child because it was illegal. As we see with the [[Weasley family|Weasleys]], riding brooms outside school does not constitute a breach of the [[Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery]], but if they lived near Muggles, then flying brooms might constitute a breach of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]], which would be far worse.</ref> but they showed little knowledge of Muggle life as an adolescent and must have had limited interaction with their neighbours.<ref>They do not know what a car is in the \"Christmas at the Burrow\" adventure.</ref>\n\nWhen they were five or six years old, they and Jacob pretended to duel with [[Liquorice Wand]]s. At one point, Jacob convinced his sibling to steal [[Sickle]]s from their mother's coat pockets.\n\nDuring their childhood, their parents worked together to teach Jacob and his sibling that they could not go around flaunting their [[magic]]. In particular, their [[Jacob's mother|mother]] was strict about the use of magic outside of school, refusing both of her children to ride a [[broomstick]] before they began attending school.\n\nThey performed [[wandless magic]] when they were young, shattering one of their mother's tea sets when they sneezed. Their mother thought Jacob had done it until they repeated the feat with a vase a few weeks later when Jacob was at school. On another occasion, they laughed a flower back to life which their mother was pretty pleased with.<ref name=\"HM72\"/>\n\nJacob began attending Hogwarts during their childhood. Tragedy struck the family when they received an [[owl]] from [[Professor]] [[Albus Dumbledore]], informing them that Jacob had been [[Discipline at Hogwarts#Expulsion|expelled]] for endangering his fellow students in his attempt to prove that the fabled [[Cursed Vaults]] really existed.\n\nShortly after being sent home, Jacob ran away and went missing; many believed that he went on to serve [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], whereas other rumours said he had returned to Hogwarts after his expulsion to resume his search. His younger sibling would, years later, reject the former possibility. When his sibling and mother heard he went missing, they were upset over the news and cried.\n\n====Meeting Rowan Khanna====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Rowan Khanna|Hi, I'm Rowan Khanna!

Rowan suggested to start at [[Flourish and Blotts]]. While picking up ''[[The Standard Book of Spells]]'', Jacob's sibling excitedly remarked how they looked forward to learning all the [[Charm]]s; upon picking up {{FB}}, they said they were familiar with it and thought it to be brilliant. Afterwards, they journeyed to [[Ollivanders|Ollivanders Wand Shop]] to purchase their [[Jacob's sibling's first wand|first wand]]: [[Garrick Ollivander]] expressed both concern and curiosity about what sort of effect their brother's choices had made on this individual, but still looked forward to seeing what kind of life they would lead.

Upon arrival, they were greeted at the [[Great Hall]] by the rest of the students and the staff. [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] proceeded to provide them with a short explanation of the four [[Hogwarts Houses]], voicing her hope that all of the newcomers would make fine additions to the ranks of great witches and wizards that each House had produced in the past. When Jacob's sibling was called to be [[Sorting Ceremony|Sorted]], the [[Sorting Hat]] remarked that \"[it hadn't] ''seen one like this in a long time''\", and took their choice of House into account \u2014 which was the same as their brother [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]]'s. Later, they found that [[Rowan Khanna|Rowan]] had been Sorted into the same House as them.<ref name=\"HM12\">{{HM|1|2}}</ref>\n\nWhen the sorting was done and all [[First year|first-year]]s had found places to sit among their new housemates, [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] rose and stood behind the [[Owl Lecturn]] in front of the [[High Table]]. He gave a brief speech of welcomes, educated the new arrivals on the rules of the [[House Cup]] and on what a great honour it would be to win it. At the end of the [[Start-of-Term Feast]], Jacob's sibling's [[Head of House]] moved to stand beside the [[Headmaster]], announcing to the students of their house that it was time for them to move to their [[common room]]. Once there, Jacob's sibling reunited with Rowan, and the two briefly discussed their shared excitement over finally attending school and their new House before agreeing to go to bed, as they would have to be up bright and early for [[Charms (class)|Charms]] first thing in the morning.<ref name=\"HM12\"/>\n\n=====Charms class=====\n{{Dialogue a-b|Jacob's sibling|Pleased to meet you, Professor Flitwick.

Recognising the individual as Jacob's sibling, Filius Flitwick answered in kind words, claiming that he was certain the student would do just fine, as [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|their older brother]] had been one of his most skilled students at Hogwarts prior to his expulsion. Even so, he subtly warned them against trouble-making, adding that Jacob had been one of his most rebellious students as well. For the student's first class, they studied the [[Wand-Lighting Charm]].<ref name=\"HM12c\">{{HM|1|2|c}}</ref>\n\n=====Meeting Merula Snyde=====\n{{Quote|Merula Snyde. First-year Slytherin.

Jacob's sibling intervened on Rowan's behalf and stood up for them against Merula, but before their argument went any further, [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] ordered them to get into the [[Potions Classroom]] for the [[Potions (class)|subsequent class]]. The animosity formed between Merula and Jacob's sibling grew in that lesson, for at the end of the class, Merula sabotaged the [[Cure for Boils]] Jacob's sibling brewed with [[Bulbadox powder]], which caused the potion to explode, resulting in them losing ten points for their house due to their presumed clumsiness.<ref name=\"HM12p\">{{HM|1|2|p}}</ref>\n\n=====Merula's prank=====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Jacob's sibling|What is that thing?!|Merula Snyde|A deadly plant called Devil's Snare.

The Prefect gave Jacob's sibling a note from Professor Snape stating he would consider restoring the points if they fetched some [[Pickled Slugs]] from a storage room. Jacob's sibling found the room following instructions on the note, but the room turned out to be filled with [[Devil's Snare]], which quickly tied Jacob's sibling up.

She thanked them for having the courage to stand up to Merula, the school bully, and offered them her help in whatever they needed, which Jacob's sibling appreciated. Once they met Snape, Jacob's sibling lost house points for their house, while Merula did not. Before Snape could dispense punishment, however, he was interrupted by the school caretaker, [[Argus Filch]], who required him and so Snape was forced to depart from the two students although he unknowingly was followed by Jacob's sibling and Merula Snyde who subsequently overheard Snape and Filch talking about the mysterious [[Cursed Vaults]], resulting in Jacob's sibling deciding to try to find them. They told [[Rowan Khanna]] about it and they went back to the corridor where the conversation had taken place, only to find a door which was locked.

[[Chiara Lobosca]], a werewolf student (in human form at the time), spotted Greyback and two werewolves emerging from the [[Forbidden Forest]] and tried to attack them, but was easily defeated. Shortly afterwards, Greyback and his two werewolf companions encountered Jacob's sibling, who defiantly stood up to them and briefly held off one of the two werewolves with their spells. Before Greyback could better coordinate the assault on and hence overwhelm the young pupil, however, he caught the scent of [[Albus Dumbledore]] and made a hasty retreat, who arrived just too late to capture him. The headmaster briefly examined the injured student on the ground and instructed the other one to return to their dormitory while he attended to Chiara, explaining that he would contact the Ministry of Magic and ask them to send an expert from the [[Werewolf Capture Unit]] to help to stop Grayback.\n\nThe next full moon, Greyback and his army attacked Hogwarts again. This time, they encountered Jacob's sibling and [[Cecil Lee]], whom the Ministry had sent on Dumbledore's behest. During the confrontation, Cecil tried to use the [[Homorphus Charm]] on Greyback's werewolf companions, but, as he was out of range, it failed. While Cecil was surrounded by the two other werewolves, Greyback transformed. He was attacked by Chiara in her werewolf form, but swiftly and brutally put her out of action by knocking her unconscious. After this, Jacob's sibling successfully held him at bay by some swift-spell-casting. Having fended off the two werewolves attacking him, who had retreated to Greyback's side, Cecil swiftly stepped forward and conjured ropes from the end of his wand to restrain the pack leader. Having captured the three werewolves, Cecil agreed not to capture Chiara due to her heroic actions.\n\nNot long afterwards, Greyback had already managed to escape from the Werewolf Capture Unit, though Mr Lee was confident that enough members of his pack had been rounded up to force him to keep his head low for a while.<ref name=\"HH\">{{HM|1|Howling Hallowe'en}}</ref>\n\n=====Dealing with the cursed ice=====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Merula Snyde|The ice st-stuck m-me t-to the f-floor, and k-keeps sp-spreading over me!|Jacob's sibling|It's the same ice from my vision\u2026|It's spreading over the door too!

[[Penny Haywood]] was later found in the [[Hospital Wing]], having been attacked by a mysterious creature. Jacob's sibling and [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] searched the [[Training Grounds]], where Jacob's sibling was faced with a [[Dementor]]. Tonks arrived in time and cast the [[Patronus Charm]] to drive the Dementor away.<ref name=\"Patronus\">{{HM|4|Conjure a Patronus}}</ref><ref>[https://jamcity.helpshift.com/a/harry-potter-hogwarts-mystery/?l=en&s=adventures&f=expecto-patronum Expecto Patronum! | Jam City Support] - This event takes place after Chapter 1 of Year 4.</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling asked Tonks to teach them the Patronus Charm, and Tonks brought them to [[Hogsmeade]] to play a prank to enlighten their mood. However, they found [[R's notes#R's note (IV)|another note]] from R there, saying the Dementors were unleashed but nothing more. While preparing for the study, [[Merula Snyde]] joined them. Although their first attempts were unsuccessful, they learned more from [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]. They found the Dementor again on the Training Grounds, and Jacob's sibling successfully conjured a corporeal Patronus which chased the Dementor out of the school. Afterwards, Merula discovered [[R's notes#R's note (V)|another note]] from R saying congratulations.<ref name=\"Patronus\"/>\n\n=====Learning about Rakepick=====\nJacob's sibling decided to investigate Rakepick and asked the professors their opinions about her, which were mostly negative. Rakepick found out about that and invited Jacob's sibling to a private conversation, in which she told them to stop doing so, while continuing with her plan of using their assistance.<ref name=\"HM42\">{{HM|4|2}}</ref>\n\n=====Preparing for the Forbidden Forest=====\nJacob's sibling asked Professor [[Silvanus Kettleburn|Kettleburn]] what is the best way to go to the Forbidden Forest, and he agreed to answer that question if they studied enough about [[bowtruckle]]s. At some point, they received a forged letter supposedly signed by Kettleburn, which was actually a bait to lure them to the [[Courtyard]], where a [[Ben Copper|cloaked figure]] attacked them with the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] and told them to stay away from the Cursed Vaults, the Forbidden Forest and Rakepick, further adding that \"death is coming to Hogwarts\" and may come to them as well if they disobeyed. The figure told that someone would eventually remove the [[curse]], but it is unknown who did so.<ref name=\"HM43\">{{HM|4|3}}</ref>\n\nKettleburn, after satisfied with Jacob's sibling's study on bowtruckles, answered their question. He said that by using a broom they could get to the forest mostly undetected. Meanwhile, Rakepick repeatedly invited Jacob's sibling, their friends, as well as their enemies [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] and [[Ismelda Murk|Ismelda]], to meet at the [[Training Grounds]] for a little competition to elect an assistant to her. They learned the [[Blasting Curse]] and duelled one another.<ref name=\"HM44\">{{HM|4|4}}</ref>\n\n=====Attending the Celestial Ball=====\n[[File:CelestialBall2.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Celestial Ball]]\n[[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] announced in the [[Great Hall]] that a [[Celestial Ball]] would soon take place. Jacob's sibling helped [[Penny Haywood|Penny]] become the leader of the [[Celestial Ball decorating committee|decorating committee]] and made decorations with friends. They convinced a couple of their friends, who had refused to go to the ball, to join them, while [[Andre Egwu]] helped design suits for them. He also designed three outfits for Jacob's sibling, who chose one from them shortly before the ball. They attended the ball with a date and had fun.<ref name=\"CB\">{{HM|4|Celestial Ball}} - This event takes place after Chapter 4 of Year 4.</ref>\n\n=====Searching for the Forest Vault=====\nThey then proceeded to try to get a [[Broomstick|broom]], first by asking [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] to borrow one, which she refused due to the [[Black Lake incident]] and not trusting them, and later by attempting to steal one from [[Argus Filch|Filch]]'s [[Room 234-00|office]], where all brooms they found were broken. They incidentally found, however, [[R's notes#R's note (VI)|another message]] [[Transfiguration|transfigured]] into a black quill, which was a threat from [[R]] to [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]] telling her to leave [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. As a last resort, they asked another student to borrow their broom; the student was reluctant at first, but Jacob's sibling managed to convince them to borrow the broom by talking to them at [[Three Broomsticks Inn|Three Broomsticks]].<ref name=\"HM45\">{{HM|4|5}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling later went to the Forbidden Forest by [[broomstick]] together with [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]] and another friend. They landed at a [[Forest Grove|grove]], which had been pinpointed as the ideal entry point by them, but found no sign of a [[Cursed Vaults|Cursed Vault]]. They returned to the castle, and Jacob's sibling searched for a missing drawing of their brother [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] in [[Jacob's room|his room]], which turned out to be a closer examination of the grove. It revealed a structure behind the grove as a [[Centaur Camp]].<ref name=\"HM46\">{{HM|4|6}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling and another friend went to the grove once more, where they met and duelled [[Torvus]], who told them afterwards that Jacob had stolen one of his arrows that had belonged to his father. Jacob's sibling showed him [[Torvus's arrow|the arrow]] they had found in the [[Vault of Fear]], but its arrowhead was missing. Torvus said that his father had told him about the [[Forest Vault]] and wanted to help Jacob when he had tried to enter the Vault. Jacob had wanted to use Torvus' arrow to open its door and break the curse, but Torvus had refused, as it had been his family's heirloom, so Jacob had stolen it from the Camp, which had led to Torvus' exile. Jacob's sibling offered to find the arrowhead, and Torvus in exchange would read the planets to look into the future.<ref name=\"HM46\"/>\n\nJacob's sibling later met with Charlie in the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]] and found out that he knew Torvus too. They went back to Jacob's room to research the arrowhead, and found a drawing which depicted the arrowhead as having been carved from a single giant gemstone. Below it was a note that suggested Jacob had buried it to hide it from \"both of them\".<ref name=\"HM47\">{{HM|4|7}}</ref>\n\n=====Going on a date=====\nJacob's sibling was caught writing a note to somebody they had a crush on during [[Potions (class)|Potions class]]. Several friends of them helped them find some hiding spots from the rumours about them, and [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] told them some dating advices. [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] and [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] helped them select a date location, and [[Andre Egwu]] designed their outfit. They asked their date out in the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]] and they agreed.<ref name=\"FirstDate\">{{HM|4|First Date}}</ref><ref>[https://jamcity.helpshift.com/a/harry-potter-hogwarts-mystery/?l=en&s=adventures&f=first-date First Date! | Jam City Support] - This event takes place after Chapter 7 of Year 4.</ref>\n\nAndre met with Jacob's sibling in the [[Classroom 1B|Transfiguration Classroom]] and possibly did some makeup and grew some facial hair on them. They invited their date to a location in [[Hogsmeade]], but couldn't think of much to talk about. Tonks and Charlie came to sit a few feets away, and Tonks later made some mess around them, so the owner closed the place and the date ended in a failure. They talked to [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] about it, who suggested them meet with their date again. They talked with each other to eliminate worries and stargazed together in the [[Courtyard]].<ref name=\"FirstDate\"/>\n\n=====Searching for the arrowhead=====\nJacob's sibling decided to borrow [[Patricia Rakepick|Madam Rakepick]]'s [[Niffler]], [[Sickleworth]], to help them dig for the head of [[Torvus's arrow|Torvus' arrow]].<ref name=\"HM48\">{{HM|4|8}}</ref> Rakepick later came searching too, but it turned out she only wanted [[Key gifted to Argus Filch|a key]] back. After failing to find it inside of [[Hogwarts Castle]],<ref name=\"HM49\">{{HM|4|9}}</ref> they went to the [[Forest Grove]] with [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] and another student. Sickleworth ran inside a hole and they followed his trace there, where they met [[Red Cap in the Forbidden Forest|a Red Cap]] and were driven out of the hole. They went back to Hogwarts Castle, met [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] and learned about Red Caps together.<ref name=\"HM410\">{{HM|4|10}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling and [[Penny Haywood|Penny]] gathered ingredients and brewed some [[Beautification Potion]] together. Before they could fly into the [[Forbidden Forest]], however, [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] discovered them, broke their [[Broomstick|broom]] and told them to expect further letters.<ref name=\"HM411\">{{HM|4|11}}</ref>\n\n=====Spying on Rakepick=====\nJacob's sibling later went to see [[Severus Snape|Snape]], and Snape told them he had only acted to look as if they had been at odds, and that [[Patricia Rakepick|Madam Rakepick]] had been watching them ever since she had arrived. He asked them to help him uncover her true motivations at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], by fetching potion ingredients from strange places and watching if Rakepick would also be there.<ref name=\"HM412\">{{HM|4|12}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling went to the [[Great Hall]] and saw Rakepick talking to [[Argus Filch|Filch]] about [[Key gifted to Argus Filch|the key]] she just found. Filch told Rakepick he had received the key as a part of a mysterious package along with three [[Black Quill (R's)|Black Quill]]<nowiki/>s. They then went to the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]], and saw Rakepick talking to [[Rosmerta]] about the notebook [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] had left here and asking whether Jacob had also left [[Marauder's Map|a map of Hogwarts]], which had been in [[Room 234-00|Filch's office]] but was no longer there. They then went to the [[Hospital Wing]], and saw Rakepick discussing the [[Sleepwalking curse|sleepwalking epidemic]] with [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]]. Rakepick spotted them and revealed she knew they were spying for Snape.<ref name=\"HM412\"/>\n\nJacob's sibling returned to meet Snape, and Snape told them he believed Rakepick had a student as a co-conspirator. He expected Rakepick to know about his intentions, and said that Rakepick would be waiting for his response. He gave Jacob's sibling a bottle of [[Garrotting Gas]] because he believed Rakepick might try to kill them.<ref name=\"HM412\"/>\n\n=====Preparing for the Forest Vault=====\nJacob's sibling, [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] and a friend returned to the [[Red Cap's Hole]] with their [[Beautification Potion]] and used it on [[Red Cap in the Forbidden Forest|the Red Cap]]. He was alarmed by his slightly more handsome look and climbed away, allowing [[Sickleworth]] to find the [[Torvus's arrow|arrowhead]]. They then went to the [[Forest Grove]], and Jacob's sibling cast the [[Levitation Charm]] on themselves to see higher, and found [[Torvus]]. They repaired his arrow and gave it back, but Torvus said he needed them to bring [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] to him.<ref name=\"HM413\">{{HM|4|13}}</ref>\n\nAt this time, a lot of magical creatures were at large around the [[Hogwarts Castle|castle]], and Jacob's sibling helped Hagrid, [[Silvanus Kettleburn|Professor Kettleburn]] and [[Amos Diggory]] recapture them.<ref name=\"MCE\">{{HM|4|Magical Creatures Everywhere}} - This event takes place after Chapter 13 of Year 4.</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling and their friends did some preparation for the [[Forest Vault]], during which Jacob's sibling learned [[Arania Exumai]] from [[Patricia Rakepick|Madam Rakepick]].<ref name=\"HM414\">{{HM|4|14}}</ref> They then went to invite Hagrid on their trip, but [[Hagrid's Hut|his hut]] was unfortunately filled with [[Bundimun]]s.<ref name=\"HM415\">{{HM|4|15}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling went to the [[courtyard]] to finalise their plan with their friends, but Charlie and Rowan were hit with a [[Full Body-Bind Curse]], leaving Jacob's sibling to duel with the reappeared [[Ben Copper|R's messenger]]. Then Madam Rakepick appeared and defeated the messenger. They lifted the messenger's disguise, only to find that it was [[Ben Copper]], who didn't seem to remember what had happened.<ref name=\"HM415\"/>\n\nJacob's sibling later returned to Hagrid's Hut, told Hagrid what had happened and helped him clear the Bundimuns with the [[Scouring Charm]], after which Hagrid agreed to go into the Forest with them.<ref name=\"HM415\"/>\n\n=====Entering the Forest Vault=====\nJacob's sibling, [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]], [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] and a friend (possibly [[Penny Haywood|Penny]], [[William Weasley|Bill]] or [[Rowan Khanna|Rowan]]) entered the [[Forbidden Forest]] and met with [[Torvus]]. They entered the [[Aragog's Lair|Spider's Lair]] and encountered [[Forest Vault Acromantula|an Acromantula]] immediately. Hagrid requested to take a look around, which the Acromantula agreed, but then he trapped Charlie, Hagrid and Torvus in webs. Their friend temporarily took care of the Acromantula while Jacob's sibling managed to save them using the [[Severing Charm]]. However, the Acromantula then recovered and duelled Jacob's sibling. In the end, Jacob's sibling used ''[[Arania Exumai]]'' on the Acromantula and won.<ref name=\"HM416\">{{HM|4|16}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Forest Vault - Hogwarts Mystery.png|250px|thumb|right|Jacob's sibling and their friends entering the [[Forest Vault]]]]\nThey found the door to the [[Forest Vault]] and [[Infiltration of the Forest Vault (1988)|entered]]. Jacob's sibling touched the centre column, but nothing happened, suggesting they should once again use their brother [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]]'s wand. They then heard Jacob's voice again, telling them only the [[Sunken Vault|final Cursed Vault]] was real, he was trapped in the [[Buried Vault|next Vault]], and they shouldn't let [[R|\"them\"]] get their first. They used Torvus' arrow on the column and it opened, revealing a portrait of a dragon and a sweater.<ref name=\"HM416\"/>\n\nOn their way out of the Forest, Jacob's sibling and their friends met [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] and [[Argus Filch|Filch]]. Dumbledore told Jacob's sibling they continued to exhibit little respect for Hogwarts's rules and himself, and gave them detention in the [[Hogwarts kitchens|Kitchens]] under [[Pitts]] next year. They then went to the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]] to celebrate.<ref name=\"HM416\"/>\n\nJacob's sibling got called into [[Headmaster's Office|Dumbledore's office]], but instead saw [[Patricia Rakepick|Madam Rakepick]] arrive via [[Floo Powder]], who congratulated them and said that she would guide them into their [[fifth year]] and change the rules to make their search for the Vaults easier, before revealing that she would be the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[professor]] next year.<ref name=\"HM416\"/>\n\n=====Restoring order in the Forbidden Forest=====\n{{Expand}}\nJacob's sibling helped restoring order in the [[Forbidden Forest]] following their [[Infiltration of the Forest Vault (1988)|break-in]] of the [[Forest Vault]].<ref name=\"TTF\">{{HM|4|TORVUS AND THE TROUBLED FOREST}}</ref>\n\n====Fifth year====\nJacob's sibling got [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] in [[Potions (class)|Potions]], [[Charms (class)|Charms]], [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]], [[Herbology]], [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], [[History of Magic]] and [[Care of Magical Creatures]].<ref name=\"OWL\">{{HM|5|Ordinary Wizarding Levels}} - This event takes place after Chapter 24 of Year 5.</ref> They most likely also got O.W.L.s in [[Divination]] and [[Astronomy]], two subjects which they continued to take in their sixth year.<ref>{{HM}}, [[Divination Classroom]] and [[Astronomy classroom]] are unlockable locations in Year 6.</ref>\n\n=====An unusual start=====\nAt the start of the [[1988\u20131989 school year]], their [[fifth year]], Jacob's sibling met [[Penny Haywood|Penny]]'s younger sister [[Beatrice Haywood|Beatrice]], who gave them a hand-made [[Puffskein]]. They later went to the Library and did some studying with [[William Weasley|Bill]], [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] and [[Percy Weasley]].<ref name=\"HM51\">{{HM|5|1}}</ref>\n\nAt night, Jacob's sibling and Bill were called by [[Patricia Rakepick|Professor Rakepick]] to the [[Training Grounds]], and found out that they, along with [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] had been chosen as Rakepick's apprentice [[Curse-Breaker]]s in their pursuit of the fourth [[Cursed Vaults|Cursed Vault]]. She taught them how to cast the [[Incarcerous Spell]] and had Jacob's sibling demonstrate it on Merula much to her chagrin.<ref name=\"HM51\"/>\n\nJacob's sibling then went to meet [[Ben Copper]] in the [[Courtyard]] where they discussed Ben's attack in the last year. Before they could finish their conversation, both were confronted and attacked by [[R's second messenger|another figure in a red cloak]]. The figure subdued both with a [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] before repeating their previous warning that death was coming to Hogwarts and telling them that they needed them alive and that before the school term ended, one of their friends would die.<ref name=\"HM51\"/>\n\n=====Finding Beatrice Haywood=====\nJacob's sibling was later invited to the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]] by [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] along with [[William Weasley|Bill]]. The three talked about how they should start co-operating. Soon, [[Penny Haywood|Penny]] came to inform that [[Beatrice Haywood|Beatrice]] was missing. The four decided to split into pairs. Jacob's sibling and one of the three searched the [[Red Cap]]'s Hole (where they found a [[rat]] which appeared to be [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]]) and [[Aragog's Lair|Spider's Lair]] (where they fighted [[Forest Vault Acromantula|the Acromantula]] again), but could not find Beatrice.<ref name=\"HM52\">{{HM|5|2}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling returned to meet the rest in the [[Potions Classroom]], where Penny was brewing a supposedly original [[Legilimency potion|potion]] which would temporarily gain her the power of [[Legilimency]] to look into her sister's mind. They helped her with the potion, but it didn't work.<ref name=\"HM52\"/>\n\nMerula discovered Beatrice stuck in a portrait beside the [[Grand Staircase]] and returned to alert the rest. They went there and met [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]], who said that the only way to free her was to find the next [[Cursed Vaults|Cursed Vault]] and break its curse, and that Beatrice might soon lose her connection to reality. [[Argus Filch|Filch]] came later and called Jacob's sibling to start their detention.<ref name=\"HM52\"/>\n\n=====Researching the portrait curse=====\nJacob's sibling went to the [[Hogwarts kitchens|kitchens]] and started serving detention under [[Pitts]]' instructions. They met [[Jae Kim]] who was too serving detention for bringing contraband to Hogwarts and selling them. He offered Jacob's sibling an opportunity to receive [[Fizzing Whizzbees]], a [[Probity Probe]] or a [[Revealer]] for free, among which Jacob's sibling chose one.<ref name=\"HM53\">{{HM|5|3}}</ref>\n\nThey then met with their friends (including Jae) in the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]] and studied ways for getting [[Beatrice Haywood|Beatrice]] out of the portrait. They guessed it might have been an [[Extension Charm]] that trapped Beatrice in, and studied it with [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]], who had a similar thought, but believed it could've been something more ancient and sinister. He then suggested Jacob's sibling talk to [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly Headless Nick]], who might know the origin of this curse.<ref name=\"HM53\"/>\n\nJacob's sibling and Sir Nicholas talked to the other portraits beside the [[Grand Staircase]], and found out that Beatrice had approached the protraits after having heard strange sounds like crackling and the flapping of wings, had touched one and had been pulled inside immediately. The portrait of [[Merlin]] also said there had been a faceless interloper who had tampered with the portraits. Sir Nicholas suggested Jacob's sibling talk to the resident portrait painter, [[Badeea Ali]].<ref name=\"HM53\"/>\n\n=====Sir Cadogan's knightly trials=====\nWhile the [[portrait curse]] hadn't been broken, [[Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]] gave Jacob's sibling a series of knightly trials to help them do so and also prepare for future perils. The first trial took place on the \"Land of Magical Creatures\", which was really the paddock where they had [[Care of Magical Creatures]] classes, and involved cleaning up the mess left by creatures such as a [[Fire Crab]], a [[Bowtruckle]] and a [[Unicorn]]. When they finished, Cadogan instructed them to look for a magical scroll in the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]]. They got it from [[Irma Pince|Madam Pince]], who also advised them to go to the [[Charms Classroom]], where they would later help [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] move heavy items. [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] also came along and asked Jacob's sibling to collect some [[Knotgrass]] for him. They did this with [[Andre Egwu|Andre]], who made them realise the trials were essentially a [[professor]]'s to-do list. They discussed this with [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], who suggested they demand an answer from Cadogan.<ref name=\"TTSC\">{{HM|5|The Trials of Sir Cadogan}} - This event takes place after Chapter 3 of Year 5.</ref>\n\nSoon, Jacob's sibling gathered a few of their friends and learned from Cadogan there would be three more trials. They \"dined in abundance\" in the [[Hogwarts kitchens|Kitchens]] and challenged [[Ben Copper|Ben]] to a duel. The final trial turned out to be a rematch with the [[Ice Knight]], who [[Patricia Rakepick|Professor Rakepick]] had reanimated, so Jacob's sibling found [[William Weasley|Bill]] and practised the [[Fire-Making Spell]] just like they did in their [[second year]]. They arrived outside the [[Vault of Ice]] once more with Bill and the Ice Knight showed up, beginning their fight. When they were finished, Jacob's sibling returned to meet Cadogan and reviewed their deeds, before Cadogan deemed them worthy of knighthood and rewarded them a [[Suit of armour|suit of knightly armour]].<ref name=\"TTSC\"/>\n\n=====Learning about the Marauder's Map=====\nJacob's sibling met [[Badeea Ali|Badeea]], who had actually painted [[Beatrice Haywood|Beatrice]] stuck in the portrait. They talked about magical portraits, while Badeea suggested Jacob's sibling be innovative and try new things. They went back to detention with [[Jae Kim|Jae]], who revealed Badeea knew how to [[Apparition|Apparate]] and also invented her own spells. They met [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] in the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]] and persuaded her to help save Beatrice. Merula suggested them search for the [[Marauder's Map]].<ref name=\"HM54\">{{HM|5|4}}</ref>\n\nRemembering [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]]'s conversation with [[Rosmerta]] last year, they planned to shock [[Argus Filch|Filch]] to induce them to talk about the Map. Filch opened a gift box, saw a cake with [[Mrs Norris]]' face and became happy, allowing Jacob's sibling to find out that it was Filch's guess that [[Peeves]] had stolen the Map from [[Room 234-00|his office]].<ref name=\"HM54\"/>\n\nJacob's sibling and Jae went to the [[Classroom 3C|Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom]], and made Peeves appear. Peeves said a friend of his, who hated [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] more than [[potion]]s, didn't want him to tell them where the map was, then disappeared. Jacob's sibling followed the trace and talked to [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], who didn't tell them anything about the Map, but said [[Penny Haywood|Penny]] had lost her focus and her chance of passing her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]].<ref name=\"HM54\"/>\n\nJacob's sibling went to comfort Penny, who wanted to brew a potion and needed the ingredients. They got a [[Unicorn horn]] from the [[Forest Grove]], some [[Porcupine quill]]s from the [[Classroom 1B|Transfiguration Classroom]], some powdered [[Moonstone]] from Jae, and some [[Syrup of Hellebore]] from the [[Herbology Classroom]]. They used them to brew a batch of [[Draught of Peace]], which successfully calmed Penny down.<ref name=\"HM55\">{{HM|5|5}}</ref>\n\n=====Outdoor celebration of magic=====\n[[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] asked Jacob's sibling to meet him in [[Hagrid's Garden|his garden]] and announced his participation in the upcoming [[outdoor celebration of magic]]. They asked around in the [[Great Hall]] and learned about the activities of the festival and the role of festival ambassadors, for which there were already students competing. For the first lesson of the celebration, [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] taught students the [[Gobstone to Skunk]] spell in the [[Courtyard]], but the lesson went awry when [[Tulip Karasu|Tulip]] tried to pet her [[skunk]], which filled the space with unpleasant smells. [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] talked to Jacob's sibling about her interest in becoming an ambassador before [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]'s [[potion]]s-reviewing class, which culminated in a quiz of potion ingredients given to the two. After class, Jacob's sibling discovered a love note under a [[gobstone]]. [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] chose to have the [[Charms (class)|Charms class]] be in Hagrid's Garden, where students would practise the [[Shrinking Charm]] on the [[pumpkin]]s. Another love letter showed up in the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]], where Jacob's sibling had conversations with both [[Penny Haywood|Penny]] and Merula, who were competing to be ambassadors. Throughout the celebration, they had also received implicit invitations to be one's date from several individuals.<ref name=\"FF\">{{HM|5|FESTIVAL FUN}} - This event takes place after Chapter 5 of Year 5.</ref>\n\n[[File:Jacob's sibling flying on a Griffin.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Jacob's sibling flying on a [[Griffin]]]]\nIt became apparent to Jacob's sibling that they might be having more than one secret admirers. When they and [[Andre Egwu|Andre]] were discussing their festival outfit, Andre expressed interest in this situation and decided to investigate the [[Case of the Secret Admirers|case]]. The next lesson was jointly conducted by [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] and [[Silvanus Kettleburn|Professor Kettleburn]], during which Jacob's sibling learned how to [[Flight|fly]] on a [[Griffin]]. Andre then discovered another secret admirer's note for them. They examined the evidences and Andre suggested there might have been a lot more than three admirers. Nevertheless, Jacob's sibling proceeded to finding Hagrid on the [[Hogwarts Quidditch pitch|Quidditch pitch]] to help with festival preparations, but spotted [[Murphy McNully|Murphy]] instead in the commentary box, who thought dating and [[Quidditch]] were alike. Back in the Courtyard with Andre, where their friends were all present, Jacob's sibling finally decided to ask a friend on a date. They invited them to [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]] and expressed their interest to them, who affirmed that the feelings were mutual.<ref name=\"FF\"/>\n\n[[File:Festival Fun dance.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Festival dance]]\nWhen Andre's outfits were ready, Jacob's sibling picked one from the two. They arrived at the main festival and found their date approaching them, also dressed stylishly. They checked out the activities at the festival, such as [[Puffskein]]-tossing and face-painting, which their date tried on them. Just then, Murphy announced the arrival of a special guest, [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], who returned since his last visit on [[Valentine's Day]] and gave a speech all about himself, before asking the dancing area to be cleared for him to have a [[duelling]] exhibition. Naturally, the students didn't want to relinquish the opportunity to dance, but Jacob's sibling volunteered for a duel with Lockhart on the [[Training Grounds]] to get him quickly out of there. Lockhart turned out to be quite weak after all, but he insisted on another duel after the first one, which made them and their date worry about having the dance on time. They then thought of a brilliant idea and turned the gobstone they had picked up into a skunk, which sprayed Lockhart and caused him to depart. The students were then able to return to the festival, and Jacob's sibling enjoyed a dance with their date. Near the end, the two were announced to have been elected as festival ambassadors, and they took off around the pitch together on a broom, when Jacob's sibling received a kiss.<ref name=\"FF\"/>\n\n=====Learning about Duncan and Jacob=====\nPenny invited Jacob's sibling to talk to the [[Fat Friar]], who suggested they go ask [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly Headless Nick]]. They met him along with [[William Weasley|Bill]], [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] and [[Percy Weasley]] (who brought [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]]) in [[Jacob's room]]. Nick told them Jacob had indeed possessed the Map, but they instead found a letter from Jacob about him bringing the Map to [[Olivia Green]], who had been in [[Ravenclaw]]. Jacob's sibling then met the [[Helena Ravenclaw|Grey Lady]] with [[Tulip Karasu|Tulip]], [[Talbott Winger|Talbott]] and [[Andre Egwu|Andre]], and found out from her that Jacob and Olivia had had another friend, [[Duncan Ashe]], who had been in [[Slytherin]]. They spoke to the [[Bloody Baron]] with Merula, [[Ismelda Murk|Ismelda]], [[Barnaby Lee|Barnaby]] and [[Liz Tuttle|Liz]], who revealed that Duncan was now a [[ghost]] and was the friend of Peeves.<ref name=\"HM56\">{{HM|5|6}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling, Bill and Charlie found Duncan in the [[Prefects' Bathroom]], who was, as expected, not friendly towards Jacob's sibling. He accused Jacob of ruining his life and told Jacob's sibling to go find out what had happened themselves.<ref name=\"HM56\"/>\n\nFrom [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] and [[Bilton Bilmes]], Jacob's sibling learned that [[Duncan Ashe|Duncan]] had borrowed a new broom after his had been destroyed, and that he had been a great mischief maker who would deconstruct things and put them back together. Jacob's sibling, [[Tulip Karasu|Tulip]] and [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] went to [[Jacob's room]] and found a letter from [[R]] to [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]], which suggested Jacob and his friends had been working for R and mentioned [[rat]]s and [[Centaur]]s.<ref name=\"HM57\">{{HM|5|7}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling and [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] then went to the [[Forest Grove]] to meet [[Torvus]], who was surprised to know that Duncan was dead. Torvus told them that Jacob and Duncan had planned to enter the [[Forest Vault]] and Duncan had worked on an extra-powerful [[Erumpent Potion]]. Duncan had wanted them to stick together, but Jacob had wanted to split up, resulting in the potion exploding, which had killed Duncan. They went back to the [[Prefects' Bathroom]] and met Duncan, only to find that Jacob and Duncan hadn't wanted to work with R at all, but R had manipulated Duncan into brewing an extra-explosive Erumpent Potion. Duncan blamed Jacob because he had let himself get expelled because of R, and claimed that Jacob was now a member of R and a feared wizard in [[Knockturn Alley]]. Jacob's sibling asked about the [[Marauder's Map]], which, according to Duncan, had been given away by [[Peeves]]. Duncan said [[Mundungus Fletcher]] could help them and tell more about Jacob.<ref name=\"HM57\"/>\n\n=====The All-Wizard Tournament=====\nOn the [[Care of Magical Creatures]] grounds, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] and [[Silvanus Kettleburn|Professor Kettleburn]] announced, to a group of selected students including Jacob's sibling, their plan of hosting an original [[All-Wizard Tournament]], which would help them prepare for a potentially upcoming [[Triwizard Tournament]]. Jacob's sibling was further motivated to participate when Hagrid explained that the final [[Cursed Vaults]] could hold similar danger, and their friends were excited about it as well. They spent some time learning about the Triwizard Tournament and its cancellation in the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]], where Hagrid disclosed the first task would involve [[Niffler]]s.<ref name=\"AWV\"/>\n\nThe first task took place in the [[History of Magic Classroom]], was worth 100 points and was about finding as much shiny objects as possible using Nifflers. Due to its simplicity, it didn't receive much positive feedback, but Hagrid and Kettleburn promised the second task would be more challenging, and after announcing the winner, who was Jacob's sibling, they explained that the hints to the second task were hidden inside the contestants' shiny objects. Jacob's sibling met [[Jae Kim|Jae]] and [[Andre Egwu|Andre]] in the [[Classroom 1B|Transfiguration Classroom]] and [[Untransfiguration|Untransfigured]] a shiny object into a jar of unidentified matter. After some examination, [[Liz Tuttle|Liz]] indicated the matter were [[Doxy egg]]s.<ref name=\"AWV\"/>\n\nThe second task took place on the [[Training Grounds]], was worth 300 points and involved catching a [[Pixie]] on a [[Broomstick|broom]], which had been cast the [[Hurling Hex]]. When Jacob's sibling was about to catch the Pixie, [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] bumped them, which led to [[Andre Egwu|Andre]] taking the lead and catching the Pixie, but not before a mass of [[Doxy|Doxies]] escaped their cages and created chaos, injuring several students who were taken to the [[Hospital Wing]] imminently. Hagrid and Kettleburn were no longer confident that continuing the tournament was a good move, and they, Jacob's sibling and several others talked to [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], who didn't intend to cancel the tournament but was determined to oversee the third task, and said the clue to it would find them.<ref name=\"AWV\"/>\n\nAt night, Jacob's sibling met a couple of students gathered by [[Badeea Ali|Badeea]], who couldn't sleep due to the tournament. Andre and Merula decided to practise spells, and Jacob's sibling and the others talked about the upcoming task, but no one really felt better. A Niffler left them a coin, which was Untransfigured into a [[Howler]] playing their friends' voices saying they were trapped by a [[Manticore]] in the [[Forbidden Forest]]. Arriving in the [[Forest Grove]], they shot spells towards the Manticore but it didn't work due to its resistance to all [[charm]]s, and Jacob's sibling saved Merula's life by pushing her out of its tail's reach. They collected their wits and formed a plan of blasting the tree branch on top of the Manticore and knocking it unconscious, which turned out to be successful. Hagrid, Kettleburn and Dumbledore then came out of the trees behind which they were monitoring the students, and congratulated them for finishing the final task.<ref name=\"AWV\"/>\n\nThey gathered in the [[Great Hall]] once more and listened to Dumbledore, who declared there had been a winner of the final task despite it being completed by collaborative efforts, and that the winner was Jacob's sibling for recognising the solution to be working together and convincing their competition of it. Another 500 points were awarded to them, who stepped up and accepted the [[All-Wizard Cup]] as the final victor of the tournament.<ref name=\"AWV\"/>\n\n=====Preparing for Knockturn Alley=====\n[[Jae Kim|Jae]] suggested using [[Floo Network]] to go to [[Knockturn Alley]] to meet [[Mundungus Fletcher]]. Remembering [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]] had used it last school year, they went to [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class, demonstrated defeating a [[Boggart]], and asked Rakepick to teach them. Rakepick knew their true purpose, so she gathered all her apprentices to train their duelling techniques, gave Jacob's sibling a private lesson on instinctive reaction, and even sent them to the [[Forest Grove]] to face [[Silvanus Kettleburn|Kettleburn]]'s [[Silvanus Kettleburn's Chimaera|lost Chimaera]]. [[Liz Tuttle]] appeared in time and comforted the Chimaera with red meat, saving both of them.<ref name=\"HM58\">{{HM|5|8}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling returned to speak to Rakepick, who believed it would be better if they were accompanied by someone else. They invited a friend and learned the [[Stunning Spell]] from [[William Weasley|Bill]].<ref name=\"HM59\">{{HM|5|9}}</ref>\n\n=====The Valentine's Day Ball=====\n[[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] called another special assembly in the [[Great Hall]] and announced the upcoming [[Valentine's Day Ball]]. It surprised and disappointed Jacob's sibling and fellow students when he said to have put [[Irma Pince|Madam Pince]] in charge of it, who would see to the planning of the ball with \"utmost seriousness\". After growing some flowers in [[Herbology]] class using the [[Herbivicus Charm]], Jacob's sibling got the idea of bringing them to Pince for approval, but Pince was concerned that they would remind one of what they didn't have on a holiday and thus make one feel more alone. Jacob's sibling tried to explain to her the students' vision of the ball, but Pince was insistent that there be no floral arrangements and [[sugar]]y refreshments, and the only sounds she would like to hear that night were a lonely classical [[Piano|fortepiano]]. She also suggested Jacob's sibling take it up with the [[Headmaster]] if they had issues with her arrangements, which was exactly what they did, and they received some wise advice from Dumbledore.<ref name=\"VDB\">{{HM|5|VALENTINE'S DAY BALL}} - This event takes place after Chapter 9 of Year 5.</ref>\n\nThey invited [[Penny Haywood|Penny]] to speak to Pince with them, but she wasn't willing to change her mind. They then witnessed a friendly interaction between Pince and [[Argus Filch|Mr Filch]], who they believed to be her own valentine. They talked to [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] about their idea of using Filch to indirectly convince Pince, and Merula used the [[Colour Change Charm]] to play a prank on [[Mrs Norris]], which inevitably caught Filch's attention and he called Jacob's sibling to [[Room 234-00|his office]]. There, they reversed the colour change and pretended that Pince wanted sophisticated refreshments, refined music and elegant flowers for the ball. They even arranged with [[Andre Egwu|Andre]] to design a makeover for him, which he wore to a meeting with Pince, Jacob's sibling and [[Talbott Winger|Talbott]]. At the end of the meeting, she was finally convinced to organise a fairy tale Valentine's Day Ball.<ref name=\"VDB\"/>\n\nJacob's sibling chat with [[Chiara Lobosca|Chiara]] and [[Jae Kim|Jae]] about music and food for the ball respectively, and when Pince came down to the [[Hogwarts kitchens|Kitchens]] to look for Jacob's sibling, she tried Jae's fairy cakes and talked about her idea of putting up a mural in the hall. They then met with [[Badeea Ali|Badeea]], who agreed to paint one with them, and she also let them choose the type of story they would be telling with it. They also went to the forest in the [[Magical Creatures Reserve]] with [[Barnaby Lee|Barnaby]] and recruited their [[Fairy at the Magical Creatures Reserve|fairy friend]] and her own friends to provide light at the ball. Throughout this whole experience, every student Jacob's sibling had talked to had asked them, explicitly or implicitly, to be their date, and they had a hard time deciding who to choose. They talked to [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] in the [[Courtyard]] where all their friends gathered, and Jacob's sibling finally decided to ask one of them to be their date, who heartily agreed. They also put on an outfit Andre designed for them.<ref name=\"VDB\"/>\n\n[[File:Valentine's Day Ball surprise scene.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The surprise scene Jacob's sibling's date set up for them]]\nAt the ball, Jacob's sibling and their date met Pince and Filch, who thanked Jacob's sibling for their help. They had their first dance on the dance floor following the rhythm of the music played by the enchanted instruments set up by Badeea. After the dance, Dumbledore congratulated them for their efforts leading to an excellent ball, and pointed them to Pince and Filch who were sharing a romantic moment together. He also reminded them to go the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]] to meet their date, who had prepared a surprise scene for them and gave them a storybook symbolising the romance they had for each other.<ref name=\"VDB\"/>\n\n=====Visiting Knockturn Alley=====\nRakepick met them in [[Headmaster's Office|Dumbledore's office]] and used the [[Floo Powder]] on the fireplace before they stepped in it and were transported to [[Diagon Alley]], which was safer as a landing point.<ref name=\"HM510\">{{HM|5|10}}</ref>\n\nThey then went to Knockturn Alley and asked around about Fletcher. They found out from [[Jane Court]] that Fletcher had lost a duel recently and had been going to [[Ollivanders]], so they went there, but didn't find Fletcher. He had been there though to ask about the wand of [[White-robed wizard|his opponent]], whose approach and stance had been very unique. [[Garrick Ollivander|Ollivander]] had suggested Fletcher go to [[Villanelle|Madam Villanelle]], a linguist, in [[Flourish and Blotts]] to learn more about the way his opponent had shouted incantations.<ref name=\"HM510\"/>\n\nThey visited Villanelle, and while waiting for her to finish her business, they found a book that had a strange invisible message about a \"vault portrait\". Villanelle later told them that though she hadn't recognised anything from Fletcher's recollection of his opponent's incantations, he had told her that the wizard had been in white robes and had a tattoo of a skeletal snake or dragon, making her suggest him go to [[Borgin and Burkes]].<ref name=\"HM510\"/>\n\nBefore entering Borgin and Burkes, they encountered [[Dark Witch from Knockturn Alley|a witch]], who demanded something from them. She cast the [[Slug-vomiting Charm]] on Jacob's sibling's friend, and Jacob's sibling duelled her, only to attract more witches and wizards. At this moment, Rakepick appeared and defeated them. She then told them she had tracked down Fletcher and he was waiting in the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]].<ref name=\"HM510\"/>\n\nFletcher told them he had managed to get the Marauder's Map out of Hogwarts, but had been attacked and robbed by someone from behind. Before he would tell them more, he asked for some [[Venomous Tentacula]] Seeds, [[Acromantula venom|Acromantula Venom]] and [[Chimaera]] Eggs, which they got from the [[Herbology Classroom]], [[Aragog's Lair|Spider's Lair]] and [[Care of Magical Creatures]] grounds. Fletcher then recounted that the man who'd attacked him had transformed into something before running off and might have gotten the Map into Hogwarts by now, and suggested that this might have been the same person who had attacked Jacob's sibling at the start of the school year.<ref name=\"HM511\">{{HM|5|11}}</ref>\n\n=====Looking for the vault portrait=====\nAfter [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class, [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]] told Jacob's sibling there had been rumours of a [[Vault portrait|portrait of a]] [[Cursed Vaults|Cursed Vault]] hidden in Hogwarts. They met [[Badeea Ali|Badeea]] on the [[Grand Staircase]] and talked to other portraits but didn't get anything useful. Then they met their friends in the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]] and didn't find anything either. They met [[Jae Kim|Jae]] in the [[Hogwarts kitchens|Kitchens]] and talked to the [[Hogwarts house-elves|house-elves]], and from one of them, they learned that some [[Gryffindor]] students had asked an elf about the portrait years ago.<ref name=\"HM512\">{{HM|5|12}}</ref>\n\nThey went into the [[Gryffindor Common Room]] during [[Gryffindor vs Ravenclaw Quidditch match (1988\u20131989)|a Quidditch match]] with Jae to look for the portrait, but were discovered by [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], who was searching for [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]]. Percy accused them of using magic outside of class (though it was only the [[Wand-Lighting Charm]]), and was about to report them to everyone he could think of, when Jacob's sibling proposed to find Scabbers with him. They asked [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] for borrowing [[Fang]], which he agreed.<ref name=\"HM512\"/>\n\n=====Performing a play=====\nIn the [[Great Hall]], [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] recounted the performance of ''[[The Fountain of Fair Fortune]]'' at Hogwarts decades ago and the damage it did to the whole school, but said that [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] had convinced him to put up another play. Flitwick introduced to the audience his original play, ''[[Equinox Enchanted]]'', and an intimate scene in it in which the leads would express their love towards one another, which Jacob's sibling and their friends found to be a big undertaking. They talked to Flitwick himself, who further explained the plot details of the play and gave them advices on a successful audition. They helped each other prepare for it, and Jacob's sibling also learned some movement techniques from [[Diego Caplan|Diego]], the Choreographer and Assistant Director. During the audition, Jacob's sibling's partner, [[Barnaby Lee|Barnaby]], forgot his line, and the two of them went completely off the script, but Flitwick was very impressed with their improvisational skills. After Jacob's sibling helped [[Badeea Ali|Badeea]] with her artworks for the play, Flitwick announced that they had been chosen as a lead, along with the exact student Jacob's sibling wanted to co-star with.<ref name=\"AEK\">{{HM|5|AN ENCHANTED KISS}} - This event takes place after Chapter 12 of Year 5.</ref>\n\nBefore the first rehearsal, Flitwick brought up the superstition that saying the name of ''The Fountain of Fair Fortune'' during rehearsals would bring ill fortune, and while Jacob's sibling was doubtful about it, some of their friends, including Diego, was careful not to risk it. Later, Barnaby introduced to Jacob's sibling his pet [[Knarl]], [[Knarl (individual)|Knarl]], who Flitwick believed to be suitable for their partner during a dance scene with a magical creature. They tried to teach him some stage directions, but didn't have much luck except for the \"stay\" instruction. Flitwick then decided to change the script to include a duelling scene and reviewed it with Jacob's sibling and Diego in the [[Duelling Club]]. Jacob's sibling also helped [[Andre Egwu|Andre]] and [[Talbott Winger|Talbott]] search for costume sketches.<ref name=\"AEK\"/>\n\nDuring a conversation with Andre, Jacob's sibling became afraid of stage fright, so they asked [[Penny Haywood|Penny]] to brew some [[Calming Draught]]. They searched for ingredients in the [[Artefact Room]], but were still missing a [[crocodile heart]], which they had to ask [[Jae Kim|Jae]] to obtain, and surprisingly, Jae had a lot of collectibles from crocodiles including their hearts, so they started brewing immediately. The potion, however, looked unusually purple, and when Jacob's sibling drank some, they felt their mouth burning, which Jae thought was because of too much [[peppermint]] oil he had added. Fortunately, [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] restored them with a few waves of her wand, and in return, Jacob's sibling and Jae helped her tidy up [[Classroom 1B|her classroom]].<ref name=\"AEK\"/>\n\n[[File:Equinox Enchanted.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Jacob's sibling performing ''[[Equinox Enchanted]]'']]\nThe time of dress rehearsal came, but Barnaby had lost Knarl, so it took the crew some time to find him, and when they did, Barnaby accidentally uttered the words of ill fortune and yelled after realising his mistake, sending Knarl off in a fright while making a big mess on the stage. Flitwick was shocked when all the decorations had been ruined and he cancelled the show immediately. Jacob's sibling wouldn't admit defeat and gathered their friends in the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]], and they planned to put up the play there, but due to the confined space and limited resources, it had to be adapted to a one-wizard play. Flitwick was on board with this plan, and soon Andre finished Jacob's sibling's costume for the Spring Nymph. Later in the Inn, they took the stage and completed the performance to the resounding applause from the audience. Their original co-star met with them alone in the Great Hall after the show and shared the romantic scene with them like it should've been.<ref name=\"AEK\"/>\n\n=====Various findings=====\nJacob's sibling, Jae and Fang went to the [[Forest Grove]] and searched for Scabbers together with [[Torvus]]. They found some rat tracks which led to human shoeprints. They found some sandwich crumbs in the [[Prefects' Bathroom]] with [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]]. Following the cue, they searched the Kitchens, where Fang found some [[Fairy wings]], and the [[Care of Magical Creatures]] grounds, where Fang found some [[cursed ice]], and the [[Icy Corridor]], where Fang found some animal fur, and the [[Cursed Corridor]], where they found Scabbers at last with an old parchment.<ref name=\"HM513\">{{HM|5|13}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling returned Fang to Hagrid and Scabbers to Percy. They discussed Scabbers with friends, during which [[Ben Copper|Ben]] mentioned finding Scabbers in the [[Artefact Room]] once, and despite Percy's defence, the rest still found him suspicious. Ben later told Jacob's sibling he believed Scabbers had been following him and might have also been responsible for his memory loss. Jacob's sibling presented the parchment to Rakepick, who told them it was the [[Marauder's Map]].<ref name=\"HM514\">{{HM|5|14}}</ref>\n\n=====Hunting for a Crumple-Horned Snorkack=====\nWhile Jacob's sibling was having a drink with [[Barnaby Lee|Barnaby]] and [[Chiara Lobosca|Chiara]] in the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]], an interesting-looking wizard walked in and sat on a table who claimed to be in desperate need of someone for an extraordinary adventure. They recognised him as [[Xenophilius Lovegood]], the publisher of ''[[The Quibbler]]'', and he stood up on the table and said he was seeking journalists to provide photographic evidence of the existence of [[Crumple-Horned Snorkack]]s, which he have heard reports to have been spotted near Hogwarts. Barnaby and Chiara disagreed over whether it was real, but Jacob's sibling thought it would be an interesting opportunity if it did exist and they could take a picture of it, which would be placed on the front cover of the next issue. After some discussion, Chiara thought the reward money could be a big deal to her, and they agreed to try searching for it.<ref name=\"Quibbler\">{{HM|5|THE QUIBBLER: FIGHT FOR THE FRONT PAGE}} - This event takes place after Chapter 14 of Year 5.</ref>\n\nChiara taught Jacob's sibling a [[tracking spell]] and Jacob's sibling tracked down a [[niffler]] for practice. They then tried searching for a Crumple-Horned Snorkack in [[Hagrid's Garden]], but found Barnaby with his camera, who was trying to snap a photo of a [[Moon Frog]], which he thought Xenophilius might accept as well. The three went back to Three Broomsticks and tried to convince Xenophilius, and he agreed to take a photo of a Moon Frog if Crumple-Horned Snorkacks couldn't be found. Afterwards, [[Ismelda Murk|Ismelda]] confronted them and said she was up to something big.<ref name=\"Quibbler\"/>\n\nBarnaby took Jacob's sibling to the forest in the [[Magical Creatures Reserve]] and said this had been where he had first seen the Moon Frog. After retracing his footsteps, Barnaby thought he had an idea of where the Moon Frog could be, and when he went off to find out, Jacob's sibling met with Chiara, who divulged that the \"school supplies\" she had been meaning to get from the reward money was actually for preventing losing control during her next [[Werewolf|transformation]]. When Jacob's sibling and Chiara talked to Ismelda, they were surprised to hear that Ismelda wasn't looking for a Crumple-Horned Snorkack at all, but instead was after something \"definitely real\".<ref name=\"Quibbler\"/>\n\nAt night, Jacob's sibling followed Ismelda and [[Ismelda Murk's friends#Gryffindor girl and Ravenclaw boy|her friends]] to Hagrid's garden and overheard them talking about capturing a [[werewolf]] before it transformed and exposing [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] for harbouring a werewolf at Hogwarts. Terrible still, Ismelda was already suspecting Chiara, so Jacob's sibling decided to warn Chiara before she came, but Chiara then appeared, and when they prepared to use the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] on Chiara, Jacob's sibling used the [[Knockback Jinx]] on her first, knocking her out of the curse's way. Chiara got away in time and Ismelda was determined to seek another chance.<ref name=\"Quibbler\"/>\n\nWhen Jacob's sibling spoke with Chiara again in the [[Courtyard]], Chiara thanked them for saving her from the gang's curses, and when Jacob's sibling told her about Ismelda's intent, she was worried, so they played [[Wizard's Chess]] together to help them think the situation through. They came up with the idea of making Ismelda think it was a hoax, and Jacob's sibling talked to Barnaby, who suggested asking [[Tulip Karasu|Tulip]] and [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] for help. They formed a plan involving Barnaby telling Ismelda he had seen a werewolf near Hagrid's Garden and Tonks and Tulip wearing a werewolf disguise.<ref name=\"Quibbler\"/>\n\nJacob's sibling then checked on Chiara, who was searching for ingredients for the [[Wolfsbane Potion]] in the [[Potions Classroom]]. They helped her, but didn't find any. When the time of executing the plan came, Jacob's sibling went down to Hagrid's Garden and saw the completed werewolf custome made by Tulip and Tonks. Jacob's sibling greeted Ismelda when she arrived, and pretended to search with her for the creature Barnaby'd told her that he'd spotted. Jacob's sibling pointed to a [[pumpkin]], behind which Tulip and Tonks in the werewolf custome emerged and scared the life out of Ismelda, who asked Jacob's sibling for help. Tulip and Tonks then took off the custome, and Jacob's sibling faked their surprise towards them.<ref name=\"Quibbler\"/>\n\nThe next day, Jacob's sibling and Chiara went to the [[Great Lake]] to meet with Barnaby and search for the Moon Frog. After a while, Barnaby came and claimed he had seen it, but had lost it again. Jacob's sibling then used the tracking spell to reveal the tracks of the Moon Frog, and the three eventually found it following the trace. Barnaby took a picture of it with his camera, and when Jacob's sibling noticed [[Glow Bug]]s flying above it, Barnaby said it looked familiar to him. Jacob's sibling realised it looked like [[Sir Ribbithe]], which [[Liz Tuttle|Liz]] was said to have been finding, and that the glow was because of him feasting on the Glow Bugs.<ref name=\"Quibbler\"/>\n\nAlthough it wasn't a real Moon Frog, when Jacob's sibling looked at the photo, he discovered a [[Caelan|Quintaped]], a very rare creature, in the background. They went back to Three Broomsticks and negotiated with Xenophilius, who decided to put the photo on the front page because of it. The students enjoyed some [[Butterbeer]] together, and when Jacob's sibling asked Tonks whether the Quintaped had been her in disguise again, she neither confirmed nor denied it.<ref name=\"Quibbler\"/>\n\n=====Following the Marauder's Map=====\nAt night, [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]] explained to Jacob's sibling all about the [[Marauder's Map]]. It was her belief that the Map would show them the location of [[White-robed wizard|the man who attacked]] [[Mundungus Fletcher]] who would have the [[Vault Portrait]], the key to the [[Buried Vault|next Cursed Vault]]. They opened the Map and saw a person moving very fast, but before Jacob's sibling could see their name, Rakepick pocketed the Map. They did, however, see that person's locations.<ref name=\"HM515\">{{HM|5|15}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling searched the [[Classroom 3C|Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom]] with [[Barnaby Lee|Barnaby]], only to find a [[Black Quill (R's)|black quill]] on Rakepick's desk, which couldn't be [[Untransfiguration|Untransfigured]]. They then searched [[Room 234-00|Filch's office]] with [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], and found some negative reports on Rakepick. They went on to search [[Jacob's room]] with [[Tulip Karasu|Tulip]] and [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] and found another black quill, which Jacob's sibling Untransfigured into another [[Jacob's notebooks|Jacob's notebook]], which recorded [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]]'s collaboration with Rakepick, Rakepick's fear of [[R|the Cabal]], and that she had saved Jacob's sibling's life years ago.<ref name=\"HM515\"/>\n\nJacob's sibling talked to Rakepick, who denied everything written on the notebook. Realising that Rakepick only respected strength, they met [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] and practised spells. Merula thought this wasn't enough, and invited them to duel with [[Diego Caplan]], her duelling instructor, which they did before facing Rakepick herself. Rakepick was still reluctant to divulge anything, but Jacob's sibling wouldn't compromise. They prepared to duel her, but she made the first move and broke [[Jacob's sibling's first wand|their wand]].<ref name=\"HM516\">{{HM|5|16}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling and Rakepick then went to [[Ollivanders]] to purchase [[Jacob's sibling's second wand|another wand]]. They met [[Mundungus Fletcher|Fletcher]] once more in [[Knockturn Alley]], who admitted he hadn't been attacked, but instead had sold the map to an unknown buyer by leaving it outside of [[Hog's Head Inn]] for them to pick up. Jacob's sibling went to Hog's Head and met [[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]], who hated Fletcher and wouldn't talk about him, but gave them a letter from [[Albus Dumbledore|Albus]]. They then went to ask Albus, who revealed they were a [[Legilimency|Legilimens]] like their brother, and that [[Severus Snape|Snape]] would teach them both [[Legilimency]] and [[Occlumency]].<ref name=\"HM517\">{{HM|5|17}}</ref>\n\n=====Learning Legilimency and Occlumency=====\n[[File:Private Lessons between Jacob's sibling and Severus Snape.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Jacob's sibling and [[Severus Snape]] discussing [[Legilimency]] and [[Occlumency]]]]\n[[Severus Snape|Snape]] started [[Jacob's sibling and Severus Snape's private lessons|their lessons]] by [[Legilimency|breaking into their minds]] (seeing Jacob's sibling's times with [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|their brother]]) and teaching them this ability. When Snape asked Jacob's sibling to look into his mind, he also used [[Occlumency]] to prevent them from doing this.<ref name=\"HM518\">{{HM|5|18}}</ref>\n\nThen he asked them to practise Legilimency elsewhere, so they used it on [[Argus Filch|Filch]], [[Rosmerta]], [[Pitts]] and [[Barnaby Lee|Barnaby]]. They found out from Rosmerta that she had once hidden Jacob from the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. When they used it on [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]], she also used Occlumency to deny their access.<ref name=\"HM518\"/>\n\nThey returned to meet Snape and practised Occlumency themselves. They hadn't perfected the skill by the time Snape used Legilimency on them again, but they were improving. When they asked why he was teaching them these, Snape answered that he would rather have liked to see them being a weapon against Rakepick than a pawn of hers. He then reminded them about the [[Garrotting Gas]] he had given them and mentioned that Rakepick would inevitably turn on them.<ref name=\"HM518\"/>\n\n=====The Great Hogwarts Cook-Off=====\nWith Madams [[Mary Karasu|Mary]] and [[Rosa Karasu]] visiting Hogwarts, a cook-off was to be held, inviting students to sign up for the competition, of which Mary and Rosa would be the judges. As they are [[Tulip Karasu|Tulip]]'s grans, she introduced them to Jacob's sibling personally, who was greeted affectionately by them. Tulip also asked for Jacob's sibling's help to co-organise the cook-off. The two discussed the event with Mary and Rosa and decided to recruit [[Badeea Ali|Badeea]] as a contestant. Badeea wanted to cook a [[fish stew]], and after bartering a box of [[EaziKleen Self-Propelling Scourers]] with [[Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]], [[Jae Kim|Jae]] successfully got them a fresh and delicious fish.<ref name=\"TGHC\">{{HM|5|THE GREAT HOGWARTS COOK-OFF}} - This event takes place after Chapter 18 of Year 5.</ref>\n\nThe next candidate on the list was [[Diego Caplan|Diego]], who was willing to bake an enchanted dancing [[flan]]. They consulted [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] about what spell to use, and were taught the [[Locomotion Charm]]. Meanwhile, Tulip recruited [[Ismelda Murk|Ismelda]] and Jae, who were cooking a [[meat pie]] with [[blood sausage]]s and a [[tteokbokki]] respectively. They talked when [[Andre Egwu|Andre]] was designing some chef's robes, and alighted on the idea of inviting [[Murphy McNully|Murphy]] to be the host, who agreed and named the event the \"[[Great Hogwarts Cook-Off]]\".<ref name=\"TGHC\"/>\n\n[[File:Great Hogwarts Cook-Off.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The [[Great Hogwarts Cook-Off]]]]\nThe cook-off was held in the [[Hogwarts kitchens|Kitchens]], during which the four contestant prepared their dishes while Murphy commentated. At the end, Mary and Rosa provided some critical insights towards each dish, but Ismelda was angered by her dough being called \"sad and soggy\" and transformed her pie into a [[Dough Creature|monster]], which destroyed Diego's flan. Jacob's sibling was quick to cast the [[Eradication Spell]] to wipe the monster out of existence, but even then, the cook-off had become a disaster. Tulip became very upset and left the scene, and though Jacob's sibling managed to cheer her up, the situation between Ismelda and Diego was more than intense. Jacob's sibling visited the two of them respectively and helped both of them with their affairs, and when Diego insisted on duelling to resolve the conflict, Jacob's sibling volunteered to duel him on behalf of Ismelda, effectively acting as her champion. After the duel, Diego and Ismelda reconciliated, and all of them went back to salvaging the cook-off.<ref name=\"TGHC\"/>\n\n[[File:Great Hogwarts Cook-Off feast 1.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The opening of the feast]]\nThey gathered all the contestants and worked on improving their recipes. After they talked about what they loved about the dishes they chose, Jacob's sibling realised they could all make a progress by sharing their ingredients. The Madams Karasu were intrigued by the idea of collaboration, and heartily agreed to it. After the dishes were completed, students gathered in the [[Great Hall]] to have a feast, before Jacob's sibling was commended by the judges and the faculty for demonstrating the event's true spirit and upholding Hogwarts's ideals of community, collaboration and friendship.<ref name=\"TGHC\"/>\n\n=====Rowan possessed=====\n[[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] called them in and asked them to use Legilimency on him to find out the answers they were looking for. Later, just as Jacob's sibling were catching up with their friends, [[Rowan]] seemed to be possessed and acted like the [[R's second messenger|unidentified cloaked figure]]. They attacked one of them, but was knocked unconscious by [[Ben Copper|Ben]]. In the [[Hospital Wing]], [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] examined Rowan and believed they had been under the [[Imperius Curse]]. Since one had to be near their target to cast the curse, Jacob's sibling recounted their surroundings, and together with Rakepick, they found [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] to be suspicious.<ref name=\"HM519\">{{HM|5|19}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Knockturn Alley]], Jacob's sibling and Rakepick continued their conversation. Rakepick had spoken to Percy, and though she didn't think Percy had the ability to cast the Imperius Curse, her instincts told her he was somehow intimately involved. Rakepick wanted to teach Jacob's sibling the [[Cruciatus Curse]], but they didn't want to learn an [[Unforgivable Curses|Unforgivable Curse]] like it. She then demonstrated on a nearby dark wizard, who immediately screamed in pain. Witnessing this didn't change Jacob's sibling's mind, but Rakepick still believed it would be useful under certain circumstances.<ref name=\"HM519\"/>\n\n=====Forming a grand plan=====\nWhen Jacob's sibling was back at Hogwarts, [[Slytherin boy who drank a botched potion|another student]] had been trapped in a portrait. They talked to other portraits, and following the clues they gave, they searched the [[Classroom 3C|Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom]] with [[Badeea Ali|Badeea]], and found a letter from [[Silvanus Kettleburn|Kettleburn]]. He had told [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]] to purchase [[cat]]s because the castle had a rat problem mainly in the upstairs corridors. They used the [[Revelio Charm]] there, and revealed Scabbers, who immediately transformed into his human form, [[Peter Pettigrew]]. The two duelled and Pettigrew was forced to tell them that Rakepick had stolen the [[Marauder's Map|Map]] and the [[vault portrait]] was actually a [[Portkey]] which now belonged to [[Peeves]], but before finishing, he [[Memory Charm|wiped]] Jacob's sibling's memory of this conversation. Rakepick, however, had arrived and heard the part of the portrait and Peeves.<ref name=\"HM520\">{{HM|5|20}}</ref>\n\nRakepick gathered Jacob's sibling, [[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] to talk about their plan of retrieving the portrait, and they decided to ask the House ghosts for help. During a [[Hufflepuff vs Slytherin Quidditch match (1988\u20131989)|Quidditch match between Hufflepuff and Slytherin]], [[Diego Caplan|Diego]] led Jacob's sibling and another student to the [[Hufflepuff Common Room]] to consult the [[Fat Friar]], but didn't receive much advice. They then went to the [[Slytherin Common Room]] and talked to [[Bloody Baron]], who was reluctant to provide help. In the [[Gryffindor Common Room]], [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly Headless Nick]] generously offered some tactics. The [[Helena Ravenclaw|Grey Lady]] in the [[Ravenclaw Common Room]], on the other hand, only talked to them so that they could leave early. At the end of their conversation, she said the House ghosts couldn't help them, leading Jacob's sibling to think that maybe [[Cuthbert Binns|Professor Binns]] had certain ways around Peeves.<ref name=\"HM521\">{{HM|5|21}}</ref>\n\nThey visited Binns, who still attempted to give them a lecture on the [[Goblin Rebellion of 1612]]. After learning their true motives, he tried to talk about Peeves, but only rounded back to the [[Goblin Rebellions]]. They then paid another visit to [[Duncan Ashe]], who wanted Jacob's sibling to talk about their curse-breaking adventures first. Duncan, after satisfied with their stories, promised to set up a meeting with Peeves for them. He also mentioned that they need to do something big, in other words, cause chaos, to get his attention.<ref name=\"HM521\"/>\n\nJacob's sibling met Duncan in the [[Courtyard]] and he said Peeves would want them to cast [[Lacarnum Inflamari]] on [[Severus Snape|Snape]] or [[Argus Filch|Filch]]. Duncan distracted them and Jacob's sibling cast the spell on one of them. Peeves then showed up, but only wanted some more chaos. They went to the [[Grand Staircase]] to annoy [[Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]] by crediting his defeat of [[Wyvern of Wye]] to [[Merlin]], battled [[Silvanus Kettleburn's Chimaera|Kettleburn's Chimaera]] on the [[Training Grounds]], started a food fight in the [[Hogwarts kitchens|Kitchens]], and tossed some [[Frog Spawn Soap]] into the bathtub in the [[Prefects' Bathroom]], where [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] was having a bath. After having seen all these, Peeves gave them [[Peeves's self-portrait|a portrait of himself]], which Jacob's sibling rejected naturally. When asked what would it take to hand out the vault portrait, Peeves said a masterpiece of pranks was needed for a masterpiece of portrait.<ref name=\"HM522\">{{HM|5|22}}</ref>\n\n[[Penny Haywood|Penny]] helped Jacob's sibling brew some [[Wit-Sharpening Potion]] and shared it while brainstorming with [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], [[Tulip Karasu|Tulip]] and [[Jae Kim|Jae]]. Tonks inadvertently inspired Jacob's sibling to invent their own spell, and they immediately talked to Badeea and found out she had already invented the [[Star Shower Spell]], which they thought would be the perfect choice. The spell, however, wasn't working as she expected, so Jacob's sibling researched in the [[Restricted Section]] with [[Rowan Khanna|Rowan]], but didn't find anything useful. Deciding that [[Dark Arts|Dark magic]] would probably not help with the Star Shower Spell, they went to [[Filius Flitwick|Flitwick]] with Bill and Snape with Merula, and from Snape they learned the incantation they had been using, ''Stella Corusco'', was wrong and would only make the stars shimmer instead of shower. After falling victim to Jacob's sibling's prank while bathing, Charlie decided to take showers more often, so Jacob's sibling asked him to describe showers to them, during which he mentioned the word \"cascade\". They reflected on it and eventually came up with ''Stella Cascadia'' which turned out to be the correct incantation.<ref name=\"HM523\">{{HM|5|23}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the spell is ready, they still needed something that would get everyone outside to see it in action. In [[Hog's Head Inn]], [[Bilton Bilmes]] suggested a banned prank, which sounded like something Jae could get. Jae thought of the [[jinx]]ed version of [[Ever-Bashing Boomerang]]s which would whiz super fast, but only [[Mundungus Fletcher]] had it. They met Fletcher in [[Three Broomsticks Inn]], and he asked them to duel [[Dark Wizard in Knockturn Alley|a dark wizard]] who, according to him, had cheated him. They met the dark wizard in [[Knockturn Alley]], who started duelling them instantly. After the duel, he threatened to crush Fletcher if he stole from him again. Fletcher then sent them the jinxed Ever-Bashing Boomerangs as promised.<ref name=\"HM524\">{{HM|5|24}}</ref>\n\n=====Taking O.W.L.s=====\n{{Expand}}\nJacob's sibling took [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]].<ref name=\"OWL\"/>\n\n=====Releasing ultimate chaos=====\nDuring a [[Care of Magical Creatures]] class, Jacob's sibling and their friends brainstormed ideas, and [[Liz Tuttle|Liz]] came up with the [[Troll]]. To train for subduing a Troll, Jacob's sibling duelled [[Diego Caplan|Diego]] and visited [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] to learn more about Trolls. After learning that any meat would lure Trolls, they went down to the Kitchens and distracted Pitts with a better work ethic while Liz raided the food stores. They also convinced a friend to duel the Troll together and made their outfit more \"chaotic\".<ref name=\"HM525\">{{HM|5|25}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SkirmishOnTheTrainingGrounds.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Jacob's sibling and their friend subduing the Troll]]\nWith everything prepared, Jacob's sibling, Bill and Charlie went to the Prefects' Bathroom and invited Peeves to witness the mischief masterpiece. Jacob's sibling, Tulip, Tonks and Jae [[Release of jinxed Ever-Bashing Boomerangs|released]] the enchanted Ever-Bashing Boomerangs in the [[Great Hall]], and they started to fly everywhere instead of flying back to them as expected. The Boomerangs drove nearly everyone out of the Hall before Jacob's sibling used the [[Freezing Charm]] to stop them flying. Just then, they heard screams from the [[Training Grounds]] caused by [[Troll at the Training Grounds|the Troll]], so they quickly arrived and [[Skirmish at the Training Grounds|subdued it]] while Peeves watched. Hagrid then came, disappointed by them, and decided to take care of the Troll.<ref name=\"HM526\">{{HM|5|26}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling then cast the Star Shower Spell with Badeea in the [[Courtyard]], which caused a real [[Star Shower in the Courtyard|Star Shower]] during which meteorites bashed towards the ground. Peeves was satisfied and told them the vault portrait was in [[Peeves' Room|his room]], which they entered and got the portrait. In the Kitchens, after Jae suggested showing it to Rakepick, [[Argus Filch|Filch]] arrived and questioned them about the banned Boomerangs. Before their conversation ended, Pitts ordered Filch to leave for bringing [[Mrs Norris]] to the Kitchens. He later explained that he did this because Dumbledore asked him to take care of Jacob's sibling, and that he wanted to see them free Beatrice because of his gratefulness towards [[Helga Hufflepuff]] for letting house-elves work in the Kitchens, before announcing their detention was over, but Jae's was not. He then gave Jacob's sibling a piece of meat as a farewell gift.<ref name=\"HM526\"/>\n\n=====Preparing for the Buried Vault=====\nJacob's sibling presented the [[vault portrait]] to [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]] who immediately told them they would be facing a [[dragon]] according to nothing, and took it away. They talked to [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]], [[Cuthbert Binns|Professor Binns]] and [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] and learned some information about how to defend against dragons. Rakepick then called them in with [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] and [[William Weasley|Bill]] and taught them the [[Conjunctivitis Curse]]. They visited [[Silvanus Kettleburn|Kettleburn]] too, who had seen dragons up close.<ref name=\"HM527\">{{HM|5|27}}</ref>\n\nMerula invited Jacob's sibling to the [[Hog's Head Inn]] and brought a notebook to ask them about the [[Cursed Vaults]]. After some discussion, Jacob's sibling pitched a training plan for her and she agreed to carry on with it. They first met in the [[Cursed Corridor]] to search for a potential hidden entrance to no avail. They then decided to bring [[Diego Caplan|Diego]] and head to the [[Forest Grove]] to duel [[Torvus]], who by then had already been accepted back to the [[Centaur Camp]]. Merula didn't win against Torvus, so he suggested Jacob's sibling and Merula team up against him. Merula wasn't ready to do this, so they headed back to Hogwarts and engaged in a spellcasting competition. Bill, as the judge, declared both of them as winners to Merula's disappointment.<ref name=\"HM528\">{{HM|5|28}}</ref>\n\nMerula borrowed the [[Classroom 3C|Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom]] from Rakepick and attempted to teach Jacob's sibling the [[Killing Curse]]. They then brought the subject of Rakepick trying to teach them the [[Cruciatus Curse]] up, about which Merula insisted them talk more. During the conversation, Merula said her parents had taught her the Killing Curse before they'd gone to [[Azkaban]]. She also tried demonstrating [[Fiendfyre]], but the spell went wrong and they couldn't turn it down. Fortunately, Rakepick arrived and extinguished the fire. At lunch, Merula told Jacob's sibling how she had discovered her parents had been [[Death Eaters]] and she was now looked after by [[Merula Snyde's aunt|her aunt]] during holidays.<ref name=\"HM528\"/>\n\nJacob's sibling convinced a friend to go into the [[Buried Vault]] with them in Hog's Head, but as soon as they left, [[Ben Copper|Ben]] came up and volunteered to do the same. Rakepick arranged a private lecture on [[Portkey]]s for Jacob's sibling, Bill, Merula and Ben (who would all be entering the Vault) and explained that the [[vault portrait]] should be a Portkey that would travel that night. They then deducted that the Vault had no entrance due to the designed way of entering, and soon Ben realised there could have no exit too. Rakepick later spoke with Jacob's sibling, telling them that they should take the lead should she die.<ref name=\"HM529\">{{HM|5|29}}</ref>\n\n=====Entering the Buried Vault=====\n[[Merula Snyde|Merula]], [[William Weasley|Bill]], [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]], Jacob's sibling and their friend (possibly [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] or [[Penny Haywood|Penny]]) waited for [[Ben Copper|Ben]] on the [[Training Grounds]], who, upon arrival, said he had been writing an important letter to an important wizard. After some preparation, they grasped the [[vault portrait]] together and was [[Infiltration of the Buried Vault (1989)|transported]] to the room connecting to the [[Buried Vault]].<ref name=\"HM530\">{{HM|5|30}}</ref>\n\n[[File:BuriedVault-HungarianHorntail.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Buried Vault Hungarian Horntail|The Hungarian Horntail]] in the [[Buried Vault]]]]\nIt appeared to be a deserted underground room with furniture and a massive portrait wall. Broken shackles and blood indicated there had been a dragon at some point, but now none was to be seen. They searched the Vault and when Jacob's sibling wanted to try opening a door on the portrait wall, Rakepick refused to let them, so their friend went up and used the [[Unlocking Charm]], but it didn't work. Ben simply knocked on the door and [[Buried Vault Hungarian Horntail|a Hungarian Horntail]] appeared and stepped out of the portraits. The Vault started to collapse, and while Rakepick cast the [[Slowing Charm]] on the falling rocks, Jacob's sibling used the [[Conjunctivitis Curse]] on the Horntail, thwarting several of its attempts to attack and leading to their victory.<ref name=\"HM530\"/>\n\n[[File:BuriedVault-Rakepick.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Patricia Rakepick]] turning on Jacob's sibling and their friends]]\nThe door on the portraits still wouldn't open, and Jacob's sibling was used [[Legilimency]] by, according to Rakepick, the door. They tried to do the same to the door and successfully opened it. Suddenly, Rakepick knocked them down and said she had once [[Infiltration of the Buried Vault (I)|attempted to enter]] the Vault with [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] and [[Peter Pettigrew]], who had fled out of the Vault with the portrait after seeing the Horntail, leaving her and Jacob to die. It turned out that she was only using Jacob's sibling for the Vault (because only Legilimens could open the door) and the rest of the students for dragon bait. The portrait curse hadn't been broken, Jacob had been trapped in a portrait that was beyond the door, and Rakepick had been transported to the [[Forbidden Forest]] when she had tried to acquire the treasure inside the centre column of the Vault.<ref name=\"HM530\"/>\n\nMerula attempted to stop Rakepick from killing all of them, but Rakepick used the [[Cruciatus Curse]] on her in advance. Jacob's sibling and their friends cast several spells, but were all deflected by the [[Shield Charm]]. Rakepick said she was under orders (from [[R]]) to kill one of Jacob's sibling's friends, but before she had her way, Jacob's sibling thought of the [[Garrotting Gas]] and released it, suffocating Rakepick and making her [[Apparition|Disapparate]].<ref name=\"HM530\"/>\n\n[[File:BuriedVault-CentreColumn.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Jacob's sibling opening the centre column in the Vault]]\nThey went into the Vault and found Jacob in a portrait, who asked them to touch the centre column. After Jacob was released, they had a brief reunion and Jacob's sibling told him how they had come. Upon hearing Rakepick had been here, Jacob wanted to stop her and Disapparated too. Jacob's sibling opened the column and found a [[Merperson Trident]] and a portrait of Hogwarts, which was also a Portkey and transported them out of the Vault.<ref name=\"HM530\"/>\n\n=====Returning to Hogwarts=====\nJacob's sibling and their friends landed in the [[Great Hall]], where they spent some time with [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] before she was sent to the [[Hospital Wing]] while others called the professors. During this time, [[Ben Copper|Ben]] seemed too shocked to behave normally. Jacob's sibling later had a conversation with [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] about [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] and visited [[Beatrice Haywood|Beatrice]] and Merula.<ref name=\"HM531\">{{HM|5|31}}</ref>\n\nBefore Jacob's sibling and Merula sorted out where their relationship was going, Ben alerted them that [[Sickleworth]] had been missing. They went to [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] and [[Silvanus Kettleburn|Kettleburn]] for help, who gathered a lot of [[Crup]]s and [[Puffskein]]s to cheer them up, and even to [[Red Cap's Hole]], where they met [[Red Cap in the Forbidden Forest|the Red Cap]] (who was struck down by Ben with the [[Knockback Jinx]]) and found Sickleworth with a [[Coral Key]]. However, he escaped again when they were in [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], but they found him soon enough. Ben later confessed the impact of the latest incident on him and his decision of turning into a new person.<ref name=\"HM532\">{{HM|5|32}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the school year, Jacob's sibling and [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] planned a surprise party at the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]] for [[William Weasley|Bill]] who was about to graduate. During the party, [[Alastor Moody]] [[Apparition|Apparated]] in who said to Jacob's sibling they had much to talk about, and Disapparated with them immediately. For the next hours, they were told some secrets which would change everything.<ref name=\"HM533\">{{HM|5|33}}</ref>\n\n====Sixth year====\nDuring the [[1989\u20131990 school year]], their [[sixth year]], Jacob's sibling proceeded to take [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]],<ref name=\"HM61t\">{{HM|6|1|t}}</ref> [[Charms (class)|Charms]],<ref name=\"HM61c\">{{HM|6|1|c}}</ref> [[Divination (class)|Divination]],<ref name=\"HM62\">{{HM|6|2}}</ref> [[Herbology]],<ref name=\"HM62h\">{{HM|6|2|h}}</ref> [[History of Magic]],<ref name=\"HM62hm\">{{HM|6|2|hm}}</ref> [[Potions (class)|Potions]],<ref name=\"HM63p\">{{HM|6|3|p}}</ref> [[Care of Magical Creatures]],<ref name=\"HM63cmc\">{{HM|6|3|cmc}}</ref> [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]],<ref name=\":0\">In {{HM|6|5}}, [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] noted that Jacob's sibling and their class had a [[Unidentified 1989\u20131990 Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher|useless teacher]] for that year, with this revealing that Jacob's sibling had proceeded to take [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]].</ref> and [[Astronomy]].<ref name=\"HM625\">{{HM|6|25}}</ref>\n\n=====The school year's start=====\nAt the start of the [[1989\u20131990 school year]] [[Start-of-Term Feast]], [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] delivered a speech as usual urging students to focus on their studies. Jacob's sibling didn't see [[Merula Snyde|Merula]], [[Ben Copper|Ben]] and [[Beatrice Haywood|Beatrice]] at the Feast. [[Alastor Moody]] then met them in the [[Hog's Head Inn]], retold the persues of [[R]], and said he would keep them updated with his findings and teach them to protect them and their friends.<ref name=\"HM61\">{{HM|6|1}}</ref>\n\nThey learned from [[Penny Haywood|Penny]] that Beatrice had estranged her over the summer and her appearance was barely recognisable. They went to the [[Courtyard]] and saw [[Beatrice Haywood|Beatrice]] hanging out with Ismelda, having adopted the same hair-over-one-eye appearance. They tried talking to them but couldn't get them to trust them, so they went to Barnaby for help and only received the advice of \"spending more time with Beatrice\".<ref name=\"HM62\"/>\n\nBefore they had time to talk to Beatrice, however, Beatrice and [[Severus Snape|Snape]] had found a [[Petrification|Petrified]] student, presumably by a [[statue curse]]. Later, Jacob's sibling took their first [[Divination (class)|Divination class]]. Before the class ended, [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] predicted something about them that was mostly ominous.<ref name=\"HM62\"/>\n\n=====Deciphering the prophecy=====\n[[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] and [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] decided to help Jacob's sibling decipher the prophecy, and when Percy mentioned one had to be as skilled at [[Divination]] as a [[Centaur]] to interpret it correctly, Jacob's sibling thought of [[Torvus]] and consulted him, but he didn't make out anything either. It was possible for Jacob's sibling to meet other Centaurs, but in order to do so, they must prepare some offerings to be allowed in the [[Centaur Camp]]. So they gathered some herbs from [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]], some [[rock cake]]s from [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] and [[Badeea Ali's star chart|a historical star chart]] from [[Badeea Ali|Badeea]].<ref name=\"HM63\">{{HM|6|3}}</ref>\n\nHaving gained these items, Jacob's sibling was allowed in the Centaur Camp by [[Firenze]], who agreed to uncover the meaning of the prophecy, but would have to take some time to interact with the heavens to do so. In the [[Artefact Room]], after Jacob's sibling listened to an argument between [[Penny Haywood|Penny]] and [[Beatrice Haywood|Beatrice]], they noticed a skull was missing and suspected [[Ben Copper|Ben]] who had claimed to steal and trade it. They went to [[Knockturn Alley]] and asked Ben about the skull, but Ben was instead searching for answers about [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]] and the final [[Cursed Vaults|Cursed Vault]]. Ben confronted another wizard who revealed himself to be [[Mundungus Fletcher]]. He told them he had spotted the [[white-robed wizard]] who had attacked him again and had been laying low to prevent him from knowing his whereabouts. Later, Jacob's sibling discussed recent matters with [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], and when they mentioned the white-robed wizard, Dumbledore was reminded of the [[Mahoutokoro School of Magic]], from where students would be expelled with their robes turning white if they broke the [[Japanese wizard's code]] or practised [[Dark Arts|Dark Magic]].<ref name=\"HM64\">{{HM|6|4}}</ref>\n\n=====Bill returned=====\nJacob's sibling was surprised to hear [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] returning to Hogwarts. After they greeted him in the [[Classroom 3C|Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom]], he said he had come to tutor them and their friends since [[Unidentified 1989\u20131990 Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher|this year's DADA professor]] was particularly useless. For their first lesson, they learned the [[William Weasley's modified cursed barrier|Cursed Barrier Spell, but modified so that anyone '''with''' the Dark Mark was prevented from entering]]. Later, they found [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] in [[Red Cap's Hole]] who claimed to have followed a wizard here that looked like [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]].<ref name=\"HM65\">{{HM|6|5}}</ref>\n\n=====A curse-breaking mission=====\n{{Expand}}\nJacob's sibling and their friends helped [[William Weasley|Bill]] retrieve [[Urgruff's egg]] from the [[Romanian Dragon Sanctuary]].<ref name=\"TDT\">{{HM|6|THE DRAGON'S TREASURE}} - This event takes place after Chapter 5 of Year 6.</ref>\n\n=====Finding Jacob=====\nThey confirmed from [[Irma Pince|Madam Pince]] that the wizard had indeed been Jacob, who in fact had been in the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]] rummaging through books, but couldn't find the books he wanted. They then went to [[Flourish and Blotts]] and talked to [[Villanelle|Madam Villanelle]], who told them Jacob had looked for books on [[Mahoutokoro School of Magic]]. They thought Jacob might have left a secret message again, but none was found. They encountered [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] in [[Knockturn Alley]] who was still planning to kill [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]], and Jacob [[Apparition|Apparated]] to their side seconds later, who said an assassin was after both them and Merula. They wanted to know more about Jacob's target and motivation, but he still didn't have much time and left after a quick practise duel.<ref name=\"HM66\">{{HM|6|6}}</ref>\n\n=====Tutoring Levi Kidd=====\n{{Expand}}\nJacob's sibling accompanied and tutored [[Wilfred Levi Kidd]] on his first [[Curse-Breaker|curse-breaking]] mission.<ref name=\"RCB\">{{HM|6|THE RISE OF A CURSE-BREAKER}} - This event takes place after Chapter 6 of Year 6.</ref>\n\n=====Looking for an owl=====\nJacob's sibling met [[Cedric Diggory]] who just started school, and when they were talking, Jacob's sibling saw [[Sickleworth]] running by carrying a white feather in his mouth. They picked up Beatrice while following his trace and tracked all the way down to the [[Classroom 1B|Transfiguration Classroom]], but didn't find Sickleworth. Jacob's sibling thought Rakepick (whom Sickleworth might have been following) could have been investigating the [[statue curse]] and went to the [[Hospital Wing]] where all [[Petrification|Petrified]] students were resting. They caught a glimpse of Sickleworth there, and followed him to [[Jacob's room]] and met Jacob, who believed the feather was a [[Transfiguration|Transfigured]] quill. Jacob's sibling [[Untransfiguration|Untransfigured]] it into [[R's notes#R's note (VII)|a note]] and discovered it to be for themselves, warning they \"owed\" a friend's life. After Jacob declined to let them search for Rakepick with him for their safety, they decided to investigate the [[owl]] from whom the feather had been taken.<ref name=\"HM67\">{{HM|6|7}}</ref>\n\nThey went up to the [[Owlery]] and searched for the owl with [[Talbott Winger|Talbott]] who happened to be there, but failed. However, Talbott mentioned him seeing a white owl flying over the [[Forest Grove]] at some point, and that was where Jacob's sibling later saw the owl with [[Liz Tuttle|Liz]], [[Chiara Lobosca|Chiara]] and [[Borf]]. Unfortunately, they scared away the owl, who had been given the name [[Artemis (owl)|Artemis]] by Liz. They didn't find the owl on the [[Hogsmeade station]] platform, which was a shady spot that owls preferred, and went to take a break in [[Zonko's Joke Shop|Zonko's]] with [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], but saw rogue [[Fanged Frisbee]]s flying around with no customers. They helped [[Bilton Bilmes|Bilton]] blasting them out of the way, and Bilton suggested looking in [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], which they did, and found out from [[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]] that [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]] had just been there and then gone to [[Knockturn Alley]].<ref name=\"HM68\">{{HM|6|8}}</ref>\n\n=====Searching for dark artefacts=====\nJacob's sibling arrived at Knockturn Alley and saw [[Ben Copper|Ben]] still interrogating dark wizards and witches. They encountered a witch who knew about the [[white-robed wizard]], and Jacob's sibling became suspicious and used the [[Revelio Charm]] to reveal [[Mundungus Fletcher]]. He said he had seen [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]] going to collect dark artefacts left behind with [[Artemis (owl)|Artemis]], which belonged to her associates. Jacob's sibling went search for dark artefacts in the [[Classroom 3C|Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom]], but the artefacts there weren't Rakepick's. [[Argus Filch|Filch]] told them they were in the professors' hands, and knowing [[Severus Snape|Snape]] had a personal interest on Rakepick, they asked him about them and learned that Rakepick had cursed the artefacts with unfamiliar [[Dark Arts|Dark Magic]] that could only be broken by [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]. It turned out that Dumbledore had stored the artefacts at the [[Ministry of Magic]], and [[Tulip Karasu|Tulip]] happened to know that [[Chester Davies]], a former [[Ravenclaw]] [[Prefect]], was working for the Ministry.<ref name=\"HM69\">{{HM|6|9}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Flourish and Blotts]], Jacob's sibling discussed the matter with Chester. Chester thought the artefacts were stored in the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]], but was reluctant to sneak them in. Then he revealed that he himself had sneaked in with an [[invisibility cloak]], which got Jacob's sibling to ask [[Jae Kim|Jae]] if he could get one. Jae knew a person who might have one, but due to their unfriendly history, they had to gather a few gifts for him. They retrieved a [[Remembrall]] from [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]] and got some [[Fireproof sock|Fireproof Sock]]s from [[Andre Egwu|Andre]] before meeting their dealer, [[Alistair Fidgen]]. Alistair didn't forgive Jae for selling him fake [[love potion]]s, and Jacob's sibling had to duel him before he hurt Jae more. After the duel, he seemed appeased, but still wanted them to give him a real love potion before he could hand over the invisibility cloak.<ref name=\"HM610\">{{HM|6|10}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling gathered some [[rose thorn]]s from the [[Herbology Classroom]], [[peppermint]] from the [[Hogwarts kitchens|Kitchens]], powdered [[moonstone]] and [[Pearl Dust|pearl dust]] from a witch in Hogsmeade station to help [[Penny Haywood|Penny]] brew a love potion.<ref name=\"HM611\">{{HM|6|11}}</ref> They then successfully traded the potion for an invisibility cloak, and when Alistair heard them talking about breaking into the Ministry, he suggested using the cloak on easier targets first. So they first went to the [[Classroom 1B|Transfiguration Classroom]] to eavesdrop on [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]] and [[Filius Flitwick|Flitwick]] and heard them talking about a dangerous wizard from [[Mahoutokoro School of Magic|Mahoutokoro]] and an [[Student exchange programme|exchange programme]] with [[Castelobruxo]]. At the [[Care of Magical Creatures]] grounds, they heard [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] and [[Silvanus Kettleburn|Kettleburn]] discussing overly-aggressive [[Grindylow]]s in the [[Great Lake|Black Lake]]. They also spied on [[Cuthbert Binns|Binns]] and [[Irma Pince|Pince]] considering continuing the research about the history of [[Merpeople]] they had agreed to do for Rakepick before she had taken flight. For the last practice, they eavesdropped in Hog's Head, but [[Alastor Moody|Moody]] [[Apparition|Apparated]] in, located them using [[Alastor Moody's magical eye|his magical eye]], and told them there was trouble on the [[Training Grounds]].<ref name=\"HM612\">{{HM|6|12}}</ref>\n\n=====Gathering allies=====\nThe trouble turned out to simply be a test of Jacob's sibling's duelling skills. After a duel, Moody alerted them that [[R]] had former [[Death Eaters]] in its ranks and a dark wizard had escaped going to [[Azkaban]]. When Jacob's sibling hurried to [[Divination (class)|Divination class]], [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] Saw a dark wizard had been sighted nearby and instructed students to scrutinise [[Rita Skeeter]]'s story about it on the [[Daily Prophet]]. Jacob's sibling sensed the dark wizard must have been near Hogwarts to be after them, so they thought of leaving Hogwarts, but the idea was eventually abandoned after they talked to their friends. After a brief skirmish between [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]], who felt a bit at loss due to his dangerous adventures with Jacob's sibling, and Ben, who wanted to stop Charlie from attacking them more, Ben went with Jacob's sibling to the [[Aragog's Lair|Spider's Lair]] to prove his abilities by showing them how he had taunted and attacked the Acromantula there (possibly [[Forest Vault Acromantula|the one guarding the Forest Vault]]). The Acromantula was immediately angered, and Jacob's sibling duelled it in time to prevent it from hurting Ben.<ref name=\"HM613\">{{HM|6|13}}</ref>\n\n[[File:ObservingPetrifiedPomfrey.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Jacob's sibling, [[Penny Haywood|Penny]] and [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] observing the [[Petrification|Petrified]] [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]]]]\nJacob's sibling thought Ben was too over-confident, but Ben didn't think there was such a thing, and insisted them meet [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] again,<ref name=\"HM613\"/> who was apparently not concerned about Ben being who he was. Then Cedric and Jacob's sibling went to the [[Hospital Wing]] to help [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] with [[Petrification|Petrified]] students while talking to each other, but before Jacob's sibling could recruit Penny and brew some Pepperup Potion, they had a conversation with the Weasley brothers and learned that [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]] had pulled off a prank again and [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]] had been missing, but nothing the Weasleys themselves couldn't handle. They successfully brewed the potion with Penny, but before they left the [[Potions Classroom]], Snape arrived and told them there were bigger problems, which was that Madam Pomfrey herself had been Petrified.<ref name=\"HM614\">{{HM|6|14}}</ref>\n\n=====Investigating the Black Lake=====\nSoon, [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] gathered all students in the [[Great Hall]] and gave some new rules in light of recent events, including staying close to the castle. Jacob's sibling followed this rule and researched the possible location of the [[Sunken Vault|final Cursed Vault]] in the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]] with Cedric, eventually deciding the Vault was close to or inside the [[Great Lake|Black Lake]]. Naturally, to investigate the Lake meant sneaking out of the castle, which they did with [[Beatrice Haywood|Beatrice]] (who threatened to tell Dumbledore their plan) and the [[invisibility cloak]], but didn't find any clues. Just as they were about to return to the castle, the [[white-robed wizard]] appeared, instantly hit Jacob's sibling with the [[Banishing Charm]] and left.<ref name=\"HM615\">{{HM|6|15}}</ref>\n\nNow heavily injured, Jacob's sibling turned to [[Chiara Lobosca|Chiara]] for help to heal the wounds. It turned out that Dumbledore knew what had happened at the lakeshore and gave Jacob's sibling and Beatrice detention. After the detention was over, [[Talbott Winger|Talbott]] met Jacob's sibling in the Owlery and told them he had found [[Artemis (owl)|the white owl]], but scared it away after she dropped the letters she was clutching, one of which was written in Japanese. They translated it in the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]] and found it describing white quills hidden at the Black Lake.<ref name=\"HM616\">{{HM|6|16}}</ref>\n\nThey went back to the lakeshore to search and found a white quill, which they [[Untransfiguration|Untransfigured]] to reveal [[R's notes#R's note (VIII)|a message]] sent by [[R]] addressed to the white-robed wizard, warning him the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] had authorised [[Dementor]]s for his arrest. Jacob's sibling immediately warned Dumbledore, who held another emergency meeting in the Great Hall informing students [[Auror]]s were on their way. When [[Alastor Moody|Moody]] arrived, he told them [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] had been at the lakeshore too when the [[Ambush at the Great Lake|ambush]] occurred, and it had been he who stopped the wizard from continuing to attack them. They wondered whether Jacob was still at Hogwarts, so they searched [[Jacob's room]] with Ben, but instead found a black quill, which, upon Untransfiguration, revealed [[R's notes#R's note (IX)|another note]] written to Jacob, asking him to meet the sender in the [[Forest Grove]].<ref name=\"HM617\">{{HM|6|17}}</ref>\n\n=====Battling in the Forest Grove=====\nJacob's sibling then joined up with [[Ben Copper|Ben]] to go together into the Forest Grove to intercept the meeting. Ben recruited [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] to join them, which was at first not accepted by Jacob's sibling, but they were eventually convinced to take her. Before the departure, they also learned ''[[Flipendo Maxima]]'' from [[Badeea Ali|Badeea]]. The three went into the [[Forbidden Forest]], heading to the [[Forest Grove]]. Unbeknownst to them however, they were being followed from a close distance behind them by [[Rowan Khanna|Rowan]]. Eventually they reached the Forest Grove, and began to search for clues.<ref name=\"HM618\">{{HM|6|18}}</ref>\n\nThe search led them to the discovery of an [[Opal Necklace]] belonging to [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]]. As they were discussing the discovery, a swarm of [[Dementor]]s showed up and circled the group. The group then began casting the [[Patronus Charm]] to protect themselves, however they were unsuccessful as they were overwhelmed with the sheer number of present Dementors.<ref name=\"HM618\"/>\n\n[[File:Rowan Death.gif|250px|thumb|right|[[Rowan Khanna|Rowan]]'s death at the hands of [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]]]]\nRakepick then [[Apparition|Apparated]] into the vicinity and cast a powerful [[Patronus Charm]], warding off all of the Dementors. She then engaged in [[Duel in the Forest Grove|a duel]] with the students, which was watched by Rowan. Eventually, Jacob's sibling and Merula were defeated, with only Ben still fighting. Rakepick deflected most of his attacks before Ben cast ''Flipendo Maxima'' at her, stating that it would teach her a lesson. She then told him that she would teach him a lesson for him to take to his grave, and subsequently cast a [[Killing Curse]] at Ben, intending to kill him. However, Rowan, who had been watching the entire duel from a close distance, sacrificed their life by jumping in front of Ben, ending their life and saving that of their friends.<ref name=\"HM618\"/>\n\n=====Forming the Circle of Khanna=====\n[[File:Rowan Tribute.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hogwarts students and staff raise their wand as a tribute to [[Rowan Khanna|Rowan]]]]\n[[Rowan Khanna|Rowan]]'s death struck the entirety of Hogwarts as an extremely painful event and their death was mourned by all of their friends, who found it difficult to come to terms with their tragic loss. In particular to suffer were Jacob's sibling, [[Ben Copper|Ben]], and [[Merula Snyde|Merula]], all of whom had watched them die. A memorial service took place in the [[Great Hall]], where [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] gave a brief eulogy of Rowan's life, aspirations and sacrifice before leading the students and staff in raising their wands as a tribute to Rowan.<ref name=\"HM619\">{{HM|6|19}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling and their friends gathered in their [[common room]]s, and the [[Head of House|Heads of House]] announced the ban of leaving the castle had been lifted because the [[white-robed wizard]] was off Hogwarts grounds. They went for a drink in the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]] and recollected memories about Rowan with everybody there.<ref name=\"HM619\"/>\n\n[[File:Circle of Khanna.jpeg|250px|thumb|right|Jacob's sibling, [[Ben Copper|Ben]] and [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] starting the [[Circle of Khanna]]]]\nRowan's murder prompted a vengeful Jacob's sibling, Merula and Ben to form their own secret organisation to combat the malevolent [[R]] and get revenge on [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]] for what she had done.<ref name=\"HM619\"/> They gathered some of their friends in the [[Hog's Head Inn]] and told them about R, the threat bigger than Rakepick. The organisation was named [[Circle of Khanna]] in memory of Rowan with Jacob's sibling taking up the role of leader.<ref name=\"HM620\"/>\n\nFor the first tasks, the members split into smaller groups based on their abilities and interests. Jacob's sibling was surprised to find [[Beatrice Haywood|Beatrice]] in the [[Classroom 3C|Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom]] since the Circle was supposed to be a secret. Beatrice expressed interest in joining the Circle, which Jacob's sibling and Penny didn't prevent. What's more, [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]] were seen practising spells in the [[Classroom 1B|Transfiguration Classroom]] and clearly had a interest in the Circle too. Jacob's sibling also visited the group at the [[Care of Magical Creatures]] grounds where [[Barnaby Lee|Barnaby]], [[Liz Tuttle|Liz]] and [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] were training [[Murtlap]]s and helped them search for a Murtlap, Hester. [[Badeea Ali|Badeea]] and [[Talbott Winger|Talbott]], on the other hand, were working on a [[map of the Great Lake]] in the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]] and discussed it with Jacob's sibling. Ben also invited Cedric to join the Circle.<ref name=\"HM620\"/>\n\nStill recovering from Rowan's death, Jacob's sibling had heart-to-heart conversations respectively with Dumbledore and [[Alastor Moody|Moody]], and while Dumbledore wanted them to focus on grieving and healing, Moody liked the idea of fighting a secret organisation with another secret organisation. Unfortunately, Cedric had broken his arm and was resting in the [[Hospital Wing]], and Jacob's sibling visited him, helped treating other patients and invited [[Chiara Lobosca|Chiara]] to join the Circle of Khanna, but Chiara was reluctant to do so because of her werewolf identity. Jacob's sibling eventually convinced her to join.<ref name=\"HM621\">{{HM|6|21}}</ref>\n\n=====Meeting Alanza Alves=====\nJacob's sibling was called in [[Headmaster's Office|Dumbledore's office]] and met [[Alanza Alves]], an exchange student from [[Castelobruxo]]. Learning that Dumbledore wanted them to be a guide for Alanza, they started at the [[Training Grounds]] where Jacob's sibling planned to talk to [[Badeea Ali|Badeea]] and [[Talbott Winger|Talbott]] about the [[map of the Great Lake]], and when Alanza thought the map was part of the tour, they showed it to her nevertheless, but decided to keep the [[Circle of Khanna]] a secret. However, Badeea let slip the name of the Circle, but Talbott made it up by saying it was a club, and when Alanza wanted to join, Jacob's sibling said it was better to experience classes first.<ref name=\"HM622\">{{HM|6|22}}</ref>\n\nThey went to the [[Potions Classroom]] and heard [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], [[Irma Pince|Madam Pince]] and [[Argus Filch|Mr Filch]] talking about things missing around the school. They then introduced Alanza and the staff to each other, and when Alanza described the three of them as \"grumpy\" and Filch called for [[Mrs Norris]] to leave, she unexpectedly purred and courted him and Alanza to Jacob's sibling's surprise. After class, [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] talked to Jacob's sibling about making the Circle of Khanna the top priority and was noticed by Alanza again.<ref name=\"HM622\"/>\n\n[[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] prepared several magical creatures in [[Hagrid's Garden|his garden]] as a \"creature welcome\", but unfortunately there were some conflicts among them due to the variety of their species. Jacob's sibling and Alanza calmed them down, during which Alanza showed great talent in dealing with creatures. While Alanza was talking to Hagrid, she mentioned the Circle of Khanna and that everyone was talking about it, making Hagrid feel both regretful (for not reaching out to Jacob's sibling sooner) and worried (that they might do something dangerous).<ref name=\"HM622\"/>\n\nJacob's sibling intended to continue their talk with Merula, and when they entered the [[Classroom 3C|Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom]], they saw [[Beatrice Haywood|Beatrice]] and [[Ismelda Murk|Ismelda]] brewing a potion with the exact ingredients that Snape had said to have been missing, along with the books about advanced potions from the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]]. Alanza deduced the potion was [[Felix Felicis]] from the spells of it, and Jacob's sibling learned that it was [[Penny Haywood|Penny]]'s idea to higher their luck in beating [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]]. When they couldn't conceal the facts anymore, Jacob's sibling explained everything about [[Rowan Khanna|Rowan]] and the Circle of Khanna to Alanza.<ref name=\"HM622\"/>\n\n=====Returning to the Forest Grove=====\nAfter a brief conversation with [[Ben Copper|Ben]] and [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] in [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], Jacob's sibling met [[William Weasley|Bill]] at [[Hogsmeade station]] who wanted to pay a visit to his younger brothers at school. They prepared his mother, [[Molly Weasley|Molly]]'s home-made fudge in the [[Hogwarts kitchens|Kitchens]] with [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] and [[Jae Kim|Jae]] and tricked [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]] into coming to the [[Owlery]] to receive it. When the Weasley brothers were all feeling down, Jacob's sibling helped explain the good side of life at Hogwarts, and when Fred mentioned [[Circle of Khanna]], Bill immediately guessed what it was and wanted to join. He later talked to Jacob's sibling, Ben and Merula in private and suggested working in an organised way by finding clues back at where [[Rowan Khanna|Rowan]] died as a start.<ref name=\"HM623\">{{HM|6|23}}</ref>\n\nBefore departure, Jacob's sibling spent a normal day at school. They had a lunch with [[Alanza Alves|Alanza]] and learned all about [[Castelobruxo]], and while attending [[Divination (class)|Divination class]], [[Chiara Lobosca|Chiara]] reminded them this night would be especially dangerous to go to the [[Forbidden Forest]] due to a full moon. They also volunteered in the [[Hospital Wing]] due to two more [[Petrification|Petrified]] students. In the Forbidden Forest, they encountered a [[werewolf]] and [[Attack in the Forest Grove|fought]] it, and when it was [[Stunning Spell|Stunned]], Chiara in werewolf form hopped in and chased it away. [[Torvus]] then appeared and delivered a message from [[Firenze]] that he would tell them his findings about the prophecy if they studied the constellation [[Cetus]].<ref name=\"HM624\">{{HM|6|24}}</ref>\n\nThey attended [[Astronomy]] class and studied Cetus under [[Aurora Sinistra|Professor Sinistra]]'s supervision, then went into the [[Centaur Camp]] and learned from Firenze that his interpretation was they would have to \"face a difficult decision, a powerful adversary, and another loss\" and that the future would take them beyond anything they had experienced in the past six years. They talked with [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] privately and decided it was necessary to better understand [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]].<ref name=\"HM625\">{{HM|6|25}}</ref>\n\n=====Becoming Head Boy or Girl=====\n{{Expand}}\nJacob's sibling received a surprise visit from [[Rowan Khanna|Rowan]], who guided them on their way of becoming [[Head Boy or Girl]].<ref name=\"HBG\"/>\n\n=====Bonding with Jacob and Beatrice=====\nSo they invited Charlie to go to the [[Prefects' Bathroom]] to visit [[Duncan Ashe|Duncan]] and learned he had used to have secret meetings with Jacob down in the [[boathouse]], so they went there and found a [[Black Quill (R's)|black quill]] and [[Untransfiguration|Untransfigured]] it to reveal [[Jacob's letter to Jacob's sibling|a letter]] written by Jacob that informed them to go to the lakeshore and cast ''[[Red Sparks|Vermillious]]'' if they wanted to meet him.<ref name=\"HM626\">{{HM|6|26}}</ref>\n\nThey went to the lakeshore and did so, and Jacob [[Apparition|Apparated]]. He explained all about his motivations of teaming up with [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]] and regrets towards his inability to stop her from hurting his sibling. Suddenly, Jacob spotted [[Beatrice Haywood|Beatrice]] floating on the [[Great Lake|Black Lake]].<ref name=\"HM626\"/> They rushed her to the [[Hospital Wing]], and she remembered going to the lake because of her nightmares about the [[white-robed wizard]] and seeing giant tentacles (of a [[Giant Squid]]) before jumping in to do some reconnaissance. To help Beatrice understand the nightmares, Jacob's sibling took her to see [[Severus Snape|Snape]] for guidance, who used [[Legilimency]], \"struggled to tell nightmare from reality\", and advised her to stop repressing her trauma. They enjoyed a game of [[Gobstone]] and heard [[Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]]'s compliments of her valour.<ref name=\"HM627\">{{HM|6|27}}</ref>\n\n=====Exploring the Whomping Willow=====\n[[File:StudyingGrindylows.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Jacob's sibling, [[Chiara Lobosca|Chiara]] and [[Talbott Winger|Talbott]] reading about [[Grindylow]]s in [[Flourish and Blotts]]]]\nReady to move on and face the future, Jacob's sibling held a meeting with the members of the [[Circle of Khanna]] and considered several threats in the [[Great Lake|Black Lake]]: [[Grindylow]]s, the [[Giant Squid]], and [[Merpeople]]. They consulted [[Silvanus Kettleburn|Kettleburn]] and [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], and read books about the Grindylows, but instead found a page about the [[Whomping Willow]] and a description that said it was a message exchange centre for a large dark organisation. Knowing [[Alanza Alves|Alanza]] was a natural with creatures, they asked her about the Willow but came down to talk about Alanza's school life instead. When they were finishing up, the [[Weird Sisters]] showed up. They had no choice but to ask [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] to review the Whomping Willow in [[Herbology]] class, who told them there was no way to get near the Willow.<ref name=\"HM628\">{{HM|6|28}}</ref>\n\nAfter class, Jacob's sibling was told [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] discovered the Circle of Khanna. In [[Headmaster's Office|his office]], they saw [[Ben Copper|Ben]] and [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] had been called up there too. They discussed possible consequences of their actions, but were surprised to find Dumbledore actually thinking it was a support group that focused on healing rather than vengeance. Later, they distracted Madam Pince and headed for the [[Restricted Section]] to research more about the Whomping Willow, and found Rowan's notes on the best woods for wands and broomsticks. It gave them motivation to head to the Whomping Willow, but first they called for Jacob and practised the [[Shield Charm]], when Merula walked in and insisted an extra meeting of the Circle during which Jacob's sibling teach them the Charm. After an argument with the members that Merula picked for the meeting, [[Argus Filch|Filch]] appeared and reported them to Dumbledore, who once again gave them detention.<ref name=\"HM629\">{{HM|6|29}}</ref>\n\nAfter detention, they went together to the Whomping Willow and found a [[Black Quill (R's)|black quill]] which Untransfigured to [[R's notes#R's note (X)|a message]]. Before they were able to read the whole message, the Willow attempted to stomp them, so they quickly fled, but didn't bring the message. They went for another try and got the message, and read that a meeting of a dark wizard society was soon to happen at [[Borgin and Burkes]]. They reviewed [[Concealment Charm]]s with [[Filius Flitwick|Flitwick]] and proper ways to disguise oneself with [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] and [[Tulip Karasu|Tulip]], and scouted out Borgin and Burkes with Jae, when they spotted [[Alistair Fidgen|Alistair]] and met [[Alastor Moody|Moody]].<ref name=\"HM630\">{{HM|6|30}}</ref>\n\n=====Infiltrating R's meeting=====\nThey had a talk with [[Alastor Moody|Moody]], who thought they needed an advanced strategy, such as disguising themselves to become a different person. They convinced Penny to brew some [[Polyjuice Potion]], and they went together to gather ingredients. In the Potions Classroom, [[Severus Snape|Snape]] walked in and warned them about all the perils of the Polyjuice Potion, but didn't stop them from collecting ingredients.<ref name=\"HM631\">{{HM|6|31}}</ref> They subsequently collected all ingredients from various places, including a strand of [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]]'s hair, and brewed the Polyjuice Potion with Penny, but since it needed a month to be finished, they thought of imitating Rakepick from the inside out to pass the time.<ref name=\"HM632\">{{HM|6|32}}</ref> They played pretend with [[William Weasley|Bill]], [[Merula Snyde|Merula]], [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]] and learned Rakepick's style with [[Alanza Alves|Alanza]] and [[Andre Egwu|Andre]].<ref name=\"HM633\">{{HM|6|33}}</ref> They recruited [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], [[Jae Kim|Jae]] and [[Talbott Winger|Talbott]] and confirmed from [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] that Rakepick herself would most probably not appear at the meeting.<ref name=\"HM634\">{{HM|6|34}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SkirmishInKnockturnAlley.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]] striking down Jacob's sibling]]\nWhen the Polyjuice Potion was ready and the time had come, Jacob's sibling put on Rakepick's outfit and transformed into her, while Tonks turned into a Dark Witch and Jae wore the [[invisibility cloak]]. They went to [[Borgin and Burkes]] and saw the [[white-robed wizard]] waiting outside with a Dark Witch. They was surprised that \"Rakepick\" showed up, but eventually made sense of it and talked to them about [[R]]'s plans. From them, Jacob's sibling learned there was a secret agent (in other words, a mole) inside Hogwarts who was making progress with their plans, but before furthering their conversation, the real Rakepick [[Apparition|Apparated]] and struck Jacob's sibling down, initiating [[Skirmish in Knockturn Alley (1989\u20131990)|a brief fight]] between Jacob's sibling's team, Moody, Jacob (who too Apparated) and Rakepick. Seeing as she was outnumbered, Rakepick Disapparated, and so did Jacob.<ref name=\"HM635\">{{HM|6|35}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling was too focused to realise the others had bound the white-robed wizard with ropes. Moody and they brought him back to the [[boathouse]] and interrogated him, learning nothing but that R was planning to recruit Jacob's sibling and expecting them to be its next leader, so Moody [[Stunning Spell|Stunned]] him and planned to throw him in [[Azkaban]]. Jacob's sibling gathered the [[Circle of Khanna]] in [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]] and discussed who the mole might've been, and it came down to [[Rolanda Hooch|Hooch]], Snape and [[Argus Filch|Filch]].<ref name=\"HM635\"/>\n\n=====Visiting the Merpeople=====\nJacob's sibling and [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] got [[Argus Filch|Filch]]'s attention by sticking a [[Blood-flavoured lollipop|Blood Pop]] on [[Mrs Norris]]. Filch expressed affection for the school and the staff when talking to them, which diminished the possibility of him being the mole. [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] didn't sound like a person who would respect [[R]] as well and seemed to not have any idea as to what a student was trying to accomplish by dive-bombing the [[Great Lake|Black Lake]]. Jacob's sibling and [[Severus Snape|Snape]]'s conversation, however, was interrupted by [[Barnaby Lee|Barnaby]], who, along with many others, found another [[Petrification|Petrified]] student. The situation showed them the search for the mole had to be put on hold and the focus should be breaking the [[statue curse]].<ref name=\"HM636\">{{HM|6|36}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling reviewed the [[Bubble-Head Charm]] with Barnaby and [[Ben Copper|Ben]] to improve their ability to breath underwater.<ref name=\"HM636\"/> After that, they decided to head into the Black Lake alone while Barnaby and Ben watched out for the mole. After sinking to the bottom surface, they saw a trident, encountered [[Unidentified Merwoman at the Great Lake|a hostile Merwoman]] and [[Skirmish in the Great Lake|fought]] her, and before things got worse, exited the Lake. Wanting to learn more about how to soothe [[Merpeople]], they interviewed [[Silvanus Kettleburn|Kettleburn]] and [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] with [[Liz Tuttle|Liz]], and also learned more in [[Flourish and Blotts]], where [[Chiara Lobosca|Chiara]] found out the local Merpeople were fond of [[music]].<ref name=\"HM637\">{{HM|6|37}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Weird Sisters Concert HM638.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Weird Sisters concert at the Great Lake]]]]\nJacob's sibling immediately thought of the [[Weird Sisters]] when it came to music.<ref name=\"HM637\"/> When talking to them, Jacob's sibling learned [[Argus Filch|Filch]] had plucked [[Kirley Duke|Kirley]]'s [[Kirley Duke's guitar|guitar]] and it was essential for a concert, so they went to [[Room 234-00|his office]] and found it just before Filch came in. Under the pretence of wanting to write a song about [[Mrs Norris]], they successfully took the guitar. After returning it, they did some planning and went to the Lake to do the [[Weird Sisters concert at the Great Lake|concert]]. The Merwoman Jacob's sibling had fought and another Merperson surfaced from the water and listened in joy.<ref name=\"HM638\">{{HM|6|38}}</ref>\n\nWhen Jacob's sibling entered the Lake again, they apologised and explained their intentions to the Merwoman, and she led them to the [[Merpeople village]]. The Village was huge and there appeared to be a lost city nearby. After waiting for a while, the Merwoman introduced Jacob's sibling to the [[Merqueen]]. The Merpeople showed them a broken [[lyre]], comb and [[necklace]] and wanted them to bring new versions of these items.<ref name=\"HM638\"/>\n\n=====Preparing for the Sunken Vault=====\n[[File:Picking Comb HM639.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Jacob's sibling picking a comb for the [[Merqueen]]]]\nAfter a brief discussion with their friends, Jacob's sibling convinced [[Alanza Alves|Alanza]] to give them one of her treasured [[necklace]]s and asked [[Jae Kim|Jae]] to acquire a [[lyre]]. Their search of combs with [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] in the [[Prefects' Bathroom]] came down to a failure, but they spotted [[Dennis (toad)|Dennis]], which indicated [[Tulip Karasu|Tulip]] was behind the missing combs. They found Tulip, [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]], who indeed snuck all the combs for a massive prank that turned everybody's hair into hideous colours, and after an explanation, Jacob's sibling managed to gain a good-looking comb.<ref name=\"HM639\">{{HM|6|39}}</ref>\n\nAfter a practice duel, [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] became more hostile than ever towards Jacob's sibling. [[Ben Copper|Ben]] speculated it was just her letting her feelings out, and suggested reading some of [[Rowan Khanna|Rowan]]'s notes to remind themselves of their purpose.<ref name=\"HM640\">{{HM|6|40}}</ref> Jae brought a lyre to [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], but its strings were broken. Knowing that [[Kirley Duke|Kirley]] could play string instruments, Jae brought it to him to fix it while Jacob's sibling and Merula considered who to bring to the [[Sunken Vault]] with them. Merula thought [[Ben Copper|Ben]] was a good idea, and Ben immediately showed his willingness. They also recruited [[Barnaby Lee|Barnaby]] to be their lookout for [[R]], and [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] to be with them in the adventure.<ref name=\"HM641\">{{HM|6|41}}</ref>\n\n=====Entering the Sunken Vault=====\n[[File:Merpeople Cheering HM642.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The [[Merpeople]] cheering for Jacob's sibling's team's song]]\nJacob's sibling, [[Merula Snyde|Merula]], [[Ben Copper|Ben]] and [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] went to the [[Merpeople village]] in the [[Great Lake|Black Lake]] and presented the [[lyre]], the comb, and the [[necklace]] to the [[Merqueen]]. After approving of those, the Merqueen also asked them to sing a song. They picked a song that was famous among them and sang together, and when they finished, the Merqueen and the other [[Merpeople]] applauded. This winned the Merqueen's consent to guide them to the [[Sunken Vault]].<ref name=\"HM642\">{{HM|6|42}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fighting Grindylows HM642.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Jacob's sibling's team fighting [[Grindylow]]s outside the fortress in which the [[Sunken Vault]] was located]]\nShe led them to the front of a stone fortress with no entrance where Jacob's sibling had spotted the trident on their previous visit. Knowing that the Sunken Vault must have been in there, they casted the [[Gouging Spell]] to make an opening, and a great many of angered [[Grindylow]]s swarmed through. After the team defeated them, they entered the fortress and spotted the mouth of a statue of a [[Giant Squid]] what might be the way to the Vault. They casted some more spells to remove the rock in front of the Vault and entered.<ref name=\"HM642\"/>\n\n[[File:Reliving Memories HM642.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Jacob's sibling reliving their worst memories in the [[Sunken Vault]]]]\nIt was essentially no different than any other Vault, with a glowing centre column and no visible treasures. When Jacob's sibling touched the column, the surroundings blackened, and they were stuck in a loop in which they relived the worst of their memories, including Merula's hostility, the gruelling encounter with [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]] in the [[Buried Vault]], and [[Rowan Khanna|Rowan]]'s death. The real Merula dragged them out of the loop, and they found out the others had also experienced similarly.<ref name=\"HM642\"/>\n\n[[File:Rakepick Duel HM642.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Jacob's sibling and [[Patricia Rakepick|Rakepick]] duelling]]\nRealising the true purpose of the [[Cursed Vaults]] might not have been waiting for someone to come in, but keeping insidious curses from coming out instead, the team decided to reseal the Sunken Vault. At the moment, having bypassed [[Barnaby Lee|Barnaby]]'s sentry, Rakepick showed up and promptly struck down the other three. Jacob's sibling had a intense duel with Rakepick and ultimately defeated her, before resealing the Vault and returning to the [[Hogwarts Castle|castle]] with the others to report to [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]].<ref name=\"HM642\"/>\n\n=====Throwing a party=====\nJacob's sibling recalled the experience with [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], who thought Hogwarts owed them a debt and considered them a hero. [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] told them they got to be a normal student again, something which he couldn't get now. They met [[Alastor Moody|Moody]] too and thought they still hadn't gained much clues of [[R]] and its mole inside Hogwarts. [[Talbott Winger|Talbott]] discovered [[Ben Copper's letter to Jacob's sibling|a letter]] to Jacob's sibling in the [[Owlery]], and they discovered it was the letter [[Ben Copper|Ben]] had written before they had entered the [[Buried Vault]]. In it, he had written about their friendship and expressed how much he had admired them. They then invited all their friends to [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]] and thanked every one of them.<ref name=\"HM643\">{{HM|6|43}}</ref>\n\nHaving been reminded by Jacob and Moody that life at Hogwarts could be exciting and wonderful, Jacob's sibling decided to throw a party to celebrate. [[Alanza Alves|Alanza]] suggested they choose [[Three Broomsticks Inn|Three Broomsticks]] for the venue, but [[Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]] didn't welcome the idea as her barmaid was ill in addition to all of the patrons, so [[Penny Haywood|Penny]] wanted to help her with her business, and they eventually acquired Rosmerta's consent. Jacob's sibling found [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]] in [[Zonko's Joke Shop]], who sneaked to [[Hogsmeade]] with the help of the [[Marauder's Map]], and asked for pranking advices. They even invited the [[Weird Sisters]] to perform some music, and discovered they were writing a song about their heroic acts and needed more information of them, so they helped with the lyrics.<ref name=\"HM644\">{{HM|6|44}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Attending Party HM644.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Jacob's sibling enjoying the [[Party at the Three Broomsticks Inn|party]] with their friends]]\nJacob's sibling went to the [[Party at the Three Broomsticks Inn|party]] and saw [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] and Professors Dumbledore, [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]] and [[Severus Snape|Snape]] attending, who were all happy to see them returning to normal life. Alanza then revealed she would be staying at Hogwarts for the [[1990\u20131991 school year|next school year]]. Jacob's sibling and their friends enjoyed the party with decorations, [[Butterbeer]] and [[music]]. Later, [[Jae Kim|Jae]] told them he had gotten a message from [[Mundungus Fletcher]].<ref name=\"HM644\"/>\n\n=====Finding out the mole=====\nJacob's sibling went to [[Diagon Alley]] with [[Jae Kim|Jae]] and met [[Mundungus Fletcher|Fletcher]] and [[Garrick Ollivander|Ollivander]]. Ollivander told them a young Dark Witch with dark clothes and wide-brimmed hat with feathers had recently come in to ask about the specifications of [[Jacob's sibling's second wand|Jacob's sibling's wand]] and said something about a [[white-robed wizard]]. Then [[Villanelle|Madam Villanelle]] recalled the Dark Witch talking out loud about the wand and had almost knocked over a book display in [[Flourish and Blotts]]. She had also talked about books and subjects they and [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] were interested in.<ref name=\"HM645\">{{HM|6|45}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Merula Meeting HM645.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Merula Snyde|Merula]] and the [[Dark Witch from Knockturn Alley]] (in a different look) having a secret meeting]]\nKnowing who she might have been, Jacob's sibling went to [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]] and saw [[Dark Witch from Knockturn Alley|the Dark Witch they had seen multiple times in Knockturn Alley]]. They eavesdropped on her and found out she was about to meet someone, possibly the Hogwarts mole, so later on, they brought their [[invisibility cloak]] and went to [[Knockturn Alley]], where they were shocked to see [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] come and say she was ready to join [[R]]. The Dark Witch transformed into a different look and [[Apparition|Disapparated]] with her.<ref name=\"HM645\"/>\n\n====Seventh year====\n=====The wandless duel=====\nAt the start of the [[1990\u20131991 school year]], Jacob's sibling reunited with their friends in the [[Great Hall]]. Before the [[Start-of-Term Feast]], [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] announced that [[Seventh year|seventh-year]] students would have the opportunity to explore various wizarding professions off the school grounds.<ref name=\"HM71\">{{HM|7|1}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling gathered the [[Circle of Khanna]], but the others were more interested in feeling unburdened and leading a normal life. They then met [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] in the [[Hog's Head Inn]], but before they could speak, [[Alastor Moody]] sat down beside them. They then told the two about what they had seen at the end of the [[1989\u20131990 school year|last school year]], and expressed some negative feelings about it. Moody suggested talking to someone they didn't know at Hogwarts since their acquaintances weren't very supportive.<ref name=\"HM71\"/>\n\nJacob's sibling went to [[History of Magic]] class, and [[Tulip Karasu|Tulip]] introduced [[Corey Hayden]] to them, who were talking to a crowd about today's lesson on [[Emeric the Evil]]. After Corey's lecture, Jacob's sibling discussed Emeric the Evil further with them. Just then, [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] showed up.<ref name=\"HM71\"/> Later, she spoke to them about her summer of spell-training and used the [[Knockback Jinx]] on them wandlessly. She then invited them to a wandless duel. Wanting to study about [[wandless magic]], Jacob's sibling went to the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]] but was forbidden to enter the [[Restricted Section]] where all the books about wandless magic resided. Corey came by, and after telling them the history of wandless magic, they used the [[Exploding Charm]] in the Library, giving Madam Pince reason to send them to the [[Hogwarts kitchens|Kitchens]] for detention, where house-elves, users of wandless magic, work.<ref name=\"HM72\">{{HM|7|2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Duel Lost HM72.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Jacob's sibling losing a wandless duel to [[Merula Snyde]]]]\nThey tried to let [[Pitts]] teach them, but it didn't went good. They then summoned Jacob and learned more, but their [[Banishing Charm]] was still very feeble. The time of duelling Merula had come, and Jacob's sibling suffered a big loss. She decided to teach them wandless magic to bring them to the same skill level as her, and said just like each person's wand was different, wandless magic worked for every person differently too. Jacob's sibling then cast a mildly powerful Knockback Jinx when they were focusing on things that made them feel at home.<ref name=\"HM72\"/>\n\n=====Investigating with Corey=====\nAfter [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] left, [[Corey Hayden|Corey]] revealed they knew something was off with Merula. They later explained that they came to the conclusion by observing Jacob's sibling's behaviour in their interactions with them and Merula. Corey decided they wanted to team up with Jacob's sibling in solving the mystery, so Jacob's sibling told them about Merula's resolve in joining [[R]].<ref name=\"HM72\"/>\n\nJacob's sibling attended [[Professor]] [[Arif Sikander]]'s [[Muggle Studies]] class with Corey while spying on Merula. During the whole lesson, Merula was taking notes, but at the end turned it into a [[Merula Snyde's letter to Badeea Ali|black quill]] that looked like [[R]]'s, and secretly passed it to [[Ismelda Murk|Ismelda]]. They followed Ismelda to the [[Owlery]], and after she left, they searched for the quill with [[Talbott Winger|Talbott]], [[Untransfiguration|Untransfigured]] it and read that there would be a meeting in the [[Artefact Room]] after supper.<ref name=\"HM73\">{{HM|7|3}}</ref>\n\nThey put on their [[invisibility cloak]] and waited with Corey outside the room, while Corey told detective stories and analysed that the guilty wasn't necessarily the first suspect. They then saw Merula heading to the Artefact Room with a figure in a black cloak, but before they could get close enough, [[Argus Filch|Filch]] stopped them and made them turn around. When Filch was finally gone, they headed to the Artefact Room and caught Merula and [[Badeea Ali|Badeea]] in it. They explained that Badeea was only Merula's [[Charms (class)|Charms]] tutor and had been secretly helping her due to it being \"humiliating\". The next day, Jacob's sibling and Corey reviewed the information they had so far.<ref name=\"HM73\"/>\n\n=====Ministry assignments=====\n[[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] gathered several students, including Jacob's sibling and assigned them a mission of visiting to the [[Ministry of Magic]], specifically the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]]. After expanding their knowledge base of the Ministry by talking to [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]], they acquired some [[Floo Powder]] from the professors. Meanwhile, [[Corey Hayden|Corey]] invited [[Beatrice Haywood|Beatrice]] to talk to Jacob's sibling about [[Merula Snyde|Merula]], during which she said Merula had been going to the [[Whomping Willow]] and always came back in a bad mood. Before going to the Ministry, [[Alastor Moody|Moody]] caught Jacob's sibling in time and warned them of possible agents of [[R]] inside the Ministry and that he had his own contacts there.<ref name=\"HM74\">{{HM|7|4}}</ref>\n\n[[File:No Credentials HM75.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Jacob's sibling stopped by [[Eric Munch]] when [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] passed by]]\nArriving at the Ministry, Jacob's sibling was checked by [[Eric Munch]] with a [[Probity Probe]] and dismissed when he heard they had no credentials. They explained themselves but it didn't help, and just as they were about to be forced to leave, they met [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], who vouched for them, gaining Jacob's sibling the consent to enter. Arthur then guided them to the [[Ministry All-Purpose Room|All-Purpose Room]] where they met [[Unidentified Metamorphmagus|Amos Diggory]], who was alone in the room, appeared to be amnesiac over recent events and rather grumpy. After giving some reminder to him, Jacob's sibling learned he was no longer in charge of the student programme and was asked to go to [[Office 34B]].<ref name=\"HM75\">{{HM|7|5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Umbridge HM75.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Jacob's sibling encountering [[Dolores Umbridge]] in [[Office 34B]]]]\nThey went to the office and found it was covered in pink and cat-related stuff with nobody in it. [[Dolores Umbridge]] then appeared and heckled them about their presence in her office. After Umbridge learned Jacob's sibling's name, she immediately turned friendly and thought they would like to meet [[Wilkie Twycross]] in the All-Purpose Room. Now the room was filled with people and Jacob's sibling met Twycross, who gave them a visitor badge as their credentials, taught the ''[[Rules of Conduct for Students Visiting the Ministry of Magic]]'' to them, and explained that Moody had requested that they go to the [[Auror Office]] along with another student, instead of the [[Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office]] which was the choice under normal circumstances.<ref name=\"HM75\"/>\n\nJacob's sibling went to the Auror Office and discovered the other student was [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]]. They practised duelling to burn off Tonks's extra energy, before Moody came in and told them to start their tasks.<ref name=\"HM75\"/> They then went to [[Ministry Office|an office]] to receive their first task, which was learning about Hogwarts as much as they could. After completing it by returning to Hogwarts and investigating, they went back to the Ministry to report to Moody that everything in Hogwarts was perfectly normal.<ref name=\"HM75A1\">{{HM|7|5|A Hogwarts Life}}</ref>\n\nThe second task was about a [[rogue alchemist]] who claimed to have invented a [[Rogue alchemist's fake panacea|panacea]], causing boils on its victims. Jacob's sibling interviewed a [[Unidentified witness (II)|witness]] who bought the dodgy panacea, tracked the alchemist with Tonks, researched, experimented with alchemy and discussed with Dumbledore about it. Later, Moody told them he had caught the alchemist thanks to their help, and the panacea had in fact been made from [[corn starch]] and [[lard]].<ref name=\"HM75A2\">{{HM|7|5|The Rogue Alchemist}}</ref>\n\n=====Enchanted windows mystery=====\n[[File:HurricaneWindows.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Jacob's sibling, [[Ben Copper|Ben]] and [[Reginald Cattermole|Reginald]] observing the hurricane windows]]\nAfter helping [[Eric Munch]] registering wands, Jacob's sibling and [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] went to see [[Arthur Weasley]] who taught them things about [[Portkey]]s to them in the [[Portkey Office]]. Due to malfunctioning [[enchanted window]]s which display a hurricane, Arthur could not continue his speech and tasked them to fix them. On the way to the [[Magical Maintenance Department]], they met [[Ben Copper|Ben]], [[Barnaby Lee|Barnaby]], Charlie and [[Liz Tuttle|Liz]] in front of the [[Ministry of Magic lifts|lifts]], and Barnaby brought up his uncle [[Cecil Lee|Cecil]] who had helped the Magical Maintenance Department before. Jacob's sibling went with Barnaby to talk to him, but he demanded them to duel each other first to see if they had the potential to join the [[Werewolf Capture Unit]]. After the duel, they learnt that only the windows in the Portkey Office were acting strange, which had not been the case before in which all of the windows were broken. When passing by the [[Ministry All-Purpose Room|All-Purpose Room]], they saw the hurricane windows had spread to it as well, and everyone was not able to work. [[Reginald Cattermole]], an employee from the Magical Maintenance Department, joined their conversation about it and said this window was the \"master window\" which controlled all the enchanted windows in the Ministry. After considering it for a while, Jacob's sibling and Ben thought the windows might have been cursed by a complicated spellwork.<ref name=\"HM76\">{{HM|7|6}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling now called it the \"enchanted windows mystery\" and reported to Moody with Tonks, suspecting it might have been a work of [[R]], though without solid evidence. Moody encouraged them to use their curse-breaking and detective skills to find out the truth, so they talked to Munch and read his documents, during which they noticed Reg had come in twice this morning without Munch having seen him leaving in-between. Reg himself denied this immediately and three others confirmed his continuous presence. However, Jacob's sibling found [[Reginald Cattermole's wand|his wand]] under a desk, one which [[Mafalda Hopkirk]] usually sat instead of him. Connecting the dots, Jacob's sibling deduced a fake Reg may have stolen the real Reg's wand to curse the enchanted windows and blame Reg.<ref name=\"HM77\">{{HM|7|7}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jacob's sibling and Ben releasing Tonks.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Jacob's sibling and Ben releasing [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] from a locked chest]]\nThey discussed this with [[Ben Copper|Ben]] and landed their guesses on the intruder either taking [[Polyjuice Potion]] or being a [[Metamorphmagus]]. Just then, Tonks left in a rush to supposedly see [[Wilkie Twycross]], and Jacob's sibling and Ben discovered a bouncing locked chest. They unlocked the chest and saw another Tonks in it, then realised the Tonks they had been working with was an [[Unidentified Metamorphmagus|imposter]], so they tried but failed to chase them down. The last memory that Tonks had was her stopping in the [[Auror Office]] for her quill and notepad when heading to the Magical Maintenance Department, and a man like a weasel (probably the fake Reg before becoming Tonks) coming in after her. They thought since they had been discovered while assuming both identities, they were now disguising as someone else. An Arthur Weasley approached them, and after he was confirmed to be really him, he told them a suspicious [[Amos Diggory]] had left the Portkey Office shortly before he had arrived and seen the windows, displaying the same rudeness and amnesia that Jacob's sibling themselves had seen when talking to him.<ref name=\"HM77\"/>\n\nAmos came into the All-Purpose Room, in which he usually rested around that time, shortly after them and acted like the real Amos. When he heard there may have been an imposter, he questioned Jacob's sibling instead about his son [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] to confirm their identity. Afterwards, when Jacob's sibling asked whether he had been in the Portkey Office, he said he had been helping the [[Pest Advisory Board]] with one of their [[albino bloodhound]]s instead, and that this was the first time he talked to them this day. This could mean nothing besides the imposter having been disguised as Amos.<ref name=\"HM77\"/>\n\nIn order to further investigate the enchanted windows curse, Jacob's sibling returned to Hogwarts and consulted [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]]. They also brought [[Reginald Cattermole's wand|Reg's wand]] for him to examine. Meanwhile, they reunited with [[Corey Hayden|Corey]] and were informed that Merula had been visiting the [[Hogwarts Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]] increasingly. When Jacob's sibling told Corey about the [[Unidentified Metamorphmagus|Metamorphmagus]], Corey suspected the [[Dark Witch from Knockturn Alley]] due to her previous transformation. Then, Merula showed up and called Jacob's sibling a \"Janitor\" for the maintenance work she thought they had been doing. Jacob's sibling wondered whether someone at the Ministry told her that, but Merula refused to divulge what she had been up to.<ref name=\"HM78\">{{HM|7|8}}</ref>\n\nJacob's sibling received Flitwick's [[owl]] and visited him again, who told them the curse had been the [[Atmospheric Charm]]. They then reviewed ''[[Meteolojinx Recanto]]'' which should act as a counter-spell. Going back to the [[British Ministry of Magic Headquarters|Ministry]], they successfully restored the windows using the spell. [[Alastor Moody]] also asked to see them and said the ensuing chaos had allowed someone to slip in unseen and steal a [[Portkey]] in the form of a [[Socks|sock]].<ref name=\"HM78\"/>\n\n=====Mysterious creature attack=====\n[[File:Jacob's sibling and friends in the Beast Division HM79.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Jacob's sibling and friends uniting in the [[Beast Division]]]]\nJacob's sibling and [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] gave [[Alastor Moody|Moody]] a formal debrief and received a visit from [[Wilkie Twycross]], who announced that Jacob's sibling would be going to the [[Beast Division]] in the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]] at [[Amos Diggory]]'s invitation. There, they met [[Barnaby Lee|Barnaby]], [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] and [[Liz Tuttle|Liz]] who were assigned to the same division, and listened to Amos's lecture about it. He asked Jacob's sibling and Liz to investigate an odd creature sighting in [[Hogsmeade]].<ref name=\"HM79\">{{HM|7|9}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jacob's sibling questioning Umbridge HM79.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Jacob's sibling questioning [[Dolores Umbridge]] about the creature attack]]\nThey went to the [[Hogsmeade station]] platform and saw [[Dolores Umbridge]] who looked like injured with a claw mark and said to have been attacked by an unknown creature on her way to [[Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop|Madam Puddifoot's]] but not remember anything except the falling. When Jacob's sibling speculated she might have been attacked by a big cat, she turned angry and refused help from a \"child\". Then, [[Puddifoot|Madam Puddifoot]] came in and informed them that a Hogwarts student had been found near [[Zonko's Joke Shop|Zonko's]] with large scratches earlier that day and too couldn't have seemed to recall how exactly she had gotten there.<ref name=\"HM79\"/>\n\n[[File:Jacob's sibling and Liz visiting Ismelda HM79.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Jacob's sibling and [[Liz Tuttle|Liz]] visiting [[Ismelda Murk|Ismelda]] in the [[Hospital Wing]]]]\nThey rushed to the [[Hospital Wing]] and found out the student to be [[Ismelda Murk|Ismelda]], who bore a similar mark. She recounted heading to the [[Three Broomsticks Inn|Three Broomsticks]] and seeing some big yellow eyes, but before Jacob's sibling could ask for more, [[Merula Snyde|Merula]], who was keeping Ismelda company, said she needed to rest and made them leave. After researching in the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]], Jacob's sibling thought it might've been a [[Wampus cat]] which was native to [[North America]] and had yellow eyes which had powers of [[hypnosis]] and [[legilimency]]. After Liz left to read some more, [[Corey Hayden|Corey]] caught Jacob's sibling up with her recent investigations.<ref name=\"HM79\"/>\n\n[[File:Jacob's sibling clashing with Tim.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Jacob's sibling clashing with [[Tim (Wampus cat)|Tim]]]]\nReturning to the Ministry, Jacob's sibling gave their report to Amos, who believed the situation was worth looking further into. He instructed them and Charlie, who returned from [[Niffler]]-related tasks, to study the [[Ministry accident reports]], in which they saw a lot of mentions of [[Silvanus Kettleburn|Professor Kettleburn]], so they consulted him and got his suggestion of using a Niffler as bait after practising catching [[Kneazle]]s as a warm-up. After they formed their plan with Liz, Charlie placed a [[Golden Snitch]] in [[Hagrid's Garden]] and it naturally attracted a Niffler. Jacob's sibling attempted to hit it with the [[Stunning Spell]], but it jumped out of the way, causing them some troubles to capture it. After it was successfully Stunned, they brought it to Hogsmeade station and it lured out the Wampus cat. Jacob's sibling had a brief [[Attack at Hogsmeade station|fight]] with him, and after he knocked their wand out of their hand, they Stunned him wandlessly. When they came close to secure him, they noticed what looked like the [[Socks|sock]] [[Portkey]] near him. Liz also named him [[Tim (Wampus cat)|Tim]].<ref name=\"HM710\">{{HM|7|10}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jacob's sibling and Liz delivering Tim to Kettleburn.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Jacob's sibling and [[Liz Tuttle|Liz]] delivering [[Tim (Wampus cat)|Tim]] to [[Silvanus Kettleburn|Kettleburn]]]]\nAfterwards, Jacob's sibling talked to Moody about this assignment and the sock, which Moody confirmed was the missing Portkey and thought might have been another distraction. He proposed that Jacob's sibling focus on Merula and his assignments while he work on [[R]]. Jacob's sibling then headed to the Department of Magical Creature Regulation and celebrated with their friends and Amos and delivered Tim to Professor Kettleburn who had decided to care for him. They then talked with Merula, during which they voiced their suspicion of her, in particular, her constant change of tone and manners. Merula responded by saying she was still trying to figure out what kind of person she wanted to be. Before the conversation could reach a natural ending, [[Ben Copper|Ben]] picked up Jacob's sibling and went see Twycross, who informed them of their new positions.<ref name=\"HM711\">{{HM|7|11}}</ref>\n\n=====Memory loss catastrophe=====\n[[File:Xeep Meet-and-Greet.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Xeep]] Meet-and-Greet]]\n[[Alastor Moody|Moody]] greeted Jacob's sibling and [[Ben Copper|Ben]] at the [[Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes]] while the Head of Department was unavailable, and intended them to interview [[Garrick Ollivander]] about a [[Garrick Ollivander's misfiring wand|backfired wand]] as the first task. Ollivander originally acknowledged the existence of a misfiring wand, but later claimed to not remember such wand at all, and wanted to leave and meet [[Zenith Xeep]], a renowned [[Opera singer|opera diva]] in the [[wizarding world]], so Jacob's sibling offered to come with him. They met Zenith and [[Rita Skeeter]] in the [[Leaky Cauldron]] and heard about Zenith's new beauty-and-lifestyle business, [[Xeep]], and its product, [[Xeep's Luscious Locks Solution]], which Ollivander had been using for a week and spoke highly of. Jacob's sibling was gifted a bottle of it, and then returned to [[Ollivanders]] with Ben.<ref name=\"HM712\">{{HM|7|12}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jacob's sibling and Ben with the fake wand.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Jacob's sibling and [[Ben Copper|Ben]] with the fake [[wand]]]]\nOllivander remembered having the wand again, and they found a suspicious wand, which he determined to be a fake, leading them to believe the real one had been stolen. He recalled having amnesiac symptoms for a week and found [[Villanelle|Madam Villanelle]] to have visited his shop during this time according to his ledger. When they visited her, she was oblivious of her visit as well, but was immediately reminded of the backfired wand when Jacob's sibling mentioned it. Both Ollivander and Villanelle had been using Xeep's Luscious Locks Solution when their memory problems occurred, which they doubted was a coincidence.<ref name=\"HM712\"/>\n\nBack at the Ministry, Moody informed Jacob's sibling and Ben [[Obliviator]]s had been sent to restore Ollivander and Villanelle's memories (but they were not successful), and that the Ministry had been confiscating Xeep's Luscious Locks Solution, which might've been the reason Zenith was hiding. Moody tasked them to restore the two's memories themselves, and since Jacob's sibling still had a vial of the Solution with them, they found [[Penny Haywood|Penny]], and then [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], and had them examine it. Snape identified the [[Forgetfulness Potion]] to be a base of this complex Solution and was willing to brew a [[Counter-serum for Xeep's Luscious Locks Solution|counter-serum]] for them. Meanwhile, Jacob's sibling practised [[wandless magic]] with Ben and went through an interview with Rita, who demanded them find out what the Ministry was planning by breaking into [[Dolores Umbridge|Umbridge]]'s [[Office 34B|office]] before she could tell them where Zenith was.<ref name=\"HM713\">{{HM|7|13}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dungbomb setting off in Office 34B.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Dungbomb]] setting off in [[Office 34B]]]]\nJacob's sibling and Ben talked about setting up distractions for Umbridge, and Ben came up with the idea of pretending to do office checks as an assignment of the [[Magical Maintenance Department]]. Jacob's sibling asked [[Tulip Karasu|Tulip]] to meet in [[Zonko's Joke Shop|Zonko's]] and she helped them choose a [[Dungbomb]]. When they went to [[Office 34B]] and met Umbridge, she wanted to have tea with them right away, and when they prepared to place the Dungbomb, she noticed, but they explained it away. When she pressed them about the treasures in the [[Sunken Vault|final Cursed Vault]], the Dungbomb set off and Umbridge blamed [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]], leaving the room. Jacob's sibling searched the office and found a paper about a [[Wizengamot]] trial.\n\n[[File:Jacob's sibling confronting Zenith Xeep.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Jacob's sibling duelling [[Zenith Xeep]]]]\nThey talked to Rita and she told them to find Zenith in [[Knockturn Alley]], where they then saw Zenith meeting with a [[Dark Witch from Knockturn Alley|Dark Witch]], originally disguised as [[Wilkie Twycross]]. Ben couldn't wait and jumped out when Zenith was about to hand over the [[Wand stolen by Zenith Xeep|wand she had stolen]], and the Dark Witch used the [[Stunning Spell]] on him. Jacob's sibling came out too, the Dark Witch [[Apparition|Disapparated]], and they [[Skirmish in Knockturn Alley (1990\u20131991)|duelled]] Zenith. After they won, Zenith drank a bottle of Xeep's Luscious Locks Solution, making herself forget what had happened, thus preventing Jacob's sibling from knowing. However, she also forgot her name.<ref name=\"HM714\">{{HM|7|14}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Victims drinking the counter-serum HM715.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Victims drinking the [[Counter-serum for Xeep's Luscious Locks Solution|counter-serum]]]]\nBack at the Ministry, Moody questioned Jacob's sibling about disobeying his order of not pursuing this case before consulting with him, and then asked them about their confrontation with Zenith. They discussed the Dark Witch, who Moody believed was a high-ranking member of [[R]]. Jacob's sibling then checked in with Professor Snape and Penny and helped them finish brewing the counter-serum. They went to Ollivanders and offered the victims the counter-serum, which seemed to have taken effect.<ref name=\"HM715\">{{HM|7|15}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jacob's sibling speaking with Cornelius Fudge HM715.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Jacob's sibling speaking with [[Cornelius Fudge]]]]\nJacob's sibling met with [[Corey Hayden|Corey]] in [[Three Broomsticks Inn|Three Broomsticks]] and talked about the phoenix feather wand and [[Merula Snyde|Merula]]. Corey told them about the note ([[Paper to quill spell|transfigured]] as a quill) she had intercepted from Merula, which said that she wouldn't put her friends in danger again. Alastor Moody then showed up and brought Jacob's sibling to see [[Cornelius Fudge]], who spoke to them about the upcoming Wizengamot trial of the [[white-robed wizard]], which they, [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] and Merula would be required to testify. Jacob's sibling was worried how everyone would react if the wizard would say R wanted to recruit them.<ref name=\"HM715\"/>\n\n=====Doxy infestation=====\n[[File:Victor talking about his experience in the Great Hall 2.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Jacob's sibling talking to [[Corey Hayden|Corey]] beside [[Victor Ketsueki]]]]\nAs the [[Chief Warlock]] of the [[Wizengamot]], [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] spoke to Jacob's sibling about the trial and reminded them of the gravity of the situation. They talked to [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] thereafter, who stormed off upon hearing some friendship speech involving [[Ismelda Murk|Ismelda]] from them. They also spoke to [[Corey Hayden|Corey]] about her and noticed [[Victor Ketsueki]], a [[Ravenclaw]] student in their year, talking to a bunch of students.<ref name=\"HM716\">{{HM|7|16}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jacob's sibling Untransfiguring black quill.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Jacob's sibling [[Untransfiguration|Untransfiguring]] [[R's notes#R's note (XI)|R's quill]]]]\nJacob's sibling and Corey went to the [[Hogwarts Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]] and found [[R's notes#R's note (XI)|another note]] which warned the receiver not to cross \"us\". It suggested that Merula may not have been completely on [[R]]'s side. Just as they [[Untransfiguration|Untransfigured]] it back to a black quill, Merula arrived and confronted them, but they fobbed her off and soon left. The two then discussed the note and Merula in the [[Artefact Room]], and thought it would be a good idea to ask Merula to become a double agent. Suddenly, a [[Doxy]] flew out and bit Corey.<ref name=\"HM716\"/>\n\n[[File:Jacob's sibling, Barnaby, Chiara and a Bundimun.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The students with a [[Bundimun]] in [[Hagrid's Garden]]]]\nWhen Jacob's sibling visited Corey in the [[Hospital Wing]], they heard from [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] that many students suffered Doxy bites, indicating a Doxy infestation. They visited [[Silvanus Kettleburn|Professor Kettleburn]] and learnt more about Doxies with [[Chiara Lobosca|Chiara]] while feeding [[Fire Crab]]s, and then went to the [[Herbology Classroom]] to collect ingredients for [[Doxycide]] with [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] and [[Barnaby Lee|Barnaby]], who believed he was the cause of the infestation. Due to a lack of [[Bundimun Secretion|Bundimun Ooze]], they looked for some [[Bundimun]]s in [[Hagrid's Garden]] and captured one using the [[Stunning Spell]]. With all of the ingredients, Jacob's sibling completed brewing some Doxycide with [[Ben Copper|Ben]] in the [[Potions Classroom]]. Chiara then alerted them to Doxies showing up in [[Peeves' Room]].<ref name=\"HM717\">{{HM|7|17}}</ref>\n\n==Physical description==\nJacob's sibling's physical appearance is mostly a mystery. However, it is known that they are slender and of average height. They usually wore the traditional school robes.<ref>On every loading screen, Jacob's sibling is seen from a backview.</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nJacob's sibling was extremely compassionate and, while not as perceptive as their best friend [[Rowan Khanna]], still possessed a keen intellect. They were very talented and academically competent, being skilled in a number of magical fields, receiving much praise from the majority of their teachers, often responding to such praise by grinning. They were also skilled at coming up with things quickly and lying effectively, though they never lied if they could avoid doing so.\n\nThanks to the actions of their brother [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]], they were often the subject of dislike and apprehension and had difficulty making friends. They were unfazed by this, and instead chose to be nonjudgmental and accepting of those around them. Jacob's sibling was very loyal to their friends. They were always eager to help them, such as when they helped [[Ben Copper]] overcome his fear of [[Flight|riding]] a [[broomstick]] and convinced him to stop isolating in a closet, and when they acted like they could see through [[Talbott Winger]]'s apparent lack of desire for friendship in general. Jacob's sibling was also very empathetic, as best shown by how they treated Talbott Winger, [[Barnaby Lee]], [[Ismelda Murk]] and [[Merula Snyde]].\n\nJacob's sibling was very courageous, as they stood up to [[Merula Snyde]], [[Severus Snape]], and even [[Fenrir Greyback]], and sought out the [[Cursed Vaults]] relentlessly in spite of the teachers warning them not to. Jacob's sibling believed that in finding the vaults, they would gain new knowledge and treasure, but most of their drive came from wanting to find their brother, whom they loved unconditionally.\n\nThough never a defining trait, Jacob's sibling had a cheeky and occasionally sarcastic sense of humour, such as when they encouraged Ben to stop isolating and added \"''&hellip;though the skulls might miss you''\". In their first year, Merula told them they were unwanted to which they replied \"''You're the one everyone wishes would just go away.''\" When [[Chiara Lobosca]] accused them of having ulterior motives for chatting, they replied, \"''It's possible my ulterior motive might be trying to get to know you better.''\"\n\nIn their [[second year]], Jacob's sibling developed a passion for [[Quidditch]] as well as possessing a natural talent for it, which created a bond with [[Skye Parkin]] and, later, [[Erika Rath]]. They initially started as a [[Chaser]], though in subsequent years, opening in the team roster also saw them playing [[Beater]], [[Keeper]], and [[Seeker]]. In their fourth year, team captain [[Orion Amari]] stepped back from duties while recovering from an injury, so Jacob's sibling and Skye split the captain's role between them.\n\nFor Jacob's sibling, their years at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] had been a journey of growth and renewal. Despite being a lonely child who frequently watched their brother closely with immense concern and kept to themselves, Jacob's sibling had found a family at school that could relate to them and give them new purpose and meaning. Their social skills improved phenomenally during their magical education. Indeed, they tended to form the closest relationships (positive and negative) with students who brought out their own strengths: being around [[Rowan Khanna]] had made them more intellectual, being around [[Ben Copper]] had made them more compassionate, being around [[Penny Haywood]] had made them more extroverted, being around [[Nymphadora Tonks]] had made them more unafraid of being themselves, being around [[Skye Parkin]] had made them more sports-minded, and being around [[Merula Snyde]] had made them more empathetic and less vulnerable. Jacob's sibling tended to have some of those effects on their friends in turn, as people like Haywood and [[Talbott Winger]] had pointed out, they were both a safe place and dependable source when their friends were vulnerable, endangered, conflicted, or all of the above.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n{{Quote|[[Lucius Malfoy|Father]] says you are the best in your year.|Draco Malfoy|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n*'''[[Magic]]al aptitude''': An academically strong student, Jacob's sibling quickly achieved such good results in their schoolwork that they received praise from most of their teachers, with [[Albus Dumbledore]], arguably the greatest wizard of all time, openly acknowledging their magical prowess to be exemplary. They demonstrated tremendous ability and proved a cleverer student than most of their classmates, quickly mastering and becoming the best in most of the fields of magic taught at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Indeed, their formidable magical power allowed them to achieve [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]]s in all their subjects, to apprehend the immensely savage [[Fenrir Greyback]] alongside the [[Werewolf Capture Unit]], to assist [[Auror]] [[Alastor Moody]] in tracking down the malevolent organisation [[R]], to come out as the triumphant winner of the prestigious [[All-Wizard Tournament]], to master the extremely powerful and difficult [[Patronus Charm]] by only their fourth year, and to save Hogwarts from the menacing threat of the [[Cursed Vaults]] on numerous occasions.\n*'''[[Love]]''': Jacob's sibling loved [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|their older brother]] unconditionally, being devastated when he went missing from home and shedding tears over his sudden disappearance. Their love for him spurred them to take action and rescue him by obsessively searching for the [[Cursed Vaults]] for many years, despite their teachers explicitly forbidding them to do so under the threat of expulsion from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and despite the extreme danger in which Jacob's sibling repeatedly placed themselves under while seeking out each of the Cursed Vaults. Although their love was at its strongest when directed towards their brother, as he was the driving force that kept them persisting until they found him, their love also extended towards their friends, whom they were always willing to help or assist in whatever way they could whenever their friends were vulnerable, endangered or conflicted, which, in turn, resulted in Jacob's sibling developing an exceedingly compassionate nature. Their compassion even enabled them to sympathise with those whom they were initially antagonistic with, such as [[Merula Snyde]], [[Barnaby Lee]], and [[Ismelda Murk]].\n*'''Indomitable willpower''': The will of Jacob's sibling was extremely strong, and while not above self-doubt, they have never been known to give up on anything or anyone, tirelessly seeking the [[Cursed Vaults]] for the sake of [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|their brother]]. Their willpower gave them great courage, enough to stand in the face of [[Merula Snyde|Merula]]'s antics, [[Severus Snape|Snape]]'s cruelty, and [[Fenrir Greyback|Greyback]]'s murderous intent.\n{{Quote|You truly do have a gift for Charms.|[[Filius Flitwick]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Jacob's sibling was known to be exceptionally skilled in charm-work, as they achieved either an \"[[Exceeds Expectations]]\" or \"[[Outstanding]]\" on their O.W.L. exam to be able to advance to N.E.W.T.-level Charms.<ref name=\"HM61c\" /> In their very first lesson, they cast the best [[Wand-Lighting Charm]] that Professor Flitwick had seen from a first-year in a long time. They were usually the first to master any new spell Professor Flitwick taught (such as the [[Disarming Charm]], the [[Levitation Charm]], and the [[Unlocking Charm]]) with little difficulty, and by their second year, they were capable of casting the [[Shrinking Charm]] to such an effect that they became the size of an insect and thus, virtually invisible to the naked eye. They could also just as easily reverse the effect with an [[Engorgement Charm]] without experiencing any side effects. During class, Professor Flitwick would often commend them for their 'fine technique' and even request that they assist him in demonstrating how to cast spells properly for their fellow classmates, as well as tutouring classmates in various spells. By their fourth year, they produced a [[Shield Charm]] that was strong enough to deflect a [[Blasting Curse]] from the much older and more experienced Patricia Rakepick, visibly impressing her. They even performed an advanced [[Memory Charm]] to erase the [[memory]] of Merula Snyde when she overhead important information about [[Talbott Winger]] in their third year. Jacob's sibling was also able to cast a [[Levitation Charm]] so powerful that it made themself levitate mid-air during their fourth year. Furthermore, they learned how to conjure a fully-corporeal [[Patronus Charm]] by their fourth year, an outstanding feat for a Hogwarts student. Indeed, the [[Charms Master]] himself openly acknowledged Jacob's sibling to be one of his most talented students. Outside of class, they notably tutored [[Skye Parkin]], in return for her training in [[Quidditch]] techniques while planning to try out for their [[Quidditch team#Hogwarts Quidditch teams|House Quidditch team]].\n{{Quote|You continue to exhibit a gift for Potions.|[[Severus Snape]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n*'''[[Potion]]s''': Jacob's sibling was superbly talented in potion-making, as they achieved an \"[[Outstanding]]\" on their O.W.L. exam<ref>During his tenure as [[Potions Master]], [[Severus Snape]] only accepted students who achieved an \"[[Outstanding]]\" on their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] into his [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level [[Potions (class)|Potions classes]]. Since Jacob's sibling was able to advance to N.E.W.T.-level Potions, they must have canonically achieved an \"Outstanding\" in their O.W.L. exam.</ref> to be able to advance to the N.E.W.T.-level [[Potions (class)|Potions]] class taught by Severus Snape,<ref name=\"HM63p\" /> thus displaying their great proficiency for potion-making. They were able to brew everything from basic to moderately difficult concoctions to the desired effect, notably brewing a [[Fire-Breathing Potion]] flawlessly after only seeing the [[Potions Master]] do it once. Indeed, despite his personal dislike of the student, [[Severus Snape]] himself admitted that this individual had an undeniable gift for potions and [[Penny Haywood]], arguably the best student of the subject, praised Jacob's sibling's talent in potion-making, going so far as to suggest that they consider a career as a [[Potioneer]].\n[[File:Jacob's sibling Disarming Merula Snyde.gif|220px|thumb|Jacob's sibling [[Disarming Charm|Disarming]] [[Merula Snyde]]]]\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': Jacob's sibling quickly became a formidable duellist for their age, outclassing the likes of the more experienced Merula Snyde and even [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], both of whom were of one of the most skilled students at Hogwarts, with the latter having two years of education over them. Though usually coming out triumphant in most duels against their peers, they were unable to beat [[Ben Copper]] in a duel to the death, who trounced them but was quickly defeated when Patricia Rakepick came for the rescue, striking him with a [[Blasting Curse]]. This individual's skills were already so great by their first year that they could even hold off [[Fenrir Greyback]] while he was in his werewolf form, with some swift spell-casting. By their fifth year, they were able to out-duel a Dark Witch in Knockturn Alley, despite being there for the first time and defeated an adult wizard named [[Alistair Fidgen]], when he threatened their friend [[Jae Kim]]. However, they were no match for Patricia Rakepick, as she easily subdued them before they could even cast a spell in their fifth year and again when they attempted to attack her in their sixth year. They also acknowledged the vast gap between them and [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], noting that it would be suicide for them to try to infiltrate his office. This individual was able to out-duel the more experienced [[Peter Pettigrew]] after he revealed himself to them. Their duelling aptitude was also clearly staggering in that they were capable of facing and subduing some of the most dangerous beasts in the world, notably being capable enough to overpower the [[Forest Vault Acromantula]] (with even the formidable [[Rubeus Hagrid]] being seemingly unwilling to contend with the beast), to single-handedly defeat a [[Hungarian Horntail]] (with even the incredibly powerful [[Patricia Rakepick]] being incapable of performing such a feat during her youth, despite having received assistance from accomplices) and to hold off the incredibly savage [[Chimaera]] long enough for others to come to their rescue on more than one occasion. By their sixth year, they were even able to contend with [[Alastor Moody]], who was considered to be the most famous [[Auror]] of all time and an extremely skilled duellist, in a duel training with him. Although they themselves acknowledged that Moody wasn't fighting seriously, which Moody himself admitted as he was only trying to assess their skills, Moody still acknowledged their duelling prowess, even going so far as to say that they could give some of his Aurors difficulty in besting them. Their duelling skills improved considerably by the time they ventured into the [[Sunken Vault]], as they managed to single handedly defeat the extremely talented and dangerous [[Patricia Rakepick]] with a powerful [[Disarming Charm]] after she defeated Merula Snyde, Ben Copper and Jacob, and surprised, acknowledged that their skills improved since the last time they met. By their seventh year, this individual received [[Auror]] field training in the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] under [[Alastor Moody]]'s supervision, which helped further improve their duelling skills. They were able to defeat [[Zenith Xeep]] in a [[Skirmish in Knockturn Alley (1990\u20131991)|duel]] in [[Knockturn Alley]], forcing her to drink her own [[Xeep's Luscious Locks Solution|Luscious Locks Solution]], which erased her entire memory, in order to avoid getting captured and giving them information about the [[Garrick Ollivander's stolen wand|stolen wand]] and the [[Dark Witch from Knockturn Alley|Dark Witch]] she was talking to. Their ability to fight both skilled duellists and dark wizards showed them to have considerable proficiency in [[martial magic]].\n{{Quote|You were born to fly.|[[Rolanda Hooch]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n{{Quote|You're a Quidditch phenom.|[[Murphy McNully]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Jacob's sibling's flying skills were exceptional, beyond the array of aerial manoeuvres taught in Flying class. They were also a very skilled [[Quidditch]] player, joining their house's team as Chaser initially in their second year. Showing natural courage, instincts, agility and stamina, they convinced [[Skye Parkin]] to coach them. Some of their most impressive feats on a broomstick range from balancing one-legged on a broom for nearly three hours, to weaving through three opposing Chasers while broom-surfing with incredible reflexes and dexterity.\n*'''Charisma''': Jacob's sibling was highly talented in befriending and inspiring others, such that they were able to quickly form many strong friendships and even befriend people that were hostile towards them.\n*'''Leadership skills''': Jacob's sibling was shown to be a very accomplished and talented leader, as they were able to found and effectively lead the [[Circle of Khanna]] against [[R]], productively coordinating the group's efforts and inspiring fierce loyalty from them all.\n*'''[[Curse-Breaker]]''': Like Bill Weasley, this individual was a gifted curse-breaker, even when it was due to the urgency to find Jacob. This individual was able to unlock the secrets behind the Cursed Vaults.\n{{Quote|You have a talent for solving mysteries.|[[Albus Dumbledore]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n*'''Detective skills''': Jacob's sibling had tremendous skills in tracking and detection, since they tracked down their brother [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] to the [[Buried Vault|Portrait Vault]] after years of skilfully employing both inductive and deductive reasoning in their dogged pursuit of the [[Cursed Vaults]], outsmarting the [[Auror]]s and the [[professor]]s that had investigated the Vaults prior to Jacob's sibling's arrival at Hogwarts.\n*'''Teaching skills''': Jacob's sibling was an excellent teacher of Charms, as they often tutored struggling students. This was even acknowledged by Professor Flitwick and Professor Tofty.\n{{Quote|Your skill in Transfiguration belies your years.|[[Minerva McGonagall]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Jacob's sibling demonstrated considerable talent in transfiguration, as they achieved either an \"[[Exceeds Expectations]]\" or \"[[Outstanding]]\" on their O.W.L. exam to be able to study the subject further at N.E.W.T.-level.<ref name=\"HM61t\" /> They succeeded in casting the best [[Reparifarge]] spell (an [[untransfiguration]] spell) on their first try, impressing even Professor [[Minerva McGonagall]] with their talent, who deemed their abilities in transfiguration to belay their years. As a matter of fact, McGonagall was so impressed that she even offered to give this individual advanced transfiguration lessons outside the class. Jacob's sibling was also able to learn the intermediate level [[Revelio Charm]] (normally taught to [[Fourth year|fourth-year]] students) by their [[second year]]. Indeed, their skill in this subject was so advanced that already before graduating, they were able to become a fully-fledged [[Animagus]], with immense dedication and hard work.<ref name=\"Animagus\"/>\n*'''[[Herbology]]''': By their own admission, one of Jacob's sibling's favourite classes was Herbology, with them being able to achieve an O.W.L. on the subject and study it further at N.E.W.T.-level,<ref name=\"HM62h\"/> thus demonstrating their proficiency for the magical field. They were knowledgeable in various types of magical plants and were also able to successfully grow a perfect specimen of [[Sugar Shrub]] in their third year, remarking that whoever drank Butterbeer made with this was in for a \"sugar shock\", thus showcasing their impressive talent in this subject.\n*'''[[Quidditch]] knowledge''': Jacob's sibling confessed to [[Andre Egwu]] that they were knowledgeable in Quidditch, despite not playing the sport themselves until second year, during which they gained more knowledge with help from [[Penny Haywood]], and possibly even passed the [[Face Paint Kid]]'s [[Face Paint Kid's patented Quidditch Quiz|Knowledge Quiz]].\n*'''[[Wizard's Chess]]''': Jacob's sibling had some talent in Wizard's Chess, as they even impressed Professor McGonagall with their ability.\n{{Quote|You have a way with patients.|[[Poppy Pomfrey]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n*'''[[Healing magic]]''': After taking care of an injured [[Rowan Khanna|Rowan]], Jacob's sibling became an assistant of [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]], and studied healing magic on their own, who would eventually denote them as a natural Healer and an exceptional assistant, to the point of beginning to wonder if Jacob's sibling might eventually proceed her in being responsible for the [[Hospital Wing]] one day, which certainly highlighted their skill and knowledge in medical magic. They were proficient with the casting of the [[Healing spell]] ''[[Episkey]] ''as well as the [[Bandaging Charm]].\n{{Quote|Yeh got a way with creatures.|[[Rubeus Hagrid]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': Jacob's sibling was shown to possess a natural flair for Care of Magical Creatures, being able to achieve an O.W.L. on the subject and study it further at N.E.W.T.-level<ref name=\"HM63cmc\"/>, thus showcasing their talent for handling and [[Communicating with animals|communicating]] with various magical [[creature]]s, along with the understanding of them. This individual began taking this class in their third year of Hogwarts education, and was known to have been rather good in the subject, showing their interest and skill in the field of [[Magizoology]]. Indeed, [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]], one of the best students of the subject, commended Jacob's sibling's flair for tending to magical creatures, going so far as to suggest that they consider a career as a [[Magizoologist]]. \n*'''[[History of Magic]]''': Jacob's sibling was skilled in History of Magic, as they were able to achieve an O.W.L. in the subject and study it further at N.E.W.T.-level.,<ref name=\"HM62hm\"/> an impressive achievement, given the subject's infamy for being exceedingly dull. [[Ismelda Murk]], one of the best students of the subject, recognised Jacob's sibling's knowledge in magical history, going so far as to suggest that they consider a career as a Magical Historian.\n*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': When they were tutored, alongside the rest of their year, by the famous [[Patricia Rakepick]], in Defence Against the Dark Arts, Jacob's sibling soon became the best student of the subject, seamlessly mastering [[Salvio hexia|Hex Deflection]] and proving quite adept in repelling the dark creatures of the lessons. Rakepick herself praised their abilities in this field, with them having achieved either an '[[Exceeds Expectations]] or '[[Outstanding]]' on their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] exam to be able to study the subject further at [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level.<ref name=\":0\" /> They also successfully learned many defensive and offensive spells during their DADA education, including spells taught by their classmates. For an example of their defensive skills, in their [[Third year]], they were successfully able to subdue a [[Boggart]] in the form of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] with the [[Boggart-Banishing Spell]]. Indeed, [[Alastor Moody]], arguably the greatest Auror of all time, expressed his pride in Jacob's sibling, praising them for their Auror-like mindset while [[Nymphadora Tonks]], who would later grow up to become a successful [[Auror]], suggested that Jacob's sibling consider the career, given that they had experience hunting down [[Dark Wizard|Dark wizards]] and clearly displayed familiarity with the job and training. \n*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Though seldom a practitioner of the Dark Arts, Jacob's sibling was nonetheless surprisingly adept in its usage, being able to successfully cast a vast array of [[dark charm]]s, such as the [[hex]] ''[[Densaugeo]]'', the [[Sea Urchin Jinx]], the [[Knockback Jinx]], ''[[Langlock]]'', the [[Curse of the Bogies]], the [[Ear-Shrivelling Curse]], the [[Jelly-Legs Curse]], the [[Conjunctivitis Curse]], the [[Reductor Curse]] and the [[Blasting Curse]]. They were, however, horrified when Patricia Rakepick used the [[Cruciatus Curse]] on a Dark Wizard in [[Knockturn Alley]], rejecting her offer to teach the curse to them and adamantly refusing to ever use it on anyone.\n*'''Singing skills''': Jacob's sibling was a surprisingly skilled singer, as when singing with [[Tulip Karasu]]'s toad [[Dennis (toad)|Dennis]] in front of a variety of listeners, their skills were sufficient enough to be acknowledged by the popular music band the [[Weird Sisters]], [[Choir Master]] [[Filius Flitwick]] and even the callous [[Severus Snape]]. Indeed, despite the relatively short time that they had to begin honing their singing capabilities, they already proved themselves to surpass the singing prowess of the more experienced [[Merula Snyde]]. As such, Jacob's sibling put on such an impressive showing to Flitwick during their audition to be the newest member of the Frog Choir, that Tulip deemed their performance to be the best out of all the participants, which was ultimately proven true when Flitwick offered them exclusive membership into the [[Frog Choir]].\n*'''Dancing skills''': Jacob's sibling had some skills in dancing, as they learned the [[Badger Shuffle]] and used it to win the [[Team Dance Contest]] with [[Diego Caplan]]. They also participated in several balls organised by the school, such as the [[Celestial Ball]] and the [[Valentine's Day Ball]].\n*'''Artistic skills''': Jacob's sibling had some artistic skills, as they helped Badeea Ali paint for the Valentine's Day Ball.\n*'''Cooking skills''': Jacob's sibling had some cooking skills, as they proved to be capable of making food that even pleased Madam Pince and Professor Snape.\n*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal]] and [[Wandless magic]]''': Jacob's sibling was apparently quite capable in casting nonverbal spells, as they subdued a [[Hungarian Horntail]] using the [[Sleeping Charm]], duelled against [[Patricia Rakepick]] in the [[Buried Vault|Portrait Vault]] and later again in the [[Forest Grove]], all without uttering a word. They also demonstrated impressive wandless magic when using the [[Butterfly-conjuring spell]] during their imitation of the [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]] dance routine, a performance that [[Olympe Maxime|Madame Maxime]] ultimately deemed magnificent. They performed [[wandless magic]] when they were young, shattering one of their mother's tea sets when they sneezed. Their mother thought Jacob had done it until they repeated the feat with a vase a few weeks later when Jacob was at school. On another occasion, they laughed a flower back to life.\n*'''[[Legilimency]]''': This individual was a natural-born and powerful Legilimens, like their brother Jacob, thus giving them the magical ability to read and navigate the minds of others. They have successfully used this power against [[Argus Filch]], [[Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]], and several of the [[Hogwarts house-elves]], but were repelled by [[Severus Snape|Snape]]. They also lacked any facility with [[Occlumency]] and were thus unable to defend themselves from mental intrusion.\n*'''[[Spell creation]]''': Jacob's sibling helped [[Badeea Ali]] invent the [[Star Shower Spell]] and [[Maxima|designed]] the [[Snowfall spell]] to such potency by themselves that they inadvertently created a [[Blizzard at Hogwarts|snowstorm]].

In the \"Valentine's Day Ball\" adventure in Year 5, a total of 8 people asked Jacob's sibling out. It proves the point even further than this case.-->\n{{Dialogue a-b-c-d-e-f|Barnaby|I asked someone special but they haven't answered yet...|Penny|Yes, same here...|Andre|I've invited someone special too, but I haven't heard back...|Talbott|There's only one person I'd go with.

Later they may have gone on full dates with some of their friends.\n{{Cleanup}}\n\n===Family===\n{{Dialogue a-b|Jacob|Thank you for not giving up on me.|Jacob's sibling|I could have never given up on you. You're my older brother.|[[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] and his younger sibling, after reuniting.|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n[[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] was this individual's older brother. It is implied that they had a rather close and affectionate relationship with him during their early childhood, as they pretended to duel with [[Liquorice Wand]]s with Jacob when they were younger and even stole [[Sickle]]s from their mother's coat pockets at his behest. When Jacob came home after his [[first year]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], he tried to teach them all the magic he learned at Hogwarts, of which they were unable to perform any of it, but it remained one of the three possibilities of their happiest memory used to cast the [[Patronus Charm]]. After Jacob went mysteriously missing following his expulsion from Hogwarts, his younger sibling was left devastated and mourned his disappearance with their mother. When assaulted by a [[Dementor]], they are forced to relive their worst memory: their mother sobbing uncontrollably upon learning Jacob's disappearance.\n\nJacob's disappearance also had major repercussions on his sibling outside of [[Jacob's family|family]] tragedy. Due to his morbid obsession with the [[Cursed Vaults]], subsequent expulsion and apparent initiation into the [[Death Eaters]], Jacob inadvertently established a rather infamous reputation and was perceived as insane by the wizarding world. Being of his kin, his younger sibling, too, was largely viewed by suspicion, distrust and even hate (with [[Severus Snape|Snape]] and [[Merula Snyde|Merula]] being among their biggest detractors), which thus affected their early years of schooling and ability to make a first good impression on people. Despite all this, however, Jacob's sibling never felt bitter or resentful towards the negative publicity that they received, caused by their brother, and continued to feel nothing but unconditional love for Jacob. Their early years at Hogwarts was marked by agony over the mysterious whereabouts of their brother, thus leading them to resolve to find and rescue him no matter what.\n\nIndeed, this strong, unconditional love for their brother became their primary point of obsession with seeking the [[Cursed Vaults]], inciting them to sometimes behave recklessly and enact dangerous schemes in their goal to save Jacob, such as igniting the cloak of a member of faculty and fighting a troll in the Hogwarts grounds. They would also defend Jacob's honour against accusations and mockery when necessary, refusing to believe the perpetuated rumour that he was insane and had joined the [[Death Eaters]].\n\nAfter finally rescuing and reuniting their brother in [[1989]], Jacob's sibling was shown to be incredibly relieved and happy at seeing their brother safe and sound.\n\n===The Weasleys===\n====Bill Weasley====\n[[File:HM friendships Bill Weasley (with Prefect badge).png|150px|thumb|left|[[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], one of their best friends]]\nJacob's sibling admired [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], but not as much as [[Rowan Khanna]] did. The two became close allies because of how much they had in common and were both very helpful to each other when it came to martial magic.\n\n====Charlie Weasley====\n[[File:Charles.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]], one of their best friends]]\nJacob's sibling presumably better familiarised themselves with [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]] in their [[third year]] of Hogwarts, during which they shared [[Care of Magical Creatures]] with him. Their friendship with him evolved to such that Charlie offered to talk down the imperious [[Merula Snyde]] on their behalf during their [[fourth year]].\n\n===Friends===\n====Rowan Khanna====\nJacob's sibling met [[Rowan Khanna]] at Diagon Alley. The two became best friends at school. They both bonded over the fact that both of them did not truly have anyone else going into Hogwarts &mdash; Jacob's sibling was regarded as insane thanks to their brother's actions, and Rowan was socially inept and mostly talked about trees. They continuously helped each other get through both everyday and life-threatening situations. When Rowan died, they were devastated, and it was hard for them to get over the loss.\n\n====Ben Copper====\n[[File:HM_friendships_Ben_Copper.png|150px|thumb|left|[[Ben Copper]], one of their best friends]]\nJacob's sibling was quite friendly with [[Ben Copper]], although not as close as Rowan. They cared deeply for his well-being, as they became very worried when he went missing, and showed their loyalty to him by infiltrating [[Gryffindor Tower]] merely because it may or may not lead to him. They also helped Ben to get over his fear of flying.\n\n====Penny Haywood====\n[[File:Penny.png|150px|thumb|right|[[Penny Haywood]], one of their best friends]]\n{{Dialogue a-b|Penny Haywood|Thank you again for all of your help. I can't imagine what life would be like without you.|Jacob's sibling|I feel the same way, Penny. I'll always be here for you.|Penny Haywood and Jacob's sibling|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\nJacob's sibling admired [[Penny Haywood]] for her popularity, kindness, and overall competence. She treated them cordially, but they got her attention by standing up to Merula Snyde. They brewed a potion together to neutralise Mrs Norris. Penny was grateful for Jacob's sibling putting her in a life-threatening situation, as she loved excitement more than they did. She always seemed to know what was going on at Hogwarts, which made her very useful as well. They were surprised when she was close to [[Talbott Winger]].\n\n====Nymphadora Tonks====\n[[File:HM_friendships_Nymphadora_Tonks.png|150px|thumb|left|[[Nymphadora Tonks]], one of their best friends]]\nJacob's sibling and [[Nymphadora Tonks]] met in their first year at Hogwarts, and shared [[Herbology]] class together. Over the course of the next couple of years, they grew close and became best friends, often going to [[Hogsmeade]] to visit [[Zonko's Joke Shop]] in particular in order to plan their pranks together.\n\n====Barnaby Lee====\n[[File:Barnaby Lee.png|150px|thumb|right|[[Barnaby Lee]], one of their best friends]]\nJacob's sibling initially had an antagonistic relationship with [[Barnaby Lee]] because of his loyalty to Merula and his threats to them. However, they began getting along better when Barnaby joined their side and Merula later did the same, and when they helped him when [[Ismelda Murk]] tried to drug him via [[Love Potion]]. He also said Jacob's sibling was very polite and brave and looked adorable when they rolled their eyes in response to his puns and when they discussed animals and ruefully used [[Engorgement Charm]]s on his drinks at [[Hogsmeade]], though he was under magical effects when he said it.\n\n====Talbott Winger====\n{{Quote|I never thought I'd be happy to meet someone who can never mind their own business.|Talbott Winger|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n[[File:Talbott_Winger.png|150px|thumb|left|[[Talbott Winger]], one of their best friends]]\nJacob's sibling first met [[Talbott Winger]] when looking to become an [[Animagus]]. They were surprised to learn he was close to [[Penny Haywood]]. They did not, however, become friends until they located Talbott's [[Talbott Winger's swan necklace|swan necklace]] and took it back from [[Mrs Norris]].\n\n====Andre Egwu====\n[[File:Andre Egwu.png|150px|thumb|right|[[Andre Egwu]], one of their best friends]]\n[[Andre Egwu]] attended [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] and [[Flying (class)|Flying]] classes with Jacob's sibling, although the two didn't know each other a lot and only regarded the other as a classmate. When Jacob's sibling ventured out to [[Hogsmeade]] for the first time, Andre properly introduced himself to them and expressed his gratitude for them breaking the [[cursed ice]] that had encased him in the [[Quidditch Changing Rooms]], thus unknowingly saving his life.\n\n====Tulip Karasu====\n[[File:Tulip Karasu.png|150px|thumb|left|[[Tulip Karasu]], a good friend]]\nJacob's sibling got along with [[Tulip Karasu]] and they teamed up seeking the Cursed Vaults. Although Tulip had in fact betrayed Merula for a better chance at actually finding the vaults, she later came to regret this and Jacob's sibling helped to ease her guilt, with Merula working with them both in the future. In spite of this, Tulip was surprised that Jacob's sibling did not have a grudge against Merula or distrust her entirely.\n\n====Skye Parkin====\n[[File:SkyeParkin.png|150px|thumb|right|[[Skye Parkin]], a good friend]]\nJacob's sibling bonded with [[Skye Parkin]] over their shared passion for Quidditch, though they were annoyed with her zealous attitude. Both of them were able to work effectively together as two units on the same team over a common objective of winning the [[House Cup]].\n\n====Murphy McNully====\nJacob's sibling bonded with [[Murphy McNully]] over their shared passion for Quidditch, though they were annoyed with his excessive talking. Both of them were able to work effectively together as two units on the same team over a common objective of winning the [[House Cup]].\n\n====Orion Amari====\nJacob's sibling bonded with [[Orion Amari]] over their shared passion for Quidditch, though they were annoyed with his old-fashioned, almost medieval rhetoric. Both of them were able to work effectively together as two units on the same team over a common objective of winning the [[House Cup]].\n\n===Others===\n====Merula Snyde====\n{{Quote|There are so many things at Hogwarts you're not smart enough to understand, ''[Jacob's sibling]''. Trying to uncover those things is going to get you killed...|Merula Snyde|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n[[File:Merula_Snyde_Headshot.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Merula Snyde]], their arch-rival and enemy turned ally]]\n[[Merula Snyde]] became the archrival of Jacob's sibling almost immediately upon arriving at Hogwarts. Merula came from a supremacist family and desired to surpass all others, thus she considered herself superior to virtually everyone. She bullied Jacob's sibling for allegedly being cursed, though they did not truly hate Merula and merely wished she would leave them alone. They first met when Merula tried to force [[Rowan Khanna]] into claiming she was the most powerful witch in the [[wizarding world]], and she baffled them by already knowing who they were. Jacob's sibling learned she was born of two [[Death Eaters]], and while it made them realise why she was a bully, it did not soften their mutual enmity at all.\n\nThey were forced to resort to violence when Merula antagonised them and again when she antagonised [[Ben Copper]]. During their first round, Merula bested them with a [[Trip Jinx]], but they bested her the second time via the [[Disarming Charm]]. They were forced to challenge her a third time in their second year, and while Merula agreed to no more duelling, she refused to stay off his tail. They were also enemies because they both sought to find the [[Cursed Vaults]], albeit for different reasons. When Jacob's sibling arrived with [[Rowan Khanna]] and another friend, she used the Trip Jinx against all three of them, confusing Jacob's sibling who did not understand why she wanted to solve the mystery as much as he did. She believed they were going to meet a sticky end someday.\n\nDespite being enemies, they began getting along better when [[Patricia Rakepick]] recruited the both of them as apprentices.\n\n====Ismelda Murk====\n[[File:Ismelda Murk HM.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Ismelda Murk]], their enemy turned ally]]\n[[Ismelda Murk]] used to despise Jacob's sibling for the threat they posed to Merula's chances of finding the Cursed Vaults, but after they helped her resolve her enmity with Erika Rath and her obsession with Barnaby Lee, their relationship grew less hostile. \n\n===Hogwarts staff===\n{{Quote|The only thing I value less than you, [surname], is your apology. Sit down.|Severus Snape|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\n[[File:TeachersHM.png|200px|thumb|left|Members of Hogwarts staff this student had noteworthy relations with]]\nJacob's sibling generally had a positive relationship with the staff at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], who were all impressed by their academic prowess. However, they were also looked at with apprehension because of Jacob, and was looked at with particular apprehension for their wrongdoings. They generally got along with [[Filius Flitwick]], though he hesitated teaching them the [[Trip Jinx]]. They also had a good relationship with [[Rubeus Hagrid]] and frequently came to his rescue. Their worst relationship, inevitably, was with [[Severus Snape]], who always treated them with contempt and frequently looked for reasons to take House Points from them. He was never fair with them either, such as when he gave them a single point for making a better potion than [[Merula Snyde]], whom he pretended to like when he actually despised her. Their best relationship was of course with [[Albus Dumbledore]], who openly acknowledged their magical prowess to be exemplary and treated them with nothing but respect and kindness and none of the apprehension the other staff members did for their wrongdoings and actually expressed sympathy for them, to the point where he even gave them House Points for saving Hogwarts from three of the curses of the Cursed Vaults. Even though Dumbledore could get stern and firm with Jacob's sibling, it was for their own good and apart from punishing them to constant detentions with Pitts, he had defended them from practically all of the staff's criticism.\n\n====Patricia Rakepick====\n[[File:Patricia Rakepick - Hogwarts Mystery.png|150px|thumb|right|[[Patricia Rakepick]], a hated enemy]]\nPresumably well aware of the events that lead to the [[Discipline at Hogwarts#Expulsion|expulsion]] of former Hogwarts student [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] long before she ever met his younger sibling, given her own interest in the vaults, [[Patricia Rakepick]] took interest in the latter individual for their first-hand experience with the Cursed Vaults, and is known to have kept an eye on them, possibly even before she was invited back to Hogwarts by the Headmaster of the day, Albus Dumbledore, to help put the threat of the Cursed Vaults to rest. Though she did not waste any time soliciting the help of said student and their group of friends to make her own, sanctioned search for the vaults easier, and even assured Jacob's sibling she meant them no harm and even were investigating the identity of the [[Ben Copper|mysterious wizard]] that had attacked them in the [[Clock Tower Courtyard]] after curfew by forging a letter with the handwriting of Silvanus Kettleburn. Severus Snape, however, the Potions Master and former schoolmate of Rakepick's, did not trust her at all, going so far as to saying she had ulterior motives for being at Hogwarts and that she was after the Cursed Vaults for her own gain, and quite possibly meant to kill both them and anyone else who stood in her way. Rakepick continued, however, to request the assistance of Jacob's sibling, teaching them the [[Shield Charm]] to test their abilities and, getting impressive results, continued to offer guidance, such as lending them [[Sickleworth|her own]] [[Niffler]] to help in the search for clues and eventually teaching them the [[Arania Exumai|Spider repelling spell]] in order to prepare them for a potential fight with Acromantulas. \n\nIn the end, however, Snape's suspicions were proven partially correct when she fooled Jacob's sibling into breaking into the [[Room 234-00|office]] of [[Argus Filch]] for a wild goose chase, only to swoop in and retrieve something she herself had been looking for. This eventually left Jacob's sibling uncertain if Rakepick can be trusted or if they were playing right into the hand of their potential enemy. Rakepick did redeem herself for her indiscretions, however, when she saved the life of Jacob's sibling by coming to their rescue just as their attacker was about to deliver the ''coup de grace'', casting a [[Blasting Curse]] so powerful that the attacker was blasted backwards, across almost the whole length of the [[Clock Tower Courtyard|Clocktower Courtyard]] and into a wall, knocking them out cold. Upon undoing the [[Disillusionment Charm]] the attacker was under, they discovered that the person in question was [[Ben Copper]], whom Rakepick transported back into the castle to prevent him from hurting himself or others while Jacob's sibling went after the Forest Vault.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:JacobsSiblingTrailer.png|150px|thumb|The player character as they appear in the promotional trailer]]\n[[File:JacobsSiblingQuidditchTrailer.jpg|150px|thumb|The player character as they appear in the Quidditch trailer]]\n[[File:Penny Haywood, Barnaby Lee and Jacob's sibling HM BackToHogwarts Trailer.png|150px|thumb|The player character as they appear in the BackToHogwarts trailer]]\n[[File:Penny Haywood and Jacob's sibling HM BackToHogwarts Trailer.png|150px|thumb|The player character as they appear in the BackToHogwarts trailer]]\n*This individual is the protagonist of {{HM}}. Name, surname, gender, [[Hogwarts Houses|House]] and physical appearance are chosen by the player. The wand material also varies based on the player's goals and personality traits. Jacob's sibling's relationships, personality and choices may vary significantly depending on the player's decisions.\n**Even though the House is one of the factors chosen by the player, rivalry with [[Merula Snyde]] still occurs even if the individual is picked to be with Slytherin.\n**[[Rowan Khanna]]'s gender and House is always the same as Jacob's sibling's.\n**[[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Their brother]], [[Orion Amari]], [[Skye Parkin]], [[Ethan Parkin]], [[Murphy McNully]], [[Face Paint Kid]], and [[Elora Dunn]] are always in the same House as Jacob's sibling's.\n**[[Erika Rath]] is a Ravenclaw unless Jacob's sibling is in Ravenclaw, in which case she would be a Slytherin.\n**[[Corey Hayden]] is male if Jacob's sibling is female and vice versa.\n*The character's gender and house cannot be altered once set. The character's name, apperance, and out-of-class clothing may be altered at any time using the character customisation screen. Like all students, they automatically wear standard robes in class or, if they become a [[prefect]] in their fourth year, wear robes with a [[prefect badge]] in class.\n*The character's [[wand]] is set at the start of the game, with Jacob's sibling visiting [[Diagon Alley]] to get their [[Jacob's sibling's first wand|first wand]] before their first year, and again in fifth year to get a [[Jacob's sibling's second wand|replacement wand]]. In both cases, their choice of wand is determined by the answer to a question that [[Garrick Ollivander|Ollivander]] asks the character.\n*According to {{PS}}, Slytherin had won the [[House Cup]] the six years before [[Gryffindor]]'s win in [[Harry Potter]]'s first year, [[1992]] (in [[1986]] through [[1991]]). The fact that this individual's House is player-determined and that they are able to help their House win the [[House Cup]] can potentially cause a contradiction to the established [[canon]] of the books, by having another House win the Cup in those school year, meaning that either canonically Jacob's sibling was a Slytherin, or messing with the Cursed Vaults cost them the House Cup for six years in a row.\n*After the \"Meet the Malfoys\" side quest, Jacob's sibling can befriend [[Dobby]] which potentially contradicts canon where Dobby said no wizard had treated him as an equal, although technically Jacob's sibling may have been a witch and indeed is one in almost all promotional content.\n*As Jacob's sibling, you can also become an [[Animagus]]; depending on how you answer Penny's question, you can become a [[cat]], a [[dog]], or a [[bird]]. This can be done through a time-limited Animagus side quest, during which you can learn the ability and convince [[Talbott Winger]] to register with the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. However, in the Flying Solo side quest, they are both unregistered as of Year 3, both have concerns about being found by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and Death Eaters, even if Jacob's sibling can decide to voluntarily register at a later date.\n[[File:Penny mentioning Maya.png|150px|thumb|[[Penny Haywood|Penny]] mentions the name '''Maya''' in [https://youtu.be/27OiVEaAaoM official launch trailer] of {{HM}}]]\n*In the [https://youtu.be/27OiVEaAaoM?t=41s official launch trailer] of the game, [[Penny Haywood]] says, \"Thanks, '''Maya!''' I know this plan is going to work.\" From this, we can assume that either the original name of this character is Maya, or that Maya is only a name set by the developers of the trailer.\n*[https://gizmosite.tv/project/harry-potter-hogwarts-mystery-emmas-journey/ Gizmo], which produces the cinematic trailers (with the brown-skinned, short dark haired Hufflepuff girl as Jacob's sibling), labels her as \"Emma\".\n*In the [[1984\u20131985 school year]], Jacob's sibling had visions showing Hogwarts covered in ice and an animated suit of armour. Their best friend, [[Rowan Khanna]], said while discussing the vision with them later that \"it appeared to have been some kind of prophecy\", suggesting Jacob's sibling might be a [[Seer]]. Although, since Rowan was only a first-year, they might have been wrong. However, the incident with the [[Cursed ice]] later on hints that Jacob's sibling could indeed be a Seer. Jacob's sibling's later had another vision of two unknown rooms and [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], suggesting that this individual were a Seer. They later also hears brief spoken messages from Jacob in their mind, both of which were later revealed to be a result of how both they and Jacob had in common a natural gift in [[Legilimency]], suggesting that Jacob might have used said ability to send them [[vibe]]s, which is a similar but distinct process.\n**Jacob's sibling may also occasionally receive precognitions of what the opponent's next spell would be in duelling.\n*In the Beta mode of the game, there was a character named [[William (Hogwarts student)|William]]. William was meant to be the name of the player's older brother. However, every scene where the name William was mentioned was replaced by the name Jacob in the final cut of the game. It's unknown whether William was intended to be the original name of Jacob or whether he was another character cut from the game.\n[[File:Qat35Lw.jpg|150px|thumb|Male protagonist, created by one of the players]]\n*Although never confirmed, it is heavily implied that the player character is a half-blood, as they are referred to as a Mudblood multiple times by Merula and Rakepick.\n[[File:PhotoEditor 20190216 193323581.jpg|150px|thumb|Female protagonist, created by one of the players]]\n*When playing [[Gobstones]] against Tonks, Jacob's sibling jokes that they might also be a [[Metamorphmagus]], a tongue-in-cheek reference to the fact that the player can change the physical features of the character at any time they want.\n*In the fifth year, you can choose to sit [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] through a side quest. You gain a minimum of seven [[Acceptable]]'s, even if you fail to answer any question or perform any tasks. The maximum number of [[Outstanding]] grades is in the following seven subjects:\n**[[Charms (class)|Charms]]\n**[[Potions (class)|Potions]]\n**[[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]]\n**[[Care of Magical Creatures]]\n**[[Herbology]]\n**[[History of Magic]]\n**[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]\n**[[Divination (class)|Divination]], [[Astronomy]] and [[Muggle Studies]] are never acknowledged in the quest despite the fact that Jacob's sibling had to achieve O.W.L.s in those subjects, as they could study them in the [[Sixth year|sixth]] and [[seventh year]].\n*Jacob's sibling is capable of studying over ten [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] subjects in the game, which seems highly unrealistic in [[canon]]ical terms, considering the massive difficulty of and workload of N.E.W.T. courses, and the fact that [[Hermione Granger]] (a top student in her year) only took seven herself. \n*Jacob's sibling might be bisexual or pansexual since (regardless of selected gender) they have the option of fancying and/or dating male and female characters.\n*Even if they get only an Acceptable on their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] Potions or Transfiguration, they still are allowed into the [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test]] classes in year 6, which contradicts the statements made by [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] and [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] in the canon series. This may not be an error as the curriculum may have been updated after Jacob's sibling's time.\n*Jacob's sibling may have seen someone die before witnessing Rowan's death in sixth year. If the player completes the side quest The Dark Horse (available starting in third year), the character's ability to work with [[Thestral]]s suggests that they can see them.
