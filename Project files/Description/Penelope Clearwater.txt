"{{Individual infobox\n|theme = ravenclaw\n|image = [[File:Pepe4.jpg|250px]]\n|name = Penelope Clearwater\n|born = Between [[1 September]] [[1975]] and [[31 August]] [[1976]]{{fact}}\n|died = \n|blood = [[Muggle-born]] or [[Half-blood]]<ref name=\"bloodstatus\">There is some confusion over Penelope Clearwater's blood status. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]]'', Penelope was [[Petrification|petrified]] along with [[Colin Creevey]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], [[Hermione Granger]], [[Nearly-Headless Nick]], and [[Mrs Norris]]. The petrifications were described as a series of \"four attacks on Muggle-borns\" in {{COS|B|14}} and Ginny Weasley (possessed by [[Tom Riddle's diary|Tom Riddle's memory]]) was described as having \"set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib's cat\" in {{COS|B|17}}. However, it is possible that the fourth Muggle-born in addition to Colin, Hermione, and Justin (who are all definitively identified as Muggle-borns at some point) was Nearly-Headless Nick, and that Penelope was simply petrified because she was with Hermione when she encountered the [[basilisk]]. In {{DH|B|23}}, Hermione posed as Penelope when under interrogation by [[Snatchers]], and claimed to be [[half-blood]]. Although, Hermione may have only lied about Penelope's blood status because mentioning she's Muggle-born would have possibly made things worse.</ref>\n|marital = \n|nationality = {{GBorIE}}\n|alias = Penny (by [[Percy Weasley]])<ref name=\"P13\"/>\n|title = [[Prefect]]<ref name=\"C12\"/>\n|signature = \n|species = [[Human]]<ref name=\"C12\"/>\n|gender = Female<ref name=\"C12\"/>\n|height = \n|weight = \n|hair = \n|eyes = \n|skin = \n|family = \n|romances = [[Percy Weasley]] (ex-boyfriend)<ref name=\"C18\"/>\n|animagus = \n|boggart = [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]<ref name=\"LEGOY1\">{{LEGO|Y1}}</ref>\n|wand = \n|patronus = Non-corporeal<ref name=\"LEGOY2\">{{LEGO|Y2}}</ref>\n|job = \n|house = [[Ravenclaw]]<ref name=\"C12\"/>\n|loyalty = *Clearwater family\n*[[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]<ref name=\"C12\"/>\n**[[Ravenclaw]]<ref name=\"C12\"/>\n}}\n'''Penelope \"Penny\" Clearwater''' (born c.[[1975]] or [[1976]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Ravenclaw]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1987]] to [[1994]]. In her later school years, she was a [[Prefect]], and eventually started dating [[Percy Weasley]], a [[Wizardkind|Gryffindor student]] and a fellow [[Prefect]].<ref name=\"C18\"/> After she finished her education at Hogwarts, Penelope and Percy never married. Percy married another woman named [[Audrey Weasley]] instead.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nPenelope was born in c.[[1975]] or [[1976]] in [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]]. She was either from a [[Non-magic people|muggle]] family or had both muggle and magical heritage.<ref name=\"bloodstatus\" />\n\n===Hogwarts years {{c|1987-1994}}===\n\n====Early years====\nPenelope Clearwater arrived at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1987]]{{fact}} and upon her arrival was [[Sorting Hat|Sorted]] into the [[Hogwarts Houses|House]] of [[Ravenclaw]].\n\n====Sixth year====\n{{Quote|I beg your pardon? Our common room? I'm a Ravenclaw.|Penelope's suspicion at a [[Polyjuice Potion|disguised]] [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]].|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\nIn the summer of [[1992]], [[Percy Weasley]] wrote many letters to her and met up with her in secret throughout the next school year.<ref name=\"C18\">{{COS|B|18}}</ref> At Christmas [[1992]], Penelope was asked for directions by [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], who disguised themselves as [[Vincent Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle]], while they were wandering around looking for the [[Slytherin Dungeon|Slytherin common room]]. She did not trust them and told them that being in Ravenclaw, she could not help them.<ref name=\"C12\">{{COS|B|12}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Petrified.jpg|245px|thumb|left|A petrified Penelope in the hospital wing]]\nIn the same year, the [[Chamber of Secrets]] had been opened, unleashing a \"monster\" that was hunting down [[Muggle-born]] students. [[Hermione Granger]] deduced that it was a [[Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk|basilisk]] and ran into Penelope as she rushed to inform her friends.<ref name=\"C14\">{{COS|B|14}}</ref><ref name=\"C16\">{{COS|B|16}}</ref>\n\nPenelope and Hermione made good use of Penelope's mirror to navigate the school hallways, but they looked the [[basilisk]] in the eye through the reflection of the mirror, [[petrification|petrifying]] them both. Percy was known to be very upset with Penelope's unfortunate petrification.<ref name=\"C14\" /> Penelope was eventually revived with a [[Mandrake Restorative Draught|draught]] prepared from [[Mandrake]] roots, along with Hermione and the other victims.<ref name=\"C18\"/>\n\nBefore the end of the school year, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] walked in on Penelope kissing Percy in an empty classroom. He told her to keep it secret, but she later told on them.<ref name=\"C18\" />\n\n====Seventh year====\nBy the summer of [[1993]], Penelope was still dating Percy who had a picture of her at home. When someone spilt tea on it, Percy was upset and blamed Ron, who said Penelope hid her face because she had a blotchy nose.<ref name=\"P5\">{{POA|B|5}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1993, while on [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters]], Penelope was approached by an excited Percy, wanting to show her the shiny new badge he had for being made Head Boy.<ref name=\"P5\" />\n\nPenelope appeared to be a serious [[Quidditch]] fan, having appreciated [[Harry Potter]]'s new [[broomstick]], a [[Firebolt]], greatly, and betting ten galleons on the outcome of the [[Ravenclaw]] vs [[Gryffindor]] match with Percy. When she wanted to hold the broomstick, Percy heartily told her not to sabotage them by doing so.<ref name=\"P13\">{{POA|B|13}}</ref>\n\nWhen Ravenclaw later lost, Percy congratulated Harry and then went to find Penelope to receive the ten galleons she owed him.<ref name=\"P13\" /> Penelope later listened to Percy, the only one to do so, when he explained he would make lots of proposals about the Magical Law Enforcement when he could.<ref name=\"P22\">{{POA|B|22}}</ref>\n\nSadly, she did not end up marrying her Hogwarts boyfriend, as Percy eventually married a woman named [[Audrey Weasley|Audrey]] and had two children with her.\n\n==Physical appearance==\nPenelope was described as having long, curly hair.<ref name=\"C12\" />\n\n==Possessions==\n[[File:PenelopeClearwaterMirror.png|thumb|Her personal mirror]]\n*'''[[Wand]]''': Penelope owned a wand, which was of an unknown length, [[wand wood]] and [[Wand core|core]].

When she encountered the [[Serpent of Slytherin]] in [[1993]], the [[Basilisk]]'s deadly gaze was reflected by the mirror's glass and only resulted in her and [[Hermione Granger]] being [[Petrification|petrified]], saving both their lives.<ref name=\"C16\"/>\n*'''[[Prefect badge]]''': Having been a [[Ravenclaw]] [[Prefect]] whilst at Hogwarts, Penelope owned a Ravenclaw Prefect badge, which she would have worn during her official Prefect duties.<ref name=\"C16\"/> \n\n==Relationships==\n===Percy Weasley===\n{{Quote|He's been meeting her all over the school in secret. I walked in on them kissing in an empty classroom one day. He was so upset when she was \u2014 you know \u2014 attacked.

They would meet in deserted classrooms to kiss, but were caught once by Percy's sister, Ginny.<ref name=\"C18\" />\n\nPercy was distraught when Penelope was [[petrification|petrified]] in [[1993]]<ref name=\"C18\" />, and immensely relieved when she was cured by the [[Mandrake Restorative Draught]].<ref name=\"C16\" /> The secret came out when Ginny revealed the truth to her brothers, asking them not to tease Percy over the fact, which they did anyway.<ref name=\"C18\" />\n\nWith the secret out, Percy and Penelope appeared in public together, and he kept a photo of her. During his stay at the [[Leaky Cauldron]] before the start of his seventh year, he accused Ron of dripping tea on it.<ref name=\"P5\" />\n\nPercy was excited to see her on [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters|Platform 9\u00be]], wanting to show her the Head Boy badge he was given<ref name=\"P5\" /> and, later in the year, wagered ten [[Galleon]]s on the outcome of the [[Gryffindor]] vs [[Ravenclaw]] match, despite not actually having ten galleons. He playfully remarked to her about sabotaging Harry's [[Firebolt]] when she asked if she could touch it. He was unafraid of asking Penelope for the ten galleons she later owed him,<ref name=\"P13\" /> while she would be the only who cared to listen to him while he ranted at a later date.<ref name=\"P22\" />\n\nFor unknown reasons, Percy and Penelope did not stay together, and Percy ended up marrying [[Audrey Weasley]].\n\n==Etymology==\n*In ''The Odyssey'', [[Wikipedia:Penelope|Penelope]] was the wife of Odysseus. While he was away fighting the Trojan Wars, she was pursued by many suitors; to hold them off, Penelope told them she would choose one when she finished weaving a shroud, but unravelled her work every night to prevent this from occurring. The poetic sense of the name is a faithful, clever, woman, particularly a wife. It is derived from the Greek words ''pene'', \"web\", and ''\u014dps'', meaning \"eye\" or \"face\", although it is questionable; the name can also mean \"weaver\" or \"duck\".\n*The name is also possibly derived from the Greek name \"penelops\" for a kind of [[duck]] that was said to have rescued and nurtured Penelope when she was exposed to die as an infant.\n*Clearwater is a descriptive place name that suggests her ancestors lived near a body of [[water]] (which could be why her name may mean \"duck\").\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Penelope Clearwater.jpg|thumb|Penelope Clearwater in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]\n*In {{COS|FA}}, Penelope is not a victim of the basilisk, and only appears when she and [[Percy Weasley]] are walking from the [[Great Hall]] during the first day of term, and are met and greeted by [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly Headless Nick]], and later, in the crowd during the [[Duelling Club]]. She is also present at the [[End-of-Term Feast]]. She is played by [[Gemma Padley]].\n*Early printings of ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' make Penelope a [[fifth year]] student, making her a year below Percy. Later printings revise this to make her a [[sixth year]].\n*Despite Penelope graduated from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in [[1994]], she is depicted as a Hogwarts student in {{LEGO|Y2}}, which is set from [[1995]] onwards. This was probably done simply for aesthetic reasons.<ref name=\"LEGOY2\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Penelope Clearwater}}\n[[File:Penelope_Clearwater.png|thumb|Penelope Clearwater in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]\n*{{COS}} {{1st}}\n*{{COS|F}}\n*{{COS|G}} {{Mention}} {{Comment|Mentioned as ''secret girlfriend''}}\n*{{POA}} \n*{{POA|G}} {{Mention}} {{Comment|GBA version only}}\n*{{DH}} {{Mention}}\n*{{DH|F1}} {{Mention}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}}\n*{{PM}}\n*{{WW}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Head boys and prefects}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Clearwater, Penelope}}\n\n[[de:Penelope Clearwater]]\n[[de2:Penelope Clearwater]]\n[[es:Pen\u00e9lope Clearwater]]\n[[it:Penelope Clearwater]]\n[[fr:P\u00e9n\u00e9lope Deauclaire]]\n[[ru:\u041f\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b]]\n[[fi:Penelope Clearwater]]\n[[nl:Patricia Hazelaar]]\n[[pl:Penelopa Clearwater]]\n[[ja:\u30da\u30cd\u30ed\u30d4\u30fc\u30fb\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc]]\n[[Category:1970s births]]\n[[Category:Basilisk victims]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts prefects]]\n[[Category:Impersonated individuals]]\n[[Category:Percy Weasley's romantic relationships]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1987]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
