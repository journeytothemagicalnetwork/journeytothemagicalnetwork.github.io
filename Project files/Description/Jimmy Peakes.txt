[[1983]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and student of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] chosen by [[Harry Potter]] to be one of the new [[Beater]]s for the [[1996\u20131997 school year|1996-1997]] [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. Together with [[Ritchie Coote]] he replaced [[Jack Sloper]] and [[Andrew Kirke]].<ref name=\"HBP11\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n===Hogwarts years===\n====Early years====\nJimmy started his education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1994]]. Upon his arrival at Hogwarts, Jimmy was sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]], a house renowned for bravery. He was three years below the famous [[Harry Potter]].\n\n====Third year====\n{{Quote|Jimmy Peakes, a short but broad-chested third-year boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Harry's head with a ferociously hit Bludger...|Harry Potter's assessment of the new Gryffindor Beaters|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\nIn the [[1996\u20131997 school year]] Jimmy tried out and became the new Beater for Gryffindor in the [[1996\u20131997 school year|1996-1997 Quidditch season]] replacing [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] with [[Ritchie Coote]]. Neither of them gave the team the same charisma, but were almost as good in game. During tryouts Jimmy caused Harry to receive a swelling on his head the size of an egg after hitting him with a Bludger.<ref name=\"HBP11\">{{HBP|B|11}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Gryffindor vs. Hufflepuff match it was mentioned by [[Hermione Granger]] that he and [[Ritchie Coote]] apparently caught Harry after he was knocked out by a Bludger to the head that [[Cormac McLaggen]] accidentally hit to him.<ref name=\"HBP20\">{{HBP|B|20}}</ref>\n\n====Fourth year====\nAfter the death of former [[Headmaster]] Dumbledore, Snape took to the position of Head. The school was corrupt and being ran by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] indirectly with puppet teachers and [[Death Eaters]] [[Amycus Carrow]] and [[Alecto Carrow]] being employed this year. Attendance to Hogwarts was compulsory for all [[Pure-blood]] and [[Half-blood]] students.\n\n====Battle of Hogwarts====\n{{Quote|Absolutely not, Creevey, go!

Peakes did not have the \"old brilliance\" of [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] (whom he and fellow new Beater Ritchie Coote replaced), but during the tryouts, he was strong enough to hit a [[Bludger]] hard enough to cause a lump about the size of an egg on Harry's head.<ref name=\"HBP11\"/>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Having been chosen as a [[Beater]] for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], Peakes was a skilled [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player.<ref name=\"HBP11\"/> \n\n==Appearances==\n*{{HBP}} {{1st}}\n*{{HBP|F}}\n*{{DH}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Peakes, Jimmy}}\n[[de2:Jimmy Peakes]]\n[[de:Jimmy Peakes]]\n[[es:Jimmy Peakes]]\n[[fr:Jimmy Peakes]]\n[[he:\u05d2'\u05d9\u05de\u05d9 \u05e4\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1]]\n[[nl:Jimmy Postelijn]]\n[[pl:Jimmy Peakes]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0436\u0438\u043c\u043c\u0438 \u041f\u0438\u043a\u0441]]\n[[sv:Jimmy Peakes]]\n[[zh:\u5409\u7c73\u00b7\u73c0\u514b\u65af]]\n[[Category:1980s births]]\n[[Category:Beaters]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Peakes family]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1994]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
