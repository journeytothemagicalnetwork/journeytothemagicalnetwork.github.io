[[1981]]/[[1982]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and a [[Gryffindor]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], who started her education in [[1993]]. In [[1996]], she developed an obsessive crush on her fellow Gryffindor [[Harry Potter]] and even gave him [[Love Potion]], which [[Ronald Weasley]] mistakenly ingested.<ref name=\"HBP18\"/> The following year, she became a signed member of [[Dumbledore's Army]] and fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]].<ref name=\"DHF2\"/>\n\nShe survived the final battle of the [[Second Wizarding War]],<ref name=\"DHF2\"/> and much later had a run-in with the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] during the [[2010s]].<ref name=\"WU\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life {{Comment|[[1980s]]}}===\n\nRomilda was born in [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]] in either [[1981]] or [[1982]] into the [[Vane family]].\n\n===Hogwarts years {{Comment|[[1993]]-[[2000]]}}===\n\n====Early years====\nRomilda Vane attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1993]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]] house.<ref name=\"HBP11\"/>\n\n====Fourth year====\n{{Dialogue a-b-c|Girl 1|You ask him!|Girl 2|No, you!|Romilda |I'll do it!|Romilda and her friends arguing about who will ask [[Harry Potter|Harry]] to sit with them|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\nRomilda started her fourth year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in [[1996\u20131997 school year|1996]]. She was among the majority of the wizarding population who believed [[Harry Potter]] to be the \"Chosen One\" destined to destroy [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], and became attracted to him.<ref name=\"HBP7\"/>\n\n[[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-romilda,_lavender,_and_Demelza.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Romilda at the Start-of-Term Feast sitting with fellow Gryffindors]]\n\nRomilda was part of a group of giggling fourth-year girls who went to Harry's compartment on the [[Hogwarts Express]]. They stood outside for a while, arguing about who should go in and invite Harry to sit with them. Romilda was the only one brave enough, remarking he didn't have to sit with the unpopular [[Luna Lovegood]] and [[Neville Longbottom]]. Harry, having fought alongside the pair during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] and considering Neville and Luna his friends, coldly denied her request, leaving Romilda very surprised when she departed with her friends. This made Luna and Neville think that they were uncool and maybe unworthy of sitting with the famous Harry Potter.<ref name=\"HBP7\"/>\n\nShe also tried out for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. When she and her group of friends were asked to fly once around the pitch, they simply fell over one another and giggled. Harry quickly asked them to leave; they left the pitch, but remained in the stadium to heckle the other applicants.<ref name=\"HBP11\">{{HBP|B|11}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Romilda.jpg|235px|thumb|Romilda working in the library]]\n\nDuring [[Christmas]] of that year, when Harry was invited to [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]'s lavish [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]], Romilda plotted with her friends in the girls' bathroom to somehow give Harry a [[love potion]] from [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]], which would make him ask one of them to be his guest to the party. [[Hermione Granger]] overheard this and warned Harry of her intentions. When he returned to the common room, Romilda initially tried to give Harry [[gillywater]], but he refused. Instead, she forced a package of [[Chocolate Cauldrons]], both of which were spiked with love potion, into his hands. She also made hints about wanting to go to the party with him, which Harry ignored.<ref name=\"HBP15\">{{HBP|B|15}}</ref>\n\nHarry proceeded to stow the love potion-spiked Chocolate Cauldrons away in his trunk until [[March]], when, while he was looking for the [[Marauder's Map]], he tossed them on the floor. [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], believing they were one of his birthday presents that had fallen off his bed, picked them up and ate them. Ron suddenly became obsessively infatuated with Romilda, to the point that he declared his love for her in front of Harry, then punched him when the former asked if it was a joke, and attempted to wrestle his way into Slughorn's office, believing she was in there. This led to [[Horace Slughorn]] giving Ron an [[Love Potion Antidote|antidote]]. Believing it was a \"''tonic for the nerves''\", Ron drank it and the potion's effects ceased. Soon afterwards, he was [[poison]]ed by drinking from a bottle of oak matured [[mead]] that was meant for [[Albus Dumbledore]].<ref name=\"HBP18\">{{HBP|B|18}}</ref>\n\nWhen Harry publicly kissed [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] after a [[Quidditch]] victory, Romilda looked as if she wanted to throw something.<ref name=\"HBP24\">{{HBP|B|24}}</ref> However, when the two subsequently began dating, Romilda gave up her efforts to win Harry's heart. She was nonetheless incessantly curious about their relationship and bombarded Ginny with questions, such as if Harry had a tattoo of a [[hippogriff]] on his chest.<ref name=\"HBP25\">{{HBP|B|25}}</ref>\n\n====Fifth year====\nIn her [[fifth year]] Romilda was present on the [[Hogwarts Express]] on the [[1 September]], [[1997]] when [[Death Eaters]] [[Raid on the Hogwarts Express|stormed]] the train in search of [[Harry Potter]].<ref name=\"DHF1\">{{DH|F1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Battle of Hogwarts DHF2.jpg|250x250px|thumb|left|Romilda during the Battle of Hogwarts, watching and possibly helping as other defenders of Hogwarts fight off [[Dementor]]s]]\nWhen Death Eaters gained control of Hogwarts she became a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation founded by the trio that fought the tyranny within the school. They were a radical and rebellious group of students dedicated to making things as difficult as possible for Death Eater professors [[Alecto Carrow|Alecto]] and [[Amycus Carrow]], as well as Headmaster [[Severus Snape]].\n\nIn [[1998]], when Harry Potter returned to the school, the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] broke out, which Romilda bravely fought in alongside her fellow D.A. members despite being underage. She ultimately survived the battle.<ref name=\"DHF2\">{{DH|F2}}</ref>\n\n===Later life {{Comment|[[2000]]-?}}===\nEventually, a [[music box]] topped with a [[ballet]] [[troll]] for which Romilda owned as an adult was displaced by the events of the [[Calamity]].

You don't have to sit with ''them''.|Romilda invites [[Harry Potter]] to ditch [[Neville Longbottom]] and [[Luna Lovegood]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\nLike [[James Potter I|James Potter]], Romilda seemed to represent all the stereotypical aspects of [[Gryffindor]] house, both positive and negative. She was domineering, conceited, and overly self-confident, though she is also genuinely perseverant, courageous, noble, and loyal to friends. Her honourable side was shown by her membership in [[Dumbledore's Army]], participation in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] showing she was genuinely heroic and brave.<ref name=\"DHF2\"/> She seemed to be the leader of her clique and was possibly the boldest among her friends, being the only one to offer a boy company or use a [[Love Potion]] on him,<ref name=\"HBP15\"/><ref name=\"HBP18\"/> and may have supplanted [[Cho Chang]] in her leadership.\n\nOn the other hand, she could also be sneaky and manipulative, as was evidenced by the lengths to which she was willing to go in her obsessive, single-minded pursuit of [[Harry Potter]].<ref name=\"HBP15\"/><ref name=\"HBP18\"/> However, she apparently stopped trying to win him over when he began dating [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]]. Her character was also marked by a tendency toward gossip and cliquish snobbery.<ref name=\"HBP25\" />\n\nHarry Potter once pointed out the similarities between himself and [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], and incidentally, the Love Potion that Romilda attempted to use on him was likely the same method that [[Merope Gaunt|Voldemort's mother]] likely used to trick [[Tom Riddle Senior|his father]] into marrying her. Furthermore, Romilda's obsession with Harry was vaguely similar to the obsessive \"[[love]]\" that Voldemort's mother had had for his father. But, Romilda differed from Merope Gaunt in that she easily gave up her pursuit of Harry after he became involved with Ginny while Merope resorted to conceiving a child with Tom Riddle Snr while he was under the mind-altering effects of a love potion. In spite of her bad qualities, she was reasonable to a fault and capable of behaving sensibly and pragmatically when she chose to.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': Romilda was evidently a very skilled and talented duellist who was highly accomplished in [[martial magic]], as she was a prominent member of the Gryffindor [[Duelling Club]] and she also fought courageously in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against the [[Death Eaters]] and survived, as her name was not mentioned among the [[Fallen Fifty]].<ref name=\"DHF2\"/>\n\n==Possessions==\n[[File:MusicBoxWU.png|120px|thumb|Romilda's music box]]\n*'''[[Wand]]''': Romilda owned a wand, which was of an unknown length, [[wand wood]] and [[Wand core|core]]. She presumably purchased it from [[Ollivanders]], in [[Diagon Alley]], London, before starting her [[first year]] at Hogwarts.\n*'''[[Music box]]''': Romilda apparently owned a music box topped with a [[ballet]] [[troll]], which was returned to her by the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] after it was displaced by the [[Calamity]].<ref name=\"WU\">{{WU}} ([https://youtu.be/eMg4E84XeCE?t=628 see video])</ref>\n\n==Relationships==\n===Harry Potter===\n{{Quote|Well, just be careful what you drink, because Romilda Vane looked like she meant business.|[[Hermione Granger]] regarding Romilda's desire to ensnare Harry with [[Love potion]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\n[[File:HBP promo side Harry cropped.jpg|thumb|Harry Potter, her crush]]\nRomilda was obsessively in [[love]] with [[Harry Potter]], mostly because she thought he was the Chosen One.<ref name=\"HBP7\"/> However, she let him go after he started dating [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], narrowly restraining herself from reacting violently when she saw him kissing Ginny Weasley.<ref name=\"HBP24\"/> Harry was far less charitable in his regard for her. He considered her to be obnoxious and had little patience for her. He coldly rebuffed her invitation to sit with her and her friends.<ref name=\"HBP7\"/> Ironically, it is possible that Romilda laughed at him when he would have asked Cho out, before learning he was the Chosen One. This said, he might have remembered her while Romilda might have forgotten all about that. However, she later showed her immense loyalty and respect towards Harry and his cause by joining [[Dumbledore's Army]] and by fighting bravely in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].<ref name=\"DHF2\"/>\n\n===Leanne and Katie Bell===\nRomilda got along well with [[Leanne]] as well as the latter's best friend [[Katie Bell]]. Romilda sat with Leanne on the [[Hogwarts Express]] during her fifth year,<ref name=\"DHF1\"/> and much later they kept each other company and rested either during or after the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].<ref name=\"DHF2\"/>\n\n===Other Hogwarts students===\nRomilda's regard for [[Luna Lovegood]] and [[Neville Longbottom]] was clearly negative, as she was envious of Harry's close and platonic relationship with them, clearly considering herself a superior witch.<ref name=\"HBP7\"/> She was also jealous when Harry invited Luna to the [[Slug Club]].<ref name=\"HBP15\"/>\n\nRomilda was even more jealous of [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], as Harry chose her over the former, as she learned upon watching them make out, nearly goading her into throwing something.<ref name=\"HBP24\"/> However, she was still a loyal and committed member of [[Dumbledore's Army]] and was fiercely determined to fighting alongside other [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] student to protect their school from [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his army.<ref name=\"DHF2\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nRomilda is derived from the Germanic ''hrom'', \"fame\" and ''hild'', \"battle.\"<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/romilda Behind the Name: Romilda]</ref> This may allude to Romilda's aggressive personality. The surname ''Vane'' is likely a play on the adjective ''vain'', meaning \"excessively proud of or concerned about one's own appearance, qualities, achievements,\"<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/vain Dictionary Definition: Vain]</ref> given Romilda's character traits.\n\nHer surname may also be a reference to Sibyl Vane, the alluring actress in Oscar Wilde's novel ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Grey The Picture of Dorian Gray]''. In the novel, Sibyl is infatuated with Dorian, much in the same way that Romilda is infatuated with Harry, only to be rejected by Dorian when he no longer finds her pleasing.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Deathly_Hallows_Part_2._Romilda_Vane.jpg|210px|thumb|Romilda Vane in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Deathly Hallows: Part 2]]'']]\n*Romilda Vane was played by actress [[Anna Shaffer]] in {{HBP|FA}} and the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|film adaptation]] of {{DH|F2}}. Also in the film adaptations, Romilda is a [[sixth year]] instead of a [[fourth year]].\n*In the first part [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|film adaptation]] of {{DH}}, Romilda can be briefly seen on the [[Hogwarts Express]] sitting next to [[Leanne]], [[Lavender Brown]], and [[Cormac McLaggen]].\n*In {{DH|F2}} Romilda participates in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. However, in the novel's canon, she would have only been a [[fifth year]] at the time (though in movie canon she would have been a seventh year), and if she had been at Hogwarts she would have been sent away before the battle with the other underage students, although she could have come back like [[Colin Creevey]].\n*It is unclear how she learned to cast a [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], but she probably learned it from the D.A. It's unusual for fifth-years to be capable of such a feat. It's also unclear if she shot a Patronus at Harry's assailants or simply watched, as she lowered her wand rather quickly.\n*In the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|''Half-Blood Prince'' film]], it appears that Harry is flattered by Romilda's [[Love|interest]] in him, until [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] reminds him that Romilda is only interested in him because she, like most of the wizarding world, believes him to be the ''\"Chosen One\"'', to which he replies ''\"but I am the Chosen One\"''. Then Hermione gets irritated by it and swats him with a copy of the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''. This contrasts the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|book]], in which Harry dislikes, and is disconcerted by, Romilda's attention from the start.\n*In the film adaptation of ''Deathly Hallows'' she survived the battle. After the camera is on [[Dean Thomas|Dean]], [[Seamus Finnigan|Seamus]] and [[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]], on the right one can see [[Katie Bell|Katie]], [[Leanne]] and Romilda talking, and possibly [[Cho Chang|Cho]] as well. She and Leanne also sat together on the Hogwarts Express.\n**This said, it is very likely Romilda was one of the members of Cho's posse. While this statement is contradicted by Romilda being the leader, it is not mentioned until {{HBP}}, a year after Cho's friends left her minus [[Marietta Edgecombe]]. After Cho went into a depression following [[Cedric Diggory]]'s death, it would add up if she became the leader in her place despite being younger than Cho.\n**This would mean the two girls who argued over inviting Harry to sit with them were the same people who laughed at him when he tried to ask Cho out, which may explain why they both hesitated prompting Romilda herself to step forward.\n*Nothing much is known about her personality in the films partly due to the fact that she has no lines in any of the films she appears in. She appears to be much less obnoxious than in the book.\n*In {{LEGO|Y2}}, Romilda is omitted from the console versions of the game. Due to this, Ron, after consuming the [[Love Potion]], is made to fall in love not with her, but anyone or anything he first sees.\n*The actress who plays Romilda, [[Anna Shaffer]], also plays another witch character in Netflix's series, ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_(TV_series) The Witcher]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Romilda Vane}}\n*{{GOF}} {{Possible}}\n*{{GOF|F}} {{Possible}}\n*{{HBP}} {{1st}}\n*{{HBP|F}}\n*{{HBP|G}}\n*{{DH|F1}}\n*{{DH|F2}}\n*{{PM}}\n*{{WW}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}} {{C|DS Version}}\n*{{WU}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Duelling Club}}\n{{Dumbledore's Army}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vane, Romilda}}\n[[de:Romilda Vane]]\n[[fr:Romilda Vane]]\n[[it:Romilda Vane]]\n[[pl:Romilda Vane]]\n[[ru:\u0420\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0430 \u0412\u0435\u0439\u043d]]\n[[ja:\u30ed\u30df\u30eb\u30c0\u30fb\u30d9\u30a4\u30f3]]\n[[Category:1980s births]]\n[[Category:Battle of Hogwarts participants]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Duelling Club members]]\n[[Category:Dumbledore's Army]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1993]]\n[[Category:Vane family]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
