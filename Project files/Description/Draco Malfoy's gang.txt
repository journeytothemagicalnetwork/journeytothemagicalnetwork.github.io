He and his family out of favour with Lord Voldemort, he was put to ill use by the Dark Lord, forced to torture others who had earned Voldemort's disfavour via the [[Cruciatus Curse]].

Draco also ceased his relationship with [[Pansy Parkinson]], who was his girlfriend during their years at school, and instead he married Astoria.\n\n==Attitude toward Harry Potter==\n[[Harry Potter]] was in the same year as most of Draco Malfoy's gang.
