[[1943]]\u2014[[1993]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who ran [[Dominic Maestro's Music Shop]], in [[Hogsmeade]] in the [[1990s]].<ref name=\"LEGOY1\">{{LEGO|Y1}}</ref>\n\nHe attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in his youth and received an award in [[1943]].<ref name=\"WWHP\">See [http://www.flickr.com/photos/charminggoats/4707332209/ this image]</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Dominic\" is from the Late Latin name Dominicus meaning \"of the Lord\". This name was traditionally given to a child born on Sunday. Several saints have borne this name, including the 13th-century founder of the Dominican order of friars. It was in this saint's honour that the name was first used in England, starting around the 13th century. It is primarily used by Catholics.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, the character uses the same model as [[Albus Dumbledore]].\n*Also in {{LEGO|Y1}}, [[Draco Malfoy]] assaults this man in [[1993]], using a large snowman that produced snowballs.\n*The name of this character is presumably a tribute to Dominic Masters, who worked as an assistant art director on the first three [[Harry Potter films|''Harry Potter'' films]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0557666/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr120 Dominic Master's profile on IMDb]</ref> This makes sense, as \"Maestro\" is Italian for \"master\".\n\n==Appearances==\n[[File:Domincis.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Dominic Maestro's shop in Hogsmeade]]\n*{{LEGO|Y1}} {{1st}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}} {{Mention}}\n*{{WWHP}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maestro, Dominic}}\n\n\n{{Hogsmeade}}\n[[es:Dominic Maestro]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043a \u041c\u0430\u044d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e]]\n[[pl:Dominic Maestro]]\n[[Category:British individuals]]\n[[Category:Maestro family]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Shop owners]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
