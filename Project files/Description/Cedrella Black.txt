As revealed in ''[[Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies]]'', Chapter 3 (Horace Slughorn), Slughorn had \"completed half a century of service\" at the time of his retirement in [[1981]], meaning he started teaching there circa [[1931]]. Cedrella, born between [[1915]] and early [[1919]], presumably attended Hogwarts starting between 1926 and 1930 and graduating between 1933 and 1938, and thus would have been a student of Slughorn for at least part of her time at Hogwarts.</ref>\n|loyalty = *[[House of Black]] (disowned)\n*[[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]\n**[[Slytherin]]\n*[[Weasley family]]\n}}\n'''Cedrella Weasley''' (n\u00e9e '''Black''') was a [[pure-blood]] witch, the second eldest daughter of [[Arcturus Black II]] and [[Lysandra Yaxley|Lysandra Black]], and sister of [[Charis Black|Charis]] and [[Callidora Black|Callidora]].\n\nCedrella married [[Septimus Weasley]]. The [[Weasley family]] had been considered [[blood traitor]]s ever since they protested their inclusion in the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]], and so, due to her marriage, Cedrella was disowned and burned off the [[Black Family Tapestry|Black family tree tapestry]].<ref name=\"BFT\"/>\n\nCedrella and Septimus had three sons, one of whom is [[Arthur Weasley]]. Through Cedrella, the [[Weasley family]] is related not only to the Black family, but also to the [[Crouch family|Crouch]] and [[Longbottom family|Longbottom]] families.<ref name=\"BFT\" /> Through [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]], she has seven grandchildren.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Cedrella'' is a rare feminine variant of \"Cedric\", which in turn is derived from the Old Celtic name ''Caratacos'', which means \"[[love]]\".<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/submit/name/cedrella BehindTheName.com]</ref>\n\n''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedrela Cedrela] ''is also a genus in the mahogany family, native to the New World. ''Cedrela odorata'' is a timber wood often sold under the name \"Spanish-cedar\" even though it is neither Spanish nor a cedar. It is used in the making of cigar boxes and guitars as well as general construction work.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*[[Horace Slughorn]] claimed that the Blacks were almost exclusively sorted into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]],<ref>{{HBP}}</ref> thus Cedrella might be considered an example of a \"good Slytherin\" for her non-biased views about [[Blood status|blood purity]]. Given that she was born between [[1915]] and [[1919]], she would have most likely been one of the first students of Slughorn's at some point, as Slughorn began his teaching career in [[1931]].\n*Cedrella\u2019s older sister Callidora was born in 1915, and her younger sister Charis was born in 1919, so Cedrella must have been born sometime between late 1915 and early 1919.\n*Cedrella had three sons. One of them was [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]], and it is possible that another one was [[Bilius]].\n*On the family tree, Cedrella is depicted next to her sisters. She looks similar to her great-aunt [[Iola Black|Iola]], who was likewise disowned due to her marriage.\n*Cedrella is similar to [[Andromeda Tonks]], who, like Cedrella, was the middle of three daughters and married against her family's wishes while her elder and younger sisters made \"respectable\" [[Pure-blood|pureblood]] [[marriage]]s.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{OOTP|F}} {{Comment|Appears on Black family tapestry}}\n*{{OOTP|G}} {{Comment|Seen on [[House of Black|Black family]] tree tapestry}}\n*{{DH|G1}} {{Comment|Seen on [[House of Black|Black family]] tree tapestry}}\n*{{HM}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Black, Cedrella}}\n\n[[de:Cedrella Black]]\n[[es:Cedrella Black]] \n[[fi:Cedrella Musta]]\n[[fr:Cedrella Black]]\n[[pl:Cedrella Weasley]]\n[[ru:\u0426\u0435\u0434\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0430 \u0411\u043b\u044d\u043a]]\n[[Category:1910s births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Disowned members of the House of Black|Cedrella]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Married individuals]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Pure-bloods]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Weasley family|Cedrella]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
