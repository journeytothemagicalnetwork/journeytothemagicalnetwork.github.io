They were caught, presumably kissing, in the [[rose]] bushes during the Ball by [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], and were each docked ten [[House points]].<ref name=\"GOF23\">{{GOF|B|23}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*In a deleted scene from {{GOF|FA}}, Stebbins and [[Fawcett]] are caught kissing in one of the [[Hogwarts Carriages]], which were parked in the [[Viaduct Courtyard|Entrance Courtyard]].<ref>{{GOF|F}}</ref>\n*In the [[Great Britain|British]], [[Canada|Canadian]], [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], Russian, Polish and Danish editions of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', when Snape catches Fawcett with Stebbins in chapter 23, he says, \"Ten points from [[Hufflepuff]], Fawcett! And ten points from [[Ravenclaw]], too, Stebbins!\", although Fawcett is referred to as a Ravenclaw by [[Albus Dumbledore]] in chapter 16.<ref name=\"lexicon\">\"[http://www.hplex.info/wizards/a-z/f.html#Fawcett S. Fawcett]\" on The Harry Potter Lexicon</ref> The American edition of the novel amends this error, with Snape taking Fawcett's points from Ravenclaw, and Stebbins' from Hufflepuff.<ref name=\"lexicon\" /> In the ''Goblet of Fire'' film, however, Snape makes a similar error where he refers to Fawcett as a Hufflepuff and Stebbins as a Ravenclaw. The only way it couldn't be a mistake is that Snape mentions the consequences of the partner's rule-breakings.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{GOF}} {{1st}}\n*{{GOF|F}} {{Comment|Deleted scene}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[fr:Stebbins (\u00e9poque de Harry Potter)]]\n[[de:Stebbins jr.]]\n[[nl:Stalpeert Jr.]]\n[[pl:Stebbins]]\n[[zh:\u65af\u7279\u5bbe\u65af (1980\u5e74\u4ee3)]]\n[[ru:\u0421\u0442\u0435\u0431\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0441]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Hufflepuffs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
