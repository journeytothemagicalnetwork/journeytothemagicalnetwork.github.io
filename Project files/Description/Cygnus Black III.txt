As revealed in ''[[Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies]]'', Chapter 3 (Horace Slughorn), Slughorn had \"completed half a century of service\" at the time of his retirement in [[1981]], meaning he started teaching there circa [[1931]]. Cygnus, born in [[1938]], presumably attended Hogwarts from [[1949]] to [[1956]], and thus would have been a student of Slughorn. [[Sirius Black]] also states \"My whole family have been in [[Slytherin]]\" and in Chapter 23 of {{DH}}, confirming that at least those Blacks closely related to Sirius were in [[Slytherin]].</ref>\n|loyalty = [[House of Black]]<ref name=\"BFT\" />\n*[[Crabbe family]]\n*[[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]\n**[[Slytherin]]\n*[[Rosier family]]<ref name=\"BFT\" />\n}}\n'''Cygnus Black''' ([[1938]] \u2013 [[1992]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and member of the noble [[House of Black]]. He was a student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin]].\n\n==Biography==\nCygnus was born in [[1938]], the youngest son of [[Pollux Black]] and [[Irma Crabbe]] and brother of [[Walburga Black|Walburga]] and [[Alphard Black|Alphard]], who was later blasted off the family tapestry.\n\nHe married [[Druella Black|Druella Rosier]], and the couple had three daughters: [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], the eldest, in [[1951]], [[Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]], the middle child, between 1951-[[1955]], and [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Black]], the youngest child, in 1955.<ref>''[[House of Black|Black Family tree]]''</ref>\n[[File:Narcissa, Andromeda, and Bellatrix.jpeg|200px|thumb|left|Cygnus's three daughters from left to right, [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]], [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], and [[Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]]]]\nAndromeda was disowned for marrying a [[Muggle-born]] wizard, [[Edward Tonks|Ted Tonks]]. All the family but Sirius (and also possibly her uncle [[Alphard Black|Alphard]]) subsequently shunned her.<ref>Bellatrix says in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]]'': \"We \u2013 Narcissa and I \u2013 have never set eyes on our sister since she married the [[Mudblood]].\" This suggests that the family as a whole refused to see Andromeda after her marriage and disownment.</ref> Through his eldest daughter, he is the grandfather of [[Delphini]], who was fathered by Voldemort as a result of their affair at [[Malfoy Manor]]. Through his disowned daughter and his youngest daughter, Cygnus is the grandfather of [[Nymphadora Tonks]] and [[Draco Malfoy]] respectively, and is also the great-grandfather of [[Edward Lupin|Teddy Lupin]] and [[Scorpius Malfoy]], respectively.\n\nHe died in 1992, when [[Draco Malfoy|his grandson]] was attending his first or second year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Cygnus was the second last remaining Black of the male line before [[Sirius Black|his nephew]].\n\n==Etymology==\nLike many other members of the [[House of Black]], Cygnus is named after a [[Wikipedia:Cygnus (constellation)|constellation]]. Cygnus is a northern constellation known as the Swan or the Northern Cross. It was named for several swans which appear in Greek mythology, including the one Zeus transformed into to seduce Leda, the form Orpheus took after his death, and a [[Wikipedia:Cycnus|son]] of the god Apollo who was turned into a swan after his murder. The name is derived from the Greek \u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, ''kyknos'', meaning \"swan\".\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Cygnus and his wife were likely in [[Slytherin]] house like the rest of the family.\n*Cygnus was named after his [[Cygnus Black II|paternal grandfather]]. There was also [[Cygnus Black I|Cygnus I]], an early member of the [[House of Black]], who was most likely [[Phineas Nigellus Black]]'s father and thus Cygnus's great-great-grandfather.\n*If Cygnus was truly born in 1938, than he would've been considerably young when his eldest daughter Bellatrix was born in 1951; this means that, like his father, Cygnus had a child at 13. It's possible that both are errors, as [[J. K. Rowling]] stated that math isn't her strong suit, and the [[House of Black#Black family tree|Black Family Tapestry]] has other similar errors.\n**An [[:File:JKRBlackFamilyTree.jpg|earlier draft]] of the tapestry gives him more plausible years of 1929-1979. It's unknown why these years were changed however.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{OOTP|F}} {{Comment|Appears on Black family tapestry}}\n*{{OOTP|G}} {{Comment|Seen on [[House of Black|Black family]] tree tapestry}}\n*{{DH|G1}} {{Comment|Seen on [[House of Black|Black family]] tree tapestry}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}[[es:Cygnus Black III]]\n[[fi:Cygnus Musta III]]\n[[fr:Cygnus Black III]]\n[[nl:Cygnus Zwarts III]]\n[[ru:\u0421\u0438\u0433\u043d\u0443\u0441 \u0411\u043b\u044d\u043a III]]\n[[pl:Cygnus Black III]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Black, Cygnus III}}\n[[Category:1938 births]]\n[[Category:1992 deaths]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:House of Black]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Married individuals]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Pure-bloods]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 20th century]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
