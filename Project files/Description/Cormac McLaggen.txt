He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1990]] to [[1997]]. He was Sorted into [[Gryffindor]] house and was one year above the famous [[Harry Potter]].\n\nMcLaggen lost the opportunity to try out for his house's [[Quidditch]] [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|team]] in his sixth year after he ate [[poison]]ous [[Doxy egg]]s on a bet, but became the reserve [[Keeper]] in his [[1996|seventh year]]. During the course of his last year at Hogwarts, he also became a member of the [[Slug Club]], escorted [[Hermione Granger]] to the club's [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]], and was primarily responsible for the Gryffindor Quidditch team's embarrassing loss to [[Hufflepuff]] by hitting Harry Potter (seeker at the time) over the head with a beater's bat.\n\nLike most [[Gryffindor]] [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|students]], McLaggen participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts|final battle]] of the [[Second Wizarding War]] and fought alongside the defenders of Hogwarts. McLaggen survived the battle; it is currently unknown what happened to McLaggen after the war.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Dialogue a-b|Horace Slughorn|Now, you, Cormac, I happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?|McLaggen|Oh, yeah, that was fun, that was. We went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour; this was before he became Minister, obviously \u2014|[[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] interviewing McLaggen|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\n\nLittle is known of McLaggen's early life, though it appears that he was born into a relatively influential wizarding family, as his uncle [[Tiberius]] was an important official in the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and was friendly with the head of the [[Auror]] Office and later [[Minister for Magic]] [[Rufus Scrimgeour]]. Tiberius took his nephew hunting [[Nogtail]]s on at least one occasion, with Scrimgeour and [[Bertie Higgs]] in [[Norfolk]].<ref name=\"HBP7\">{{HBP|B|7}}</ref>\n\n===Hogwarts years {{C|1990\u20131997}}===\n\n====Early years====\nCormac McLaggen started his education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1990]] and was Sorted into [[Gryffindor]], along with [[Katie Bell]] who also was a Sorted Gryffindor that year. Cormac was a skilled flyer on a broom and [[Quidditch]] player, specifically playing the position of [[Keeper]].\n\n====Sixth year====\n{{Quote|I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials. Ate a pound of doxy eggs for a bet.|McLaggen explaining his bet with swagger|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\n\n[[File:Harrypottercelebutopia23.jpg|250px|thumb|left|McLaggen at the [[Keeper]] try-outs standing next to Ron Weasley]]\n\nIn [[1995\u20131996 school year]], McLaggen's [[sixth year]] at Hogwarts, he ate a pound of [[poison]]ous [[Doxy egg]]s on a bet to prove his bravery. This foolhardy decision kept him from joining the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], something he cared a great deal about. With [[Oliver Wood]]'s graduation at the end of the [[1993\u20131994 school year]] and the [[Triwizard Tournament]] cancelling all [[Quidditch]] matches the following year, the Gryffindor team was in need of a [[Keeper]] at the beginning of the [[1995\u20131996 school year]]. Unfortunately for McLaggen, he was in the [[Hospital Wing]] being treated for doxy egg poisoning at the time of the trials, and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] was made [[Keeper]] instead.<ref name=\"HBP11\">{{HBP|B|11}}</ref>\n\n====Seventh year====\n{{Quote|Oh, it was quite fun, really. I mean, he drones on about famous exploits a bit, and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because he's so well connected, but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog Jones.|A typical Slug Club meeting|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\n\nThe following year, McLaggen's last, he met Professor [[Horace Slughorn]] on the [[Hogwarts Express]]. Because of his well-connected uncle [[Tiberius]], McLaggen was invited to be a member of the Slug Club.<ref name=\"HBP7\" />\n\n[[File:Movies-HBPGermanCalendar-slugclub2-004.jpg|250px|thumb|McLaggen attending a [[Slug Club]] dinner party]]\n\nSoon after his seventh year began, McLaggen tried out for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], but he managed to make only four out of five saves. This was because Hermione Granger, who overheard McLaggen making rude remarks about [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], had dishonestly placed a [[Confundus Charm]] on him. McLaggen angrily asked team captain [[Harry Potter]] for another try, but Harry refused, and Ron was given the position of [[Keeper]] again, as he beat McLaggen in saves.<ref name=\"HBP11\" />\n\nIn December, McLaggen attended Professor Slughorn's [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]] with Hermione, who was also a member of the Slug Club.<ref name=\"HBP15\">{{HBP|B|15}}</ref> The evening did not go well for him, however, as Hermione only asked him out to get back at Ron dating [[Lavender Brown]] to spite her. McLaggen ended up driving her crazy by talking about himself excessively, boasting about his Quidditch abilities, and being too forward romantically. She avoided him for most of the night to talk to Harry and [[Luna Lovegood]]. McLaggen asked Harry if he had seen her later just after Hermione departed the party, to which Harry denied.<ref name=\"HBP15\"/>\n\n[[File:Cormac McLaggen HBP 5.jpg|250px|thumb|left|McLaggen playing Keeper for Gryffindor after Ron Weasley is poisoned by Draco Malfoy]]\n\nWhen Ron was hospitalised in [[March]], before Gryffindor's second game against [[Hufflepuff]], Harry Potter was forced to play McLaggen as his reserve Keeper. In the week leading up to the match, Harry had his doubts about his new team-mate. Although he was skilled, McLaggen was also bossy and repeatedly tried to advise Harry on game strategy and insulted the other players' abilities. The match was a no-holds-barred disaster, as McLaggen spent much more time trying to tell the rest of the team how to play rather than watching the rings, resulting in several goals for the opponent. This culminated in him wrestling a [[Beater's bat]] away from [[Jimmy Peakes]] and attempting to show him how to hit a [[Bludger]], only to knock Harry off his broomstick and crack his skull.<ref name=\"HBP19\"/>\n\nThe fiasco was possibly Gryffindor's worst and most embarrassing loss ever (a final score of 320-60), and Ron told Harry in the [[Hospital Wing]] that he thought McLaggen's enraged teammates ''\"might've dealt with him before you get out of here...\"''<ref name=\"HBP19\">{{HBP|B|19}}</ref> When Ron recovered, he resumed the [[Keeper]] position while Cormac was permanently removed from the team.\n\n====Repeat year====\n{{Quote|My father will hear about this!|Cormac trying to scare the [[Death Eaters]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1}}\n\n[[File:DH1 Death Eaters inside Hogwarts Express 01.jpg|250px|thumb|Cormac and other students are meet by Death Eaters]]\n\nCormac was forced to repeat his final year. When the [[Death Eaters]] [[Raid on the Hogwarts Express|boarded the train]], he foolishly stated that [[Cormac McLaggen's father|his father]] would hear about this, but the Death Eaters completely ignored him.<ref name=\"DHF1\">{{DH|F1}}</ref> \n\nCormac joined the revived [[Dumbledore's Army]] to oppose the Death Eater teachers [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow]]. He later fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] and survived the battle.<ref name=\"DHF2\">{{DH|F2}}</ref>\n\n==Physical appearance==\nMcLaggen was described as a large, wire-haired youth.<ref name=\"HBP7\" /> His face went red whenever he became angry. At the [[Keeper]] tryouts in [[1996]], [[Harry Potter]] thought that McLaggen was large enough that he could block all three goal hoops without even moving.<ref name=\"HBP11\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You should have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny! He's got a nasty temper. You wouldn't want someone like that on the team.|McLaggen's foul and rude behaviour|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\n\n[[File:Ron cormac.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Cormac attempting to intimidate Ron Weasley]]\n\nAggressive, arrogant, and self-righteous, McLaggen epitomised the most negative aspects of the stereotypical [[Gryffindor]] characteristics. Though brave, he was foolhardy rather than self-sacrificing. He was also arrogant and pushy and felt a strong sense of entitlement.<ref name=\"HBP19\" /> According to [[Hermione Granger]], McLaggen was rude, insensitive, and over-assertive when making romantic advances. All he did was talk about himself and lacked manners and consideration of others. It was due to this that Hermione remarked that [[Grawp]] (Hagrid's [[giant]] half-brother) was more mannered than Cormac.<ref name=\"HBP15\">{{HBP|B|15}}</ref> \n\n{{Quote|Tricky conditions! [[Ritchie Coote|Coote]], [[Jimmy Peakes|Peakes]], you\u2019ll want to fly out of the sun, so they don\u2019t see you coming \u2014|McLaggen arrogantly attempting to give Quidditch advice to other players|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\nMcLaggen also had a bad temper; for example, [[Harry Potter]] thought he might [[Muggle duelling|punch]] him for refusing his demand to give him another [[Quidditch]] tryout.<ref name=\"HBP11\" /> He also blamed others, doing so with [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] for not properly shooting at her brother Ron during [[Keeper]] tryouts.<ref name=\"HBP11\"/> When Harry was forced to put McLaggen on the team as a substitute Keeper, McLaggen proved to be a poor team player and a poor Keeper overall. He spent much more time in the match offering unwanted observations of others rather than concentrating on what he was meant to be doing in the game.<ref name=\"HBP7\"/>\n\nRegardless of his negative traits, Cormac proved himself quite brave and righteous, willingly joining his allies in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] despite having no obligation to do so, and actually acting as one of the leaders of [[Dumbledore's Army]] during [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort's]] reign over [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], alongside [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], and [[Luna Lovegood]].<ref name=\"DHF2\"/>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n{{Quote|To [[Harry Potter|Harry]]\u2019s great disappointment, Cormac McLaggen saved four penalties out of five.|Cormac's impressive Quidditch skills|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\n[[File:Cormac saves goals.gif|250px|thumb|McLaggen playing as Keeper during a Quidditch match]]\n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Cormac was a very accomplished and talented [[broomstick]] flyer, and he joined the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] as a reserve [[Keeper]] in his seventh year, showing his impressive [[Quidditch]] skills.<ref name=\"HBP19\"/>\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': Cormac was a very skilled duellist, as he bravely fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against the [[Death Eaters]], and survived. He would have had to have been very proficient with [[Martial magic]] to have survived such a bloody and violent conflict.<ref name=\"DHF2\"/>\n\n==Relationships==\n===Hermione Granger===\n{{Quote|I've just escaped \u2014 I mean, I've just left Cormac.

Oh no, here he comes!|Hermione Granger to Harry Potter on attending the Christmas Party with McLaggen|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\n\n[[File:Hermione Granger HBP.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hermione Granger]], whom he was infatuated with]]\n\nIn his seventh year, McLaggen became familiar with [[Hermione Granger]] when they were both members of the [[Slug Club]]. Hermione seemed to think that McLaggen was arrogant and unpleasant, and when she overheard him insult [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] during [[Quidditch]] try-outs, she hit him with a [[Confundus Charm]], unbeknownst to him.<ref name=\"HBP7\" />\n\nHowever, when Hermione and Ron later had a row over Ron\u2019s romance with [[Lavender Brown]], she tried to make him jealous by asking McLaggen to attend [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]\u2019s [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]] with her, choosing the person she thought would annoy Ron the most. He accepted, but spent most of the evening boasting about himself, to her irritation. He was very forward with her under the mistletoe, prompting Hermione to abandon him to seek out [[Harry Potter]] and [[Luna Lovegood]] and to avoid him for the rest of the party. He was very annoyed when he was unable to find her.<ref name=\"HBP15\" /> This indicates that while McLaggen was romantically interested in Hermione, she found him to be a rude braggart.\n\n===Harry Potter===\n{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|McLaggen|His sister didn\u2019t really try. She gave him an easy save.|Harry Potter|Rubbish. That was the one he nearly missed.|Give me another go.|No. You\u2019ve had your go. You saved four. Ron saved five. Ron\u2019s Keeper, he won it fair and square. Get out of my way.|McLaggen and [[Harry Potter]] arguing during [[Quidditch]] tryouts|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\n\n[[File:HBP_promo_side_Harry_cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Harry Potter]], who disliked him]]\n\nAlthough they were in the same House, Harry strongly disliked McLaggen. The two first met in [[1996]] when they were both questioned by [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]].<ref name=\"HBP7\" /> They met again when McLaggen tried out for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], of which Harry was the [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]]. It seemed that McLaggen wrongly expected preferential treatment from Harry because the two were both in the [[Slug Club]].\n\nWhen [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] beat McLaggen in saves, he accused [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] of purposely giving her brother an advantage. He angrily confronted Harry about it, who coldly refuted the accusations. Harry thought that McLaggen might punch him for a moment.<ref name=\"HBP11\" /> Later in the year, when McLaggen temporarily replaced Ron, he annoyed Harry immensely by repeatedly offering advice on game strategy, and spent so much time ordering around his team-mates and knocking Harry out instead of blocking goals that [[Gryffindor]] ultimately lost the match.<ref name=\"HBP19\" />\n\nCormac also disliked Harry because he was best friends with [[Hermione Granger]] (whom Cormac fancied). Cormac and Harry also seemed to both represent different aspects of Gryffindor: with Cormac personifying the negative traits such as arrogance and self-righteousness, while Harry embodied the positive traits of chivalry, courage, and having a self-sacrificing nature. However, they both seemed to have nasty tempers.\n\n===Ron Weasley===\n[[File:Ron Weasley Half Blood Prince.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], his rival]]\n{{Dialogue a-b|Ron Weasley|Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen?|Harry Potter|I dunno. They were at Slughorn\u2019s party together, but I don\u2019t think it went that well.|Ron's jealousy towards McLaggen|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\nMcLaggen and Ron Weasley took an instant dislike to one another in [[1996]], when they competed over the [[Keeper]] position on the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. McLaggen believed that the team Captain, [[Harry Potter]], showed favouritism toward his friend, whereas Harry thought Ron was simply the better player and that McLaggen was far too arrogant to make a decent player.<ref name=\"HBP11\" />\n\nRon\u2019s dislike of McLaggen prompted [[Hermione Granger]] to ask him to escort her to [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn\u2019s]] [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]], which he did, much to Ron\u2019s displeasure.<ref name=\"HBP16\">{{HBP|B|16}}</ref> He was further annoyed when McLaggen took over his position as Keeper after he was poisoned, and relieved when it did not go well.<ref name=\"HBP19\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Cormac'' is borne by a number of figures from Irish legend and history, including [[Wikipedia:Cormac mac Airt|Cormac mac Airt]], a warrior king of [[Ireland]], and [[Wikipedia:Cormac Cond Longas|Cormac Cond Longas]], an exiled prince of Ulster. The name is most commonly translated as \"charioteer\", but can be also translated into \"raven\"- a bird strongly associated with warfare in Celtic mythology. This may allude to McLaggen's aggressive personality. The name can also be translated to mean \"son of defilement\", from the Gaelic ''corb'', \"defilement\", and ''mac'', \"son\".<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/cormac Behind the Name: Cormac]</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Cormac McLaggen LEGO Y2.png|150px|thumb|Cormac McLaggen as he appears in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]\n[[File:Cormac McLaggen WU.png|150px|thumb|Cormac McLaggen as seen in {{WU}}]]\n*Cormac McLaggen was played by [[Freddie Stroma]] in {{HBP|FA}} and the two-part [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (film)|film adaptation]] of {{DH}}.\n*In {{DH|F1}}, Cormac is seen on the [[Hogwarts Express]] returning to school for the [[1997\u20131998 school year]]<ref>[http://mugglenet.com/app/news/full_story/3335 Freddie Stroma to return for Deathly Hallows]</ref> and he also appeared in the [[Room of Requirement]] in {{DH|F2}}, however, in the novel of {{HBP}}, Cormac was in his seventh and final year (it wasn't mentioned in the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|film]], though). However, because he was constantly thinking up new [[Quidditch]] strategies in his final year, it's quite possible that he was doing bad in his studies and had to stay back a year. Another possibility is that he was returning to Hogwarts to take his [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.S]], as all examinations were cancelled in the previous year following the death of [[Albus Dumbledore]].\n*In the films, Cormac takes part in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] and appears as a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]].\n*In {{HBP|FA}}, Cormac is given a month of [[Discipline at Hogwarts|detention]] for throwing up on [[Severus Snape|Snape's]] shoes (an event that never occurred in the book) because Harry tricked him into believing that the [[dragon tartare]] he was eating was dragon testicles, or ''\"dragon balls\"'' as Harry called them.\n*There was a scene with Ron confronting Cormac before the Quidditch match in the film, but it was later removed. This scene was never released.\n*It is unknown if he is in the same year as Harry in the films; it is possible albeit rather unlikely.\n*In the film he never knocks Harry out since the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff was completely omitted.\n*In the films, Cormac seems to be less obnoxious than in the books.\n*Due to his joining the DA, and seemingly being a fairly reasonable character, if a bit cocky, in the films, it is rather unclear to people who haven't read the books why Hermione is quite contemptuous of him and his feelings for her.\n*In {{DH|F2}}, Cormac appears in several scenes but has no speaking lines.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Cormac McLaggen}}\n*{{HBP}} {{1st}}\n*{{HBP|F}}\n*{{HBP|G}}\n*{{DH|F1}}\n*{{DH|F2}}\n*{{PM}}\n*{{WW}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}}\n*{{HPV|CH}}\n*{{WU}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=[[Ronald Weasley]]\n|position=[[Keeper]] of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]\n|years=[[1996]]\n|successor=[[Ronald Weasley]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n{{Dumbledore's Army}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McLaggen, Cormac}}\n[[de:Cormac McLaggen]]\n[[de2:Cormac McLaggen]]\n[[es:Cormac McLaggen]]\n[[fi:Cormac McLaggen]]\n[[fr:Cormac McLaggen]]\n[[it:Cormac McLaggen]]\n[[nl:Magnus Stoker]]\n[[pl:Cormac McLaggen]]\n[[pt-br:C\u00f3rmaco McLaggen]]\n[[ru:\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043a \u041c\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0433\u0435\u043d]]\n[[Category:1970s births]]\n[[Category:Battle of Hogwarts participants]]\n[[Category:Blood traitors]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Dumbledore's Army]]\n[[Category:Foundables]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Hermione Granger's romantic relationships]]\n[[Category:Keepers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:McLaggen family|Cormac]]\n[[Category:Slug Club]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1990]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
