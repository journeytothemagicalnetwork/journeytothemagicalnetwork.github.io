She was excited to start Hogwarts.<ref name=\"Y5SQ\">{{HM|5|Yer a Prefect!}}</ref>\n\nEarly during her first year, she accidentally bumped into a female [[Ravenclaw]] (or [[Hufflepuff]] if Elora was a Ravenclaw) student's bag, causing the student's notes to go flying. She hit Elora with a [[Knockback Jinx]] in front of other students. The student also insulted Elora's house. Elora's side hurt following the event, but she was mainly embarrassed and went hiding.<ref name=\"Y5SQ\"/>\n\nHaving no friends, Elora sent messages to a [[Prefect]] [[Jacob's sibling|of her house]] and met them in the [[Artefact Room]]. Elora told them about what had happened and the Prefect told her they knew what it was like to be bullied. They then showed Elora how to brew a [[Wiggenweld Potion]].<ref name=\"Y5SQ\"/>\n\nAfter successfully brewing the [[potion]]\u00a0and [[Healing magic|healing]]\u00a0Elora with it, the Prefect offered to accompany Elora to their common room, but Elora refused, saying she couldn't leave. The Prefect then taught Elora how to [[Duelling|duel]]\u00a0on the [[Training Grounds]].<ref name=\"Y5SQ\"/>\n\nShe was watching as [[Emily Tyler]] read out [[Ismelda Murk]]'s diary in front of other Hogwarts students.<ref>{{HM|5|Crushed}}</ref> Later that school year, she was talking to [[Penny Haywood]] in the [[Great Hall]] when [[Ever-Bashing Boomerang]]s were unleased.<ref>{{HM|5|26}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Elora Dunn is always in the same house as the player.\n*Elora Dunn is only introduced to the player if they become a [[Prefect]] in {{HM}}. Later in the game, she can be seen in the background.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{HM}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Dunn, Elora}}\n[[ru:\u042d\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0414\u0430\u043d\u043d]]\n[[Category:1970s births]]\n[[Category:Blue-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1988]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
