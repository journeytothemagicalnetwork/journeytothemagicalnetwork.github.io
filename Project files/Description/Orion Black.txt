As revealed in ''[[Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies]]'', Chapter 3 (Horace Slughorn), Slughorn had \"completed half a century of service\" at the time of his retirement in [[1981]], meaning he started teaching there circa [[1931]]. Orion, born in [[1929]], attended Hogwarts from 1940/41 to 1947/48, and thus would have been a student of Slughorn and in his house.</ref> \n|loyalty = *[[House of Black]]\n*[[Macmillan family]]<ref name=\"BFT\" />\n*[[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]\n**[[Slytherin]]<ref name=\"slytherin\"/> \n*[[Death Eaters]] (indirectly)\n}}\n{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|Were \u2014 were your parents [[Death Eaters]] as well?|Sirius Black|No, no, but believe me, they thought [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] had the right idea, they were all for the purification of the wizarding race, getting rid of [[Muggle-born]]s and having [[pure-blood]]s in charge.|The Black family\u2019s views|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n\n'''Orion Black''' ([[1929]] \u2013 [[1979]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. He was the only son of [[Arcturus Black III]] and [[Melania Macmillan]]. He was the senior male-line descendant of the [[House of Black]], a family which could trace its magical ancestors back to at least the [[Middle Ages]] and which was recognised as one of the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]]''.

From left to right: Orion, [[Regulus Black|Regulus]], [[Walburga Black|Walburga]], and [[Sirius Black|Sirius]]]]\n\nAt some point, he married his second cousin [[Walburga Black]]. The two lived in their family home at [[12 Grimmauld Place]] in [[London]], [[England]]. Orion erected a vast array of magical security measures on the house while he lived there.<ref name=\"Security\">'''Sirius Black''': My father put every security measure known to Wizard-kind on it when he lived here. ({{OOTP}})</ref>\n\nOrion and his wife, like many members of the Black family, believed strongly in [[Blood status|blood purity]]. Their older son [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] disagreed with their bigotry, and when he was about sixteen, he ran away from home rather than remain with the family. Sirius moved in with the [[Potter family]], and in retaliation, Walburga burned his name off the family tapestry.\n\nOrion and Walburga favoured their younger son, [[Regulus Black|Regulus]], who echoed their belief system, and they approved when he joined the [[Death Eaters]]. They were not members of the organisation themselves, but they agreed with [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s values and goals. However, according to Sirius, they became dismayed when they realised how far Voldemort was willing to go to achieve his aims.<ref name=\"Ootp\">{{OOTP}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nOrion died in the same year as his son Regulus.<ref name=\"BFT\" /> It is not known whether he died before or after Regulus did. Kreacher did not mention him in his recounting of Regulus's death, but considering the great influence that Walburga had over her house-elf and younger son, that could mean nothing.\n\nOrion died two years before Sirius was falsely accused of mass murder and thrown in Azkaban.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Orion was shown to be proficient with the casting of security/concealment related charms, as whilst he resided at [[12 Grimmauld Place]], he cast on it every single security measure known to [[wizardkind]] to properly conceal it from [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] view. These charms were still effective long after Orion's death.<ref name=\"OOTP4\">{{OOTP|B|4}}</ref>\n\n==Possessions==\n{{Quote|When [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] wrested a large golden ring bearing the Black crest from his grip, Kreacher actually burst into furious tears and left the room sobbing under his breath and calling Sirius names [[Harry Potter|Harry]] had never heard before.|Orion's [[Sirius Black|eldest son]] throwing out his ring|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n*'''[[Orion Black's ring|Ring]]''': Orion owned a big, golden ring with the [[House of Black]] family crest. During the efforts to clean [[12 Grimmauld Place]], Kreacher tried to smuggle the ring to [[Kreacher's den|his den]], but Sirius caught him and wrestled it from his hands. Kreacher then cried furiously and cursed at Sirius under his breath. Sirius threw the ring out regardless.\n*'''[[Orion Black's old trousers|Trousers]]''': Sirius once caught Kreacher snogging a pair of Orion Black's old trousers.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Black family===\nIt is unknown what kind of relationship Orion had with his wife Walburga, but it is was probably at least civil since the couple shared similar opinions on blood purity and the rise of Voldemort. Walburga was the main parental figure in Sirius and Regulus's life, but Orion did not protest her decision to disown their son Sirius after he ran away or her brother Alphard when he left Sirius gold in his will.\n\nHe had a bad relationship with his elder son Sirius, who disagreed with Orion's bigotry. When Sirius ran away at the age of sixteen, Orion and his wife disowned him and seemingly had no further contact with him. His relationship with his younger son Regulus was better due to their shared beliefs in [[wizarding supremacy]], and Sirius believes he was proud when Regulus joined the Death Eaters.\n\n===Kreacher===\nKreacher wasn't as devoted to Orion as he was to Walburga, but he remained loyal enough to him after his death to try and save [[Orion Black's ring|his ring]] and to kiss [[Orion Black's old trousers|his trousers]].\n\n==Etymology==\nOrion, like many members of the [[House of Black]], is named after a [[Wikipedia:Orion (constellation)|constellation]]. Orion is a very prominent constellation, known as the Hunter. Contemporary astronomical imagery has Orion next to the \"river\" Eridanus and two hunting dogs, one of which contains the star Sirius, the name of Orion Black's older son. In Greek mythology, Orion was a giant huntsman who angered the gods, and was subsequently killed by the great scorpion after which the constellation [[Wikipedia:Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]] is named.\n\nIn other versions of the tale, Orion is actually killed by Artemis, Goddess of the Hunt, when she is tricked by her brother, Apollo, who is jealous of her love. Apollo bet Artemis that she couldn't hit a small mark down in a river, which was actually Orion's head, visible above the [[water]] as he was swimming. Artemis, not realising what her brother was making her do, shot Orion in the head. She then became distraught upon finding out about her mistake.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*According to [[Horace Slughorn]], who taught at Hogwarts while Orion was a student, every member of the House of Black except Sirius was Sorted in [[Slytherin]]. This would include Orion.\n*On the family tree in the film Orion has got a large blue turban, but on the 2nd DVD of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' his turban is red.\n*Orion might have known his fellow Slytherin [[Tom Riddle]] during their Hogwarts years. Orion attended the school from either 1940-1947 or 1941-1948 while Riddle attended from 1938-1945.\n*Orion and his son [[Regulus Black|Regulus]] died in the same year: [[1979]]. It is possible that Orion and Regulus's deaths, Regulus's defection from the Death Eaters, Orion and Walburga's disillusionment with Voldemort's methods, and Orion's preoccupation with the defences of [[12 Grimmauld Place]] coincide.\n*It is unknown why Orion put so much effort into magically protecting Grimmauld Place; he might have feared what Voldemort would do to the family once they began distancing himself from his methods, he might have feared the incursion of muggles and muggle-borns, or he might have simply been paranoid.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Orion Black}}\n*{{OOTP}} {{Mention}}\n*{{OOTP|F}} {{Comment|Appears on [[Black Family Tapestry]]}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{PM}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}[[de:Orion Black]]\n[[es:Orion Black]]\n[[fi:Orion Musta]]\n[[fr:Orion Black]]\n[[nl:Orion Zwarts]]\n[[ru:\u041e\u0440\u0438\u043e\u043d \u0411\u043b\u044d\u043a]]\n[[pl:Orion Black]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Black, Orion}}\n[[Category:1929 births]]\n[[Category:1979 deaths]]\n[[Category:Death Eater allies]]\n[[Category:English individuals]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts students during the Riddle-era]]\n[[Category:House of Black]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Married individuals]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Pure-blood supremacists]]\n[[Category:Pure-bloods]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1940s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
