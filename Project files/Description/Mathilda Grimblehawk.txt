This is my serious face.|Mathilda Grimblehawk|Fantastic Beasts: Cases from the Wizarding World}}\n'''Mathilda Grimblehawk''' (fl. [[1999]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] employed at the [[British Ministry of Magic]] as an investigator of [[creature]]-related incidents. During her years at the Ministry, she dealt competently with [[Wizardkind|wizards]], [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] and even [[Centaur]]s alike.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nMathilda Grimblehawk was born somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]], into the wizarding [[Grimblehawk family]]. During her formative years, she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where she was known to have taken [[Potions (class)|Potions]].<ref>{{FBC|6|4}}</ref> She presumably also took and excelled in [[Care of Magical Creatures]], given her future career as a [[Magizoologist]].<ref name=\"WU\">{{WU}} ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCIfSWgM See video])</ref>\n\n===Career===\nAfter she left school, she eventually joined the Ministry of Magic, where she became an investigator for the [[Beast Division]]. Along with [[Mathilda Grimblehawk's partner|her partner]] (the new intern) she helped investigate several cases involving [[magic]]al [[beast]]s. Their first case together involved an attack on [[Gordon Horton]], [[Quidditch]] [[keeper]] for the [[Chudley Cannons]].<ref>{{FBC|1}}</ref> She believed the Cannons to be the best [[Quidditch team]] in the league, despite their performance last season.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LCMPyqiQI8&feature=youtu.be Youtube - FANTASTIC BEASTS: CASES Android Gameplay]</ref>\n\nOther cases on which she worked included the disruption at the [[Leaky Cauldron]],<ref>{{FBC|2}}</ref> the attack on [[Don Harrison]]'s construction crew,<ref>{{FBC|3}}</ref> the story from the [[Siren's Rest's landlord]] of a [[Wales|Welsh]] lake monster,<ref>{{FBC|4}}</ref> the disappearance of [[Bilius Finbok]],<ref>{{FBC|5}}</ref> the investigation in the sewers of [[London]],<ref>{{FBC|6}}</ref> and the fire at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref>{{FBC|7}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Gethsemane Prickle]], she once, during the course of her duties, decided she would taste a [[Draught of Living Death]] before administering it to a magical creature. Mathilda begrudgingly admitted to it, saying that it had \"''only happened'' once\".<ref name=\"FBC2.4\">{{FBC|2|4}}</ref>\n[[File:Mathilda Grimblehawk from Harry Potter Wizards Unite.png|left|thumb|112x112px|Mathilda Grimblehawk during the [[Calamity]].]]\nBy [[2018]], Mathilda was working with the newly-created [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] to aid them in dealing with the results of the [[Calamity]]. As a [[Magizoologist]], she ministered the [[Ministry Magizoology Orientation|several]] [[Safety Orientation|courses]] for its members interested in pursuing a career as Magizoologists, including an intensive, week-long one centred on how to ride on a [[Kelpie]].<ref name=\"WU\" /> As a bat-expert, she also helped to improve members' insight into the [[Bat-Bogey Hex]].<ref>{{WU}} ([https://youtu.be/ysjsJI3NGv8?t=753 see video])</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nMathilda Grimblehawk possessed a great enthusiasm for the subject of [[Magizoology]] and great fondness for [[magic]]al [[creature]]s of all kinds. She was also very friendly and sociable, as she delighted in the chance to travel and meet new people as part of her work, and apparently greatly enjoyed [[Mathilda Grimblehawk's partner|her partner's]] company.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Magizoology]]''': As a member of the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]], Mathidla Grimblehawk was very familiar with a wide variety of [[magic]]al [[creature]]s, and knew how to [[Ministry of Magic Classification|classify]] them and the various laws regulating said creatures, as well as how to adeptly handle and understand them.\n*'''[[Martial magic]]''': As a field member of the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]], Mathilda would have become a fairly accomplished [[Duelling|duellist]], at least by the [[2010s]], as she would have received formal training in combative magic under the tutelage of [[Mordecai Berrycloth]] from the [[Auror Office]] as part of her preparations before joining the Statute of Secrecy Task Force.<ref name=\"WU\"/>\n*'''[[Potion]]s''': As a Hogwarts student, Mathilda was known to have taken [[Potions (class)|Potions]], a subject which she succeeded in, showing her to have been skilled in the art of potion-making.\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Mathilda was capable with charm-work, given how she often performed various charms successfully during her career investigations.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Mathilda Grimblehawk}}\n*{{FBC}} {{1st}}\n*{{WU}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{ICW}}\n{{Ministry Level 4 employees}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Grimblehawk, Mathilda}}\n[[pl:Mathilda Grimblehawk]]\n[[es:Mathilda Grimblehawk]]\n[[fr:Mathilda Grimblehawk]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0430 \u0413\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0445\u043e\u043a]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Brown-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Chudley Cannons supporters]]\n[[Category:Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures personnel]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Grimblehawk family]]\n[[Category:Magizoologists]]\n[[Category:Statute of Secrecy Task Force]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Unmarried individuals]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
