Fred was also a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]]; he fought in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] ([[1997]]) and was a commentator for ''[[Potterwatch]]'' during the height of the [[Second Wizarding War]].

In addition to his twin brother, Fred had three older brothers, [[William Weasley|Bill]], [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] and [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], and two younger siblings, Ron and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]]. The [[Weasley family]] was poor, but loving.\n\nFred and George enjoyed making mischief from a young age, and were quite a handful for their parents. It was not uncommon for explosions to be heard coming from the bedroom the two shared. They also greatly enjoyed teasing their brothers Percy and Ron. At one point, they even used their family's pet [[Weasleys' Puffskein|Puffskein]] for [[Bludger]] practice.<ref name=\"FB|R|An A-Z of Fantastic Beasts|Puffskein\">{{FB|R}}, ''(An A-Z of Fantastic Beasts), Puffskein''</ref> At the age of five, Fred [[underage magic|transformed]] Ron's [[teddy bear]] into a giant spider, sparking his arachnophobia, after Ron broke his [[toy broomstick]].

He was very popular among the Gryffindors in school, and he and George were well known for their senses of humour and pranks. The twins even set up their own joke shop in the disused bathroom on the seventh floor. Among Fred's many friends were: [[Lee Jordan]], [[Angelina Johnson]], [[Alicia Spinnet]], [[Oliver Wood]], and [[Katie Bell]]. During their first year at Hogwarts, Fred and George swiped the [[Marauder's Map]] from [[Argus Filch]]'s office.<ref name=\"POA\">{{POA}}</ref>\n\n====Second year====\nIn their second year, Fred and George became [[Beater]]s for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. They both used [[Cleansweep Five]] broomsticks and were so skilled at [[Quidditch]] that they were both described as being like \"Human [[Bludger]]s\".<ref name=\"PS\">{{PS}}</ref>\n\nIt was noted by Ron Weasley on the Hogwarts Express that Fred and George achieved \"really good marks\", at least in their early years.<ref name=\"PS\" />\n\n====Third year====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Molly Weasley|Fred, you next.|Fred Weasley|I'm not Fred, I'm George.

Fred and the other players believed that the addition of Harry would be a real shot in the arm to their chances of winning the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]]. Around the [[Christmas]] holidays, Fred and George got in trouble for bewitching several [[snowball]]s to follow [[Quirinus Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]] around, and hit him in the [[Tom Riddle#Search for the Philosopher's Stone|back of the head]] (they were, of course, unaware that they were throwing snowballs in Voldemort's face).\n\nThey stayed in the castle for the holidays along with their brothers and Harry, all of whom received [[British terms#J|jumpers]] from [[Molly Weasley|Mrs Weasley]]. The jumpers she sent to Fred and [[George Weasley|George]] didn't have their initials on them as Harry's and Ron's did, prompting them to call themselves \"Gred and Forge\". The twins also dragged [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] away from his fellow [[prefect]]s, insisting that Christmas was time for family, and stole his prefect badge, much to his irritation.<ref name=\"PS\" />\n\n====Fourth year====\n{{Quote|Someone's \u2014 tampered \u2014 with \u2014 this \u2014 Bludger \u2014 |Fred while beating the Rogue Bludger away from Harry|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\n\n[[File:Twins flying ford.jpg|246x246px|thumb|Fred, George, and Ron rescue Harry from the Dursleys]]\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Fred, George, and Ron rescued Harry from his relatives' home after not hearing from him during the previous summer month. They pulled the bars off his window and flew him to the[[the Burrow| Burrow]] in their father's [[Flying Ford Anglia|Ford Anglia]]. While at the Burrow Fred and George came to know Harry better as they spent time flying with him. The twins soon began their fourth year at Hogwarts, and took to teasing their younger sister [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] as she began her first year. They were trying to cheer her up, unaware that her emotional state was fragile due to the influence of [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|Tom Riddle's Diary]].\n\n[[File:Writing on wall students.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Fred, George, and others read the message about the opening of the Chamber of Secrets]]\n\nThat year, the Chamber of Secrets was opened and frighting messages were written on the castle walls. Rumours were circulating that Harry was responsible for it, since he spoke [[Parseltongue]] and thus might be the [[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]]. Neither Fred nor George took these rumours seriously, they found the whole thing laughable and frequently joked about it (apparently taking Harry though crowded corridors shouting, \"Make way!\"). They also came to [[Hermione Granger]]'s defence when [[Draco Malfoy]] called her a \"''filthy little [[Mudblood]]''\", by lunging at him, only to be blocked by [[Slytherin Quidditch team|Slytherin Quidditch]] [[Quidditch Captain|Captain]] [[Marcus Flint]].<ref name=\"COS\" />\n\nFred helped protect Harry form a rogue [[Bludger]] during Gryffindor's opening match against Slytherin. After Gryffindor won the Quidditch match, Fred went to the hospital wing with the rest of the Gryffindor Quidditch team to see Harry because [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] had removed all the bones in his arm, and congratulated him for his unbelievable flying, but not before seeing Marcus Flint yelling at Draco Malfoy for \"''having the [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]] on top of his head and not noticing''\", of which he informed Harry.<ref name=\"COS\" /> At the end of the school year, Fred was relieved when his younger sister was saved \u2014 and delighted when she revealed that Percy had a secret girlfriend, as this was another opportunity to take the mickey out of him.<ref name=\"COS\" />\n\n[[File:Weasley Wizarding Vacation in Egypt.png|235x235px|thumb|The Weasleys in Egypt]]\n\n[[Arthur Weasley]] had won a large amount of gold from a Ministry contest, something that was both a surprise and delight for the family. The Weasleys used the money won that summer to take a holiday to [[Egypt]], where the oldest son [[William Weasley|Bill]] was working as a [[Curse-Breaker|Curse Breaker]]. While there, Fred and George tried to push Percy, who had been acting even more arrogant and pompous than usual, because he learned he had been appointed [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]], into a pyramid. Their mother stopped them and scolded them severely. They and their brothers went in all the pyramids. They also annoyed [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] when she couldn't go in the last one, most likely because her their mother thought her too young.<ref name=\"POA\" />\n\n====Fifth year====\n{{Dialogue a-b|Oliver Wood|We've got two unbeatable Beaters.|Fred and George|Stop it Oliver, you're embarrassing us.|Pretending to be embarrassed at [[Oliver Wood]]'s praise|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\n\n[[File:Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban 0757.jpg|241x241px|thumb|left|Fred and George give Harry the Marauder's Map]]\n\nIn Harry's third year and their fifth, Fred and George gave Harry the [[Marauder's Map]], as they already knew it by heart and Harry needed it in order to sneak into [[Hogsmeade]]. They also tried to cheer him up after he fainted near the [[Dementor]]s that were guarding the school that year, due to [[Sirius Black]] [[Azkaban escapes#1993|escaping]] from [[Azkaban]]. Their attempt to cheer up Ron after his pet rat [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]] went missing was not as successful, as Fred and George reminded him that Scabbers was boring.<ref name=\"POA\" /> That year, they also won the Quidditch Cup along with Harry.\n\nFred and George began inventing magical prank items the summer of 1994, starting with the [[Ton-Tongue Toffee]], which Fred \"dropped\" near Harry's cousin [[Dudley Dursley]] in order to test it out, which proved to be  very successful. Fred also attended the [[Quidditch World Cup]] with his parents, siblings, [[Harry Potter]], and [[Hermione Granger]], and gambled all of his money on the outcome, which their father told them not to mention to their mother. When [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] defaulted on his bet, Fred was furious, and suggested that it was \"time to play dirty\" like Bagman by informing the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] of his activities. George was against the idea, arguing that it was blackmail.\n\n====Sixth year====\n{{Dialogue a-b-c-b|Ron Weasley|Dumbledore knows you're not of age, though.|Fred Weasley|Yeah, but he's not the one who decides who the champion is, is he?

That year, Hogwarts also hosted the [[Triwizard Tournament]], which Fred and George both wanted to enter, despite being underage. They attempted to fool the [[Age Line]] spell that [[Albus Dumbledore]] put around the [[Goblet of Fire]] using an Ageing Potion, but the attempt was unsuccessful, though they both thought their beards were uproariously funny.\n\n[[File:Fred&angela.jpg|231x231px|thumb|left|Fred attended the the Yule Ball with [[Angelina Johnson]]]]\n\nThe twins began trying out and selling their products, such as [[Canary Cream]]s, at Hogwarts as their sixth year began. When the [[Yule Ball]] was announced, Fred asked Angelina Johnson to attend with him, declaring it a \"piece of cake\" to ask a girl out. Angelina said yes and they went to the ball together. At the end of the school year, [[Cedric Diggory]], one of the champions, was murdered by [[Peter Pettigrew]] on the orders of the newly revived [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], who was reborn.<ref name=\"GOF\" /> Fred and George were surprised and very grateful when Harry gave them the thousand Galleons he won in the Triwizard Tournament in order for them to start [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|their joke shop.]]<ref name=\"GOF\">{{GOF}}</ref>\n\n====Seventh year====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Fred|That's not what he said.|George Weasley|Would you like us to clean out your ears for you?|Or any part of your body, really, we're not fussy where we stick this.|Shutting up [[Zacharias Smith]] by threatening him with a metal instrument|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n\n[[File:FredAndGeorge WB F5 AtGrimmauldPlace HP5-FX-00152r.jpg|250px|thumb|Fred and George in 12 Grimmauld Place]]\n\nIn the summer of 1995, before their final year at Hogwarts, Fred, and George passed their [[Apparition (class)|Apparition]] tests \"with distinction,\" and took to [[Apparition|Apparating]] and [[Apparition|Disapparating]] around [[12 Grimmauld Place]] to surprise people, much to the displeasure of their mother. They helped clean up the headquarters of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], but they also pocketed [[Doxy|Doxies]] from behind the curtains (and possibly [[Wartcap powder]]) for their experiments, and spied on the Order's meetings using the [[Extendable Ears]] they invented (although most of the time the Ears proved useless as the door was often [[Imperturbable Charm|Imperturbed]]).\n\n[[File:DA Luna Fred Ginny George Ron.jpg|240x240px|thumb|left|Fred and George during a [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] meeting]]\n\nFred and George resumed testing and selling their products at Hogwarts in their seventh year, though [[Hermione Granger]] managed to prevent them from testing out [[Skiving Snackbox]]es on unsuspecting first years by threatening to tell their mother.The twins also joined Dumbledore's Army to oppose the dictatorial running of Hogwarts under High Inquisitor [[Dolores Umbridge]], and to prepare to fight [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]].<ref name=\"OOP\"/>\n\nUmbridge kicked them both off the [[Quidditch team]] that year after George and Harry got into a fight with [[Draco Malfoy]], who had penned the demeaning song ''[[Weasley is Our King]]'' to humiliate [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and then proceeded to insult the Weasley parents and the late [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]]. Fred would have participated in the fight, but was held back by three of his team-mates. The Weasleys suffered a near-devastating blow that Christmas when [[Arthur Weasley]] was bitten by [[Nagini]], Lord Voldemort's pet [[snake]]. Fred was greatly upset by his father's injury, especially since [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] did not join his family at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]], deepening his estrangement.<ref name=\"OOP\"/>\n\n{{Dialogue a-b-c|Dolores Umbridge|You two are about to learn what happens to wrong-doers in my school.|Fred|You know what?

Fred and George decided that they no longer cared about getting into trouble, and that they were going to cause as much mayhem for Umbridge as possible. When the [[Inquisitorial Squad]] was formed and one member, [[Graham Montague]], attempted to dock House Points from them, Fred and George shoved him head-first into a [[Vanishing Cabinet]] before he could finish speaking.<ref name=\"OOP\"/>\n\n[[File:Screen Shot 2015-12-15 at 12.23.44 AM.png|250px|thumb|Fred and George during their escape from Hogwarts]]\n\nThey set off spectacular fireworks of their own creation, [[Weasleys' Wildfire Whiz-bangs]], which soon became best-selling products. After taking their disruptive activities easy during the Easter holidays, Fred dropped out of Hogwarts with George in a final act of rebellion against Umbridge. They left in a flourish of vandalism, chaos, and hexing members of the Inquisitorial Squad.

In fact, it was so successful that in [[1996]], the twins had moved out of their childhood home and into a flat above the shop; later, the twins considered buying [[Zonko's Joke Shop]] in [[Hogsmeade]], which had closed the previous year.<ref name=\"HBP\" />\n\n[[File:Fred&George_WeasleysWizardWheezes.jpg|246x246px|thumb|Fred and George standing in their new store]]\n\nNone of this would have been possible without the funding [[Harry Potter]] had given them in 1995.<ref name=\"GOF\" /> For Harry's generosity, the twins allowed him to take any merchandise free of charge. In the summer of 1996 Harry, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger]] visited the shop. Fred showed Harry around, showing him the wide verity of products in the back. He also offered Hermione a [[Patented Daydream Charm]] for free after she called them \"extraordinary magic\", but still charged Ron for his purchases. Ron also made some rude gestures at Fred for having him pay, which, to his misfortune, Mrs Weasley saw. Fred and George also questioned [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] on her love life and how she was moving through boys too quickly, much to her irritation.\n\n[[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-fred&george.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Fred and George stay at the Burrow for [[Christmas]]]]\n\nThat Christmas, the twins stayed at the [[the Burrow|Burrow]] for the holidays.

Ron and Harry came very close to forgetting their primary goal of hunting down Voldemort's remaining [[Horcrux]]es in the wake of Fred's death, being so enraged that they wished to hunt down Death Eaters to kill, with only Hermione's persuasiveness were they able to restrain themselves. Percy became extremely furious that he chased down Rookwood in an attempt at revenge, and Molly was utterly murderous when [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] mocked her of Fred's death, to the point of killing her with astounding duelling skills.

Volunteer members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] had to cast the [[Fire-Making Spell]] in order to disperse them.

The twins became friendly with him when he joined the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] as their [[Seeker]], giving them hope to win the [[House Cup]].<ref name=\"PS\" /> After Harry Potter's [[Skirmish in the Underground Chambers|encounter with Quirinus Quirrell]], the twins were responsible for trying to send him a toilet seat to amuse him, but it was confiscated by Madam Pomfrey because it wasn't very hygienic.\n\nThe [[1992|following year]], Fred and George cheered Harry up when many of the students believed that he might be the [[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]], which they scoffed at,<ref name=\"COS\" /> and the year after that, they gave him the [[Marauder's Map]] to help him sneak into [[Hogsmeade]].<ref name=\"POA\" /> They also stood up for Harry when others doubted his claim that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned or challenged his authority in [[Dumbledore's Army]], and assisted him in contacting [[Sirius Black]] when he told them and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] of his desire to speak to his godfather.<ref name=\"OOP\" /> Both twins risked their lives in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters|operation]] to remove Harry from his [[4 Privet Drive|relatives' home]] in [[1997]].<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\nThey seemed to regard Harry almost as another younger sibling, and were inclined both to be protective of him and teasing of him. Fred even stated that it was time for Harry to \"play with the big boys\" in Harry's third year when he was excluded from the Hogsmeade visit and Fred as well as George stayed behind with him. Harry was devastated by Fred's death during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] to the point where he felt like the world had ended, though he could not bring himself to join the Weasleys' small group around his body.\n\nHe eventually became Fred's brother-in-law through his marriage to [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]].\n\n====Hermione Granger====\n{{Dialogue|Fred|...we've decided we don't care about getting into trouble any more.|Hermione Granger|Have you ever?|Before the twins' escape from Hogwarts|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n[[File:DH Hermione in her red dress.jpg|thumb|[[Hermione Granger]], his friend and future sister-in-law]]\n\nFred became friendly with Hermione Granger after she became a close friend to his younger brother [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]]. Although Hermione disapproved of some of the twins' antics, since she was a [[Prefect]], she generally got on fairly well with them. They seemed to regard Hermione like a sister, due to her relationship with Ron and as she is always trying to keep them on track, despite being almost two years younger than them.<ref name=\"OOP\" />\n\nThey were outraged when [[Draco Malfoy]] called her a \"[[Mudblood]]\" in [[1992]], to the point of attempting to physically attack him.<ref name=\"COS\" /> Hermione also warned Fred and his twin brother that their [[Ageing Potion]] would not trick the age line protecting the [[Goblet of Fire]] due to the fact that Dumbledore would have thought of a foolish ageing potion in advance. They found out she was right when they were blown backwards and grew long, white beards. Fred and George also tried to get Hermione to relax, joking around with her about things such as their late uncle [[Bilius]]'s penchant for making mischief at weddings.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\nHermione also admired the twins' cleverness and creativity in their spell work, once remarking that they could do some \"extraordinary magic,\"<ref name=\"HBP\" /> though she did not agree with how they put it to use. Hermione was also one of the few people willing to stand up to Fred and George when she disagreed with them. For example, when she caught them testing sweets from the [[Skiving Snackbox]] on first-year students with [[Lee Jordan]], she was furious, and told them off for what she considered taking advantage of innocent children. Fred and George initially scoffed at her concerns and at her ability to make them stop, but backed down when she threatened to tell their [[Molly Weasley|mother]].<ref name=\"OOP\" /> However, the twins did not seem to hold a grudge, as they continued to be friendly; Fred even later gave Hermione [[Patented Daydream Charm|material]] from the [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|joke shop]] free of charge.<ref name=\"HBP\" /> She was saddened by the death of Fred, comforting a swollen-eyed Ginny.\n\nHermione would eventually become Fred's sister-in-law through her marriage to [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]].\n\n====Angelina Johnson====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Fred|Oi! Angelina! Want to come to the ball with me?|Angelina|All right, then.|There you go, piece of cake.|Fred asking Angelina Johnson to the Yule Ball|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\n[[File:GOF promo Angelina Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|[[Angelina Johnson]], his Yule Ball date]]\n\nAngelina Johnson was a [[Gryffindor]] in Fred's year at Hogwarts, and was on the house [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|Quidditch team]] with him and George. They were good friends; Fred asked her with complete confidence and rather casually to go to the [[Yule Ball]], and she accepted nonchalantly, but with \"''a bit of a grin on her face''\".\n\nThe [[1995|following year]], Angelina became Captain of the [[Quidditch team]] and was annoyed with Fred and George when they were kicked off the team by [[Dolores Umbridge]], as it hurt the team's chances.<ref name=\"OOP\" /> Angelina did not attend [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]]'s [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] as Fred's date, and he flirted with [[Delacour sisters' cousins|cousins]] of the bride while there. However, the two seemed to still be on friendly terms, as they fought alongside one another during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].\n\nAngelina would go on to marry George and they even named their only [[Fred Weasley II|son]] after Fred, as a means of honouring his memory.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n===Minerva McGonagall===\n[[File:Mcgonagall.jpg|thumb|[[Minerva McGonagall]], his former professor and head of house]]\n\nMinerva McGonagall was the [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] teacher during Fred and his brother, George's years at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Although McGonagall was always well known for being strict and stern, but she was never shown punishing or even telling off Fred and George for their wild behaviour and many pranks. It was known however that they were good [[Quidditch]] players from a good family, and she was visibly displeased with having Fred, George, and Harry kicked off the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]].\n\nMcGonagall often perceived the twins as troublemakers but seemed to share their dislike of [[Dolores Umbridge]], who was the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher for a small time. McGonagall did not attempt to remove the fireworks that surfaced around the school causing great disruptions. When Fred made his legendary escape in [[1996]], McGonagall assisted [[Peeves]] to unscrew an overhead chandelier. It was Fred's desire that such mayhem existed.\n\n===Lee Jordan===\n{{Quote|Listen, we're going down the middle of the train \u2014 Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula down there -|One of the twins on the Hogwarts Express in 1991|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}[[Lee Jordan]] was best friends with Fred and George during his time at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], and often got into trouble along with them. They were good friends and they both appeared to have affection for Angelina Johnson. In [[1995]] they joined [[Dumbledore's Army]] and Lee helped the twins harass [[Dolores Umbridge]], one incident of which resulted in him being punished by \"writing lines\", scarring his hand. In the [[1997\u20131998 school year]], during the height of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Fred was a guest on ''[[Potterwatch|Potter Watch]]'', the resistance radio show Lee hosted. In May of [[1998]], Lee returned with Fred and George to fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].\n\n===Filius Flitwick===\n[[File:Main1.png|thumb|left|Filius Flitwick, his former professor]]\n\nFred and George had a good relationship with many [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] professors. Professor [[Filius Flitwick]], the [[Charms (class)|Charms]] professor and [[Head of Ravenclaw House]], seemed to like them and he was very happy with their spell work. He also thought that they were very talented wizards and supported them in rebelling against [[Dolores Umbridge]] in [[1995]]. When Fred and George set off fireworks around the grounds she spent a day running around putting them out. After she had finished inspecting Flitwick's classroom, he told her that he could have put them all out easily, but was concerned he didn't have the authority to do so.\n\nAfter Easter break, the twins used one of their inventions, a [[Portable Swamp]] to change a corridor and several courtyards into swamps, shortly afterwards they departed from school to go into the world of business. Flitwick was seen cheering and supporting them at their departure after they circled around Umbridge and Filch. Flitwick was asked to remove the swamp they created, which he did but left a small patch in the corner as he believed it to be really good magic.\n\n===Rubeus Hagrid===\n{{Quote|I've spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the [[Forbidden Forest]].|Hagrid regarding the twins' mischief |Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}\n[[File:Rubeus.jpg|thumb|Rubeus Hagrid, his former professor]]\n\nFred and George were friends of [[Rubeus Hagrid]], the [[Care of Magical Creatures]] professor, throughout their time at Hogwarts. Hagrid seemed to be one of their favourite members of the staff, as he was not too serious and very tolerant, as many other professors were viewed as. They were also among the few people who still believed that Hagrid was a great person, even after they learned that he was a [[half-giant]]. Hagrid thought that Fred and George were trouble-makers, but still very funny.\n\nHe once compared them with [[James Potter I|James Potter]] and [[Sirius Black]]. Furthermore, they were all among Harry Potter's closest friends. Fred and George fought in the [[Second Wizarding War]] along with Hagrid. However, during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], he, [[George Weasley|George]], and [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] split up. Fred, meanwhile, met up with his older brother, Percy, and together they duelled [[Pius Thicknesse]]. However, Fred was killed in the explosion soon afterward.\n===Albus Dumbledore===\n[[File:600full-Albus-Dumbledore-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-photo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Albus Dumbledore]], his former headmaster]]\n\n{{Quote|We'd walk out right now if we weren't determined to do our bit for Dumbledore first.|Fred regarding causing mayhem under Umbridge|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n\nBoth Fred and George appeared to respect the headmaster Albus Dumbledore. They, like many others, thought that he was the greatest wizard of all time. He seemed to like them as well, despite the fact that they did stir up trouble; He knew they were good people at heart.\n\nAlong with George, Fred joined the [[Order of the Phoenix]], an organisation founded by Dumbledore, in order to oppose [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]. They also joined [[Dumbledore's Army]], in [[1995]], an army founded and led by Harry to oppose the Ministry's interference.\n\n===Argus Filch===\n[[File:Filch and mrs. Norris.png|thumb|Argus Filch and Mrs Norris]]\n\n{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|Don't tell me \u2014|Fred Weasley|Well, what would you've done?

Filch had punished them many times during their [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] years, because they were trouble-makers. Fred also \"nicked\" the [[Marauder's Map]] from Filch, while he and George were in trouble in his office. Filch had a great knowledge of all Hogwarts' secret passageways, only beaten by Fred and George's. When [[Dolores Umbridge]] was appointed at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], Filch supported her, and tried to punish the twins again. However, Fred and George escaped [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], flying with their broomsticks.\n\n===Severus Snape===\n[[File:Severus Snape Profile.jpg|thumb|left|Severus Snape, his former professor]]\n\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Fred|Git.|Hermione Granger|He's on our side now.|That does not stop him from being a git|Snape's behaviour towards them|}}\n\nFred and George disliked [[Severus Snape]] the potions master. Snape disliked them, too. This could be because of the fact that the Weasley twins were trouble-makers, like Snape's schoolboy rivals the [[Marauders]], especially [[James Potter I]] and [[Sirius Black]]. Snape was eventually charged with being Death Eater; however, he was a double agent and working for the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. He accidentally hit George with a [[Sectumsempra]] spell, while aiming at a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Fred never learned that Snape was on the Order's side due to the former's death.\n\n===Dolores Umbridge===\n{{Quote|Give her hell from us, Peeves.|Fred instructing [[Peeves]] to cause Dolores Umbridge havoc at Hogwarts, before his departure|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\nFred and George hated [[Dolores Umbridge]] with a passion, who was appointed by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] as the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor in [[1995]]. Umbridge was a sadistic woman who enjoyed punishing and torturing students. Almost every resident of Hogwarts at the time hated Umbridge, but she particularly hated [[Harry Potter]], Fred, and George. When George and Harry attacked [[Draco Malfoy]], Umbridge kicked them off the team, along with Fred. They also created a [[Portable Swamp]], in order to anger Umbridge. When she attempted to punish them, Fred and George insulted her in front of the whole school and then fled with their broomsticks.\n\n===Dumbledore's Army===\n{{Quote|Cough up, everyone, I haven't got enough gold for all of these....|Fred buying [[Butterbeer]]s for the DA at the Hog's Head Inn|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n[[File:Dumbledore's_Army.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Dumbledore's Army]], his allies]]\n\nIn [[1995]], Fred and George joined [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation founded and led by [[Harry Potter]], in order to oppose [[Dolores Umbridge]] and teach [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] to the other students. The twins knew most of them, and they had a good relationship with most members of the army, including Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Lee and Angelina.\n\nSome members of the army were also members of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], including [[Alicia Spinnet]] and [[Katie Bell]]. The girls appeared to be close with Fred, whom they possibly knew since their first year, as well as George. Both of them were very upset when Umbridge kicked Harry and the twins off the team. Fred met them again when they fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]].\n\nOther members of the army were [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Luna Lovegood]], [[Dean Thomas]], [[Seamus Finnigan]], [[Lavender Brown]], [[Padma and Parvati Patil|Parvati and Padma Patil]], [[Colin and Dennis Creevey]], [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], [[Hannah Abbott]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], [[Susan Bones]], [[Cho Chang]], [[Anthony Goldstein]], [[Michael Corner]], [[Terry Boot]], [[Marietta Edgecombe]] and [[Zacharias Smith]]. Fred was friendly with them, although not very close; however, he disliked Zacharias Smith, who didn't believe that Voldemort had returned, and did not fight at the Battle of Hogwarts, as did Marietta Edgecombe, who betrayed the army to Umbridge. However, the rest of them fought for Dumbledore's Army, and at least two of them, Colin Creevey and Lavender Brown were killed by Death Eaters.\n\n===The Marauders===\n{{Quote|Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers.|Fred's appreciation for the Marauders|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}\n[[File:Marauders 1997.jpg|250px|thumb|left|James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew]]\n\nFred and his brother [[George Weasley|George]] regarded the [[Marauders]] with a kind of idolatry and they believed that they owed a lot to them, as their invention, the [[Marauder's Map]], helped them to achieve a lot of their aims. Although they owned the map for many years, they did not refer to them as the Marauders, but instead they called them by their nicknames: [[Remus Lupin|Moony]], [[Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]], [[Sirius Black|Padfoot]], and [[James Potter I|Prongs]].\n\nWhile they were in possession of the map, the twins did not, however, work out that two of the Marauders were two of their friends in the [[Order of the Phoenix]]: [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Sirius Black]]. Neither were they aware that Prongs was in fact [[Harry Potter|Harry]]'s father, [[James Potter I|James]], and that Wormtail was actually [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] [[Peter Pettigrew]].\n\nHe and George were both friends of Sirius Black. Sirius was friendly with them, but he argued with the twins (for example: when he told them to wait at home while their father was in danger). Sirius was killed by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] in [[1996]]. The twins were saddened by his death, but tried not to remind Harry about it.\n\nThey were also friends of Remus Lupin, whom they first met in [[1993]], when he was [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor. They considered him among the best teachers of this lesson they had ever had. Lupin fought with the twins in many battles of the Second War, and was killed in the final battle, along with Fred. Their bodies were put near each other's in the [[Great Hall]].\n\nIt is unknown if the twins ever learnt the true identities of the Marauders, although it is possible they did eventually learn the truth after Voldemort's return considering that Sirius mentioned Pettigrew's nickname Wormtail in front of them while explaining Voldemort's intentions to them without them questioning that. It is also unknown if Lupin and Sirius ever learnt that the twins both had the Marauders Map in their possession during their time in Hogwarts.\n\n===Order of the Phoenix===\n[[File:Order of the Phoenix \u2013 first generation.jpg|250px|thumb|The original [[Order of the Phoenix]], his alias]]\n\nFred also became a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] during the [[Second Wizarding War]]. The Order was an organisation led by [[Albus Dumbledore]] in order to fight [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]. Fred had a good relationship with most members of the order. Some notable relationships include Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, his other family members (excluding Percy who had fallen out with the other Weasleys, and Ginny who was underage) and some of the Hogwarts professors.\n\nAnother member of the Order that they knew was [[Nymphadora Tonks]]. Tonks and the twins were close in age, and they were friendly. They fought together in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. Tonks was killed during the battle, too. Her body was put near Fred's, as well as Lupin's, after their death.\n\nThe twins also knew [[Alastor Moody]] and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]]. They appeared to have a good relationship, although they were not very close. When Moody was killed by Voldemort, everyone was sad. When the twins learned about it, they were joking with each other. They immediately stopped talking, and their expressions immediately switched to sadness. Kingsley survived the war and became Minister for Magic.\n\n==Media==\n[[File:Leejordan OoTP.PNG|2x2px|thumb]]<gallery width=\"200\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nFile:Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Clip) Harry escapes the Dursley's|Rescuing Harry\n</gallery>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Fred'' is generally considered a short form of the name ''Frederick''.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/fred Behind the Name\" Fred]</ref> ''Alfred'', and ''Wilfred'', along with now being a name in its own right[http://webspace.webring.com/people/ge/edgarbook/names/frames.html]. ''Frederick'' is the English form of a Germanic name meaning \"peaceful ruler,\" derived from ''frid'', \"peace,\" and ''ric'', \"ruler, power.\" It has been a very common name for rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, Germany, Austria, and Scandinavia, such as [[Wikipedia:Frederick the Great|Frederick the Great]] of Prussia.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/frederick Behind the Name: Frederick]</ref> Fred is also sometimes used as a diminutive of ''[[Wikipedia:Alfred (name)|Alfred]]'', derived from the Old English ''\u00c6lfr\u00e6d'', meaning \"elf counsel,\" or ''Alfrid'', meaning \"old peace.\" [[Wikipedia:Alfred the Great|Alfred the Great]] was a ninth-century king of Wessex who battled the Danes and translated many Latin books into Old English.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/alfred Behind the Name: Alfred]</ref> In Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish, ''Fred'' means \"peace.\"\n\nThere has been some suggestion that Fred and George are named after their maternal uncles, [[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]] and [[Gideon Prewett]], who were killed in the [[First Wizarding War]], who may have been twins, and who share Fred and George's first initials.\n\nAnother possible significance of the twins' names is that George III became king because of the early death of Frederick, Prince of Wales. George III was also deaf in one ear. [[J. K. Rowling]] has stated that she chose the name for liking and and finding it fitting  with the \"old-fashioned\" theme of the other Weasley brothers.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070724184310/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=72 F.A.Q. question] at [[J.

For the viewer to distinguish between Fred and George, actor James Phelps(Fred) is always placed on the left side of the screen and Oliver Phelps(George) is always placed on the right side of the screen, similar to how they are called \"Fred and George\". \n*He and George may have been the basis for Kaoru and Hikaru Hitachiin from the shoujo manga, \"Ouran High School Host Club\". They are both a pair of red-haired, mischievous twins.\n*[[Daniel Radcliffe]] plays Fred in the \"Seven Potters\" scene in his capacity as a decoy Harry.\n*Fred's last words were: \"You actually are joking, Perce \u2014 I don't think I've heard you joke since you were \u2014\"\n*In the games, they used to own a shop in a deserted bathroom in Hogwarts, where they sold Wizard Cards, Chocolate Frogs, Cauldron Cakes and other magical items.\n*Fred and George each earned fewer [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] than the rest of their brothers.\n*Fred and George were the only sons of Arthur and Molly Weasley who did not become [[prefect]]s during their education at Hogwarts.\n*When [[Harry Potter]] and his friends lost 150 [[House points]] in 1992, he lost favour with the Gryffindor Quidditch team. While understandable, it seems odd that Fred and George turned on him.\n*In the novels, the twins are described as being \"shorter and stockier\" and Percy and Ron as \"long and lanky,\" but in the films, Fred and George are taller and leaner than both Percy and Ron.\n*In her drawing of the [[Weasley family#Family Tree|Weasley family tree]], [[J. K. Rowling]] put the year of Fred's death down as 1997.<ref>[[Weasley family#Family Tree|Weasley family tree]]</ref> In canon, he actually died in May 1998.\n*His name was [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]'s last word, in the variation of \"Freddie.\" In the last film this line was cut out and instead it is George who calls Fred \"Freddie\" when asking if he was ready for battle. {{Dialogue a-b|George|You okay, Freddie?|Fred|Yeah|[[George Weasley]] and Fred, before the battle. George addresses his brother as 'Freddie'|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2}}\n*Despite the fact that they only earned three O.W.L.s each, in {{GOF}}, Fred mentioned that he was transfiguring a raccoon in [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]]. In {{OOTP}}, George said that he might be able to sell a \"few Extendable ears before [[Herbology]]\" and [[Lee Jordan]] said that Fred and George played [[Exploding Snap]] during [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], and that they had an inspected [[Charms (class)|Charms]] lesson.\n*Fittingly, Fred and George are born on April Fools' Day.\n*Fred and George might be named in honour of their mother's brothers Fabian and Gideon, as Fred and Fabian begin with the letter \"F\", and George and Gideon begin with the letter \"G\".\n*The only times Fred or George have been injured were when they were apart. They were split up at the time of Fred's death and when George lost his ear.\n*In {{DH|F2}}, it appears as though Fred is killed by a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] as the last moment seen of Fred is him scrambling on the floor with a Death Eater standing over him just as both start to cast a spell. However, due to the brevity of the scene, it escapes most people that the twin in this scene is George, not Fred. The twin in this scene is wearing a purple jacket, which is what George wears during the Battle of Hogwarts; Fred's jacket is green. Furthermore, the ear is also a clue, as it is mangled and has no earlobe. Fred's death is not seen on-screen much to the dismay of fans. It is not on the DVD version, or in the deleted scenes.\n*The only time Fred saw George as old men, was when they put their names into the [[Goblet of Fire]].\n*Oliver Phelps, who plays George, stated that it was quite upsetting for him to watch his real-life twin brother, James, act as if he were dead as Fred in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.\n*James Phelps admitted that when he was playing a dead Fred, he was actually asleep and the entire cast and crew went off to lunch without him, leaving him sleeping in the Great Hall set.\n\n===Author's comments===\n[[J. K. Rowling]] has commented that she always knew Fred was going to be killed in the series, though she guessed that readers would have expected George to die first, since he was the \"gentler\" of the two: ''\"Fred is normally the funnier but also the crueller of the two. So they might have thought that George would be the more vulnerable one and, therefore, the one to die... Either one of them would have been terrible to kill. It was awful killing Fred.
