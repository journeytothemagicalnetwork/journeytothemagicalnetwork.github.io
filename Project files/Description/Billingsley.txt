He appeared to be a very popular student who was known for his performance in [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] and [[Charms (class)|Charms]] classes, which many other students spoke about often.\n\n==Biography==\nBillingsley started attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in [[1983]] or [[1984]].<ref name=\"age\" /> He became very well known for the many ways he [[Transfiguration|transfigured]] objects, which was spoken about and often admired in [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] class by [[Jacob's sibling]]'s year.\n\nBillingsley's many achievements include turning a satchel to a [[goat]], the [[Minerva McGonagall|teacher]]'s desk to a ball of yarn, and himself to a surfboard which made McGonagall very upset with him. In an unknown way, Billingsley's head was once trapped in an [[Umbrella Flower]].<ref>[https://mobile.twitter.com/samantha_kasa/status/998098756791762944/photo/3 Twitter]</ref> He also [[Levitation Charm|levitated]] himself and the staff were unable to get him down for some time.<ref name=\"HM15c\">{{HM|1|5|c}} (see [https://youtu.be/uFcabB4K5CM?t=188 this video])</ref>\n\nHe was less skilled with charms-work, however. In his [[first year]], he recited an [[incantation]] incorrectly (presumably for the [[Fire-Making Spell]]), and accidentally set [[fire]] to the [[Boathouse]]. He also once spilled some [[Swelling Solution]] on the hands of [[Potions Master]] [[Severus Snape]].\n\nIn the [[1988\u20131989 school year]], Billingsley accidentally [[Transfiguration|Transfigured]] a [[ferret]] into a fountain [[Ferret to Feather Duster|instead]] of a feather duster. During the same year, [[Andre Egwu]] noted that animals seemed to hate Billingsley.<ref name=\"HM55t\">{{HM|5|5|t}}</ref> Later that year, Jacob's Sibling also recalled that [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] had made him dust her chalkboard after he transfigured her hat.<ref name=\"HM511t\">{{HM|5|11|t}}</ref> He also performed the [[Exploding Charm]] during breakfast, splattering [[egg]]s and [[bacon]] everywhere.<ref name=\"HM51\">{{HM|5|1}} -  Charms Class \"Bombarda Review\"</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]], sometime during [[1989\u20131990 school year]] Billingsley showed up to class in his jim jams.<ref name=\"HM625cmc\">{{HM|6|25|cmc}}</ref>\n\nAt some point during the [[1990\u20131991 school year]], Billingsley's [[Billingsley's niece|young niece]] was at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] as a visitor. When she saw [[Jacob's sibling]] sneaking in [[Fang]] (passing as a wizard who had been [[Transfiguration|Transfigured]] into a dog) to visit [[Rubeus Hagrid]] in one of the wards, she remarked it reminded her of a time her uncle had Transfigured himself into a [[parrot]] \u2014 she later added that even though he insisted he could [[Untransfiguration|Untransfigure]] himself, he was stuck as a parrot for three days.<ref name=\"HM720\"/>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': While Billingsley's charms were well known, they seemed to be often very unpolished, with his skills in this field of [[magic]] often being discussed by other Hogwarts students. His feats included recklessly using the [[Exploding Charm]] at breakfast and sending eggs and bacon everywhere,<ref name=\"HM51\"/> accidentally setting the [[Boathouse]] [[Fire|alight]] with an incorrectly recited [[incantation]], presumably with the [[Fire-Making Spell]] or a similar spell, and using the [[Levitation Charm]] to [[Levitation|levitate]] himself in the air, unable to get down for some time.<ref name=\"HM15c\"/>\n*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Billingsley was well-known for his frequent transfigurations, that were often comical in nature.<ref name=\"HM55t\"/><ref name=\"HM511t\"/><ref name=\"HM720\"/> It was said that animals used for Transfiguration seemed to hate him for his often bizarre [[Transformation]]s he performed on them.<ref name=\"HM55t\"/>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Billingsley was created by {{HM}} writer [[Matt London]], who wrote the story arcs for [[Year 1 in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery|Years 1]], [[Year 2 in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery|2]], and [[Year 3 in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery|3]]. He was meant to be whimsical, but likely due to London's departure from the creative team, he was reduced to only constantly being mentioned, without further development.<ref>[https://twitter.com/themattlondon/status/1017928335840534529 Sad to say I think Billingsley may have departed the game the same time I did. He was one of my more whimsical creations.
