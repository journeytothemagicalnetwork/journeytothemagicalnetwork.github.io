This might be a mistake on [[J. K. Rowling]]'s part, but it is possible that Sirius remembered his cousin Bellatrix (who presumably lived in [[12 Grimmauld Place]] before her marriage) spending time with her fellow future Death Eaters ''outside ''of school and simplified the connection when he was speaking to [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]].\n*[[Lucius Malfoy]] might have been associated with this group as well. He is familiar with Snape and many of the other members of the gang, and he attended Hogwarts around the same time.\n*There are members from the [[Avery family|Avery]], [[Lestrange family|Lestrange]], [[Mulciber family|Mulciber]], and the [[Rosier family|Rosier families]] in both this gang and in [[Tom Riddle's gang]]. Both gangs are noted for their membership with the Death Eaters, and considering the timeline, it is possible that they are sets of parents and children. The parents would have joined Tom Riddle's gang in the [[1940s]], and the children joined the Gang of Slytherins in the [[1970s]].\n*None of these individuals attempted to help Snape during [[Snape's Worst Memory]], even though Avery and Mulciber (whom [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]] singled out as his close friends among the gang) were probably in his year and would have joined the exodus outside after their Defence Against the Dark Arts OWL. It is unknown why, but considering how adamantly Snape defended them during the Prince's Tale, there might have been a hierarchy to their friendship in which the impoverished half-blood ranked lower than the two (presumed) pure-bloods. Alternatively, they had simply not lingered on the grounds and already gone elsewhere, and hence only learned about the incident after the fact.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{GOF}} {{1st Mention}}\n*{{DH}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Death Eaters}}\n\n[[es:Pandilla de Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Cliques]]\n[[Category:Death Eater allies]]\n[[Category:Death Eaters]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts students during the Marauders' era]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]"
