[[1970]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and the lead singer of the [[wizarding world]]'s popular band [[Weird Sisters|The Weird Sisters]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:076Wagtail.gif|thumb|Myron Wagtail on his [[Chocolate Frog Card]]]]\nWagtail was born some time in the year [[1970]], in [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]]. Attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from the year [[1981]] or [[1982]], he was a self-proclaimed fan of [[Jacob's sibling]] and invited them to perform with his band without the knowledge of the Hogwarts staff. The band and Jacob's sibling used [[Ismelda Murk]], [[Ben Copper]], and [[Severus Snape]] as inspiration for their concert. At this time in the 1980s, the band consisted of Wagtail, [[Kirley Duke]], and [[Orsino Thruston]]. Myron and [[Rowan Khanna]] shared an interest in postmodern existentialist fiction.<ref name=\"HM2\">{{HM|2|The Weird Sisters!}}</ref>\n\nWagtail, along with his band, performed at the [[Yule Ball]] of [[1994]] held at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in honour of the [[Triwizard Tournament]], by which time the band had at least eight members.<ref name=\"GOF23\">{{GOF|B|23}}</ref>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Wagtail appeared to be talented with charms, as he was able to use the [[Music Spell]] to enchant instruments to play on their own accord, and could use the [[Amplifying Charm]] to amplify the sound of his voice whilst performing.<ref name=\"HM2\"/> He was even capable of conjuring a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]],<ref name=\"LEGOHP\"/> a clear mark of superior [[magic]]al skill and talent given the immense difficulty of casting such a powerful protective charm. \n*'''Singing''': Being the lead vocalist for the very popular wizarding band the [[Weird Sisters]], Wagtail was a very talented and capable singer and live music performer. \n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:MyronWagtailLEGOHP1-4.png|thumb|Myron Wagtail in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]\n*[[Jarvis Cocker]] portrayed Myron in {{GOF|FA}}.\n*Jarvis also appeared in the movie ''Fantastic Mr. Fox'' as Petey along with [[Michael Gambon]] playing Franklin Bean, [[Helen McCrory]] playing Mrs Bean, and [[Alexandre Desplat]] composing the music.\n*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, Wagtail is an unlockable character, and is simply addressed as \"Vocalist\".<ref name=\"LEGOHP\"/>\n*He was at the school from [[1981]] to [[1988]] or [[1982]] to [[1989]], being only one school year ahead of or in the same year as [[William Weasley]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Myron\" is derived from Greek \u03bc\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (myron) meaning \"sweet oil, perfume\". Myron was the name of a 5th-century BC Greek sculptor.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Myron Wagtail}}\n*{{PS|G}} {{FWC}}\n*{{COS|G}} {{FWC}}\n*{{GOF}} {{1st}}\n*{{GOF|F}}\n*{{HBP}} {{Mention}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}} {{Comment|Appears as \"Vocalist\"}}\n*{{PM}}\n*{{HM}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Weird Sisters}}\n{{Chocolate Frog Cards}}\n[[de:Myron Wagtail]]\n[[es:Myron Wagtail]]\n[[fr:Myron Wagtail]]\n[[fi:Myron Wadtail]]\n[[it:Myron Wagtail]]\n[[pl:Myron Wagtail]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u043d \u0412\u043e\u0433\u0442\u044d\u0439\u043b]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wagtail, Myron}}\n[[Category:1970 births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Bronze Chocolate Frog Cards]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Weird Sisters]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
