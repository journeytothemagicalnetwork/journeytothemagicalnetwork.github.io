Her ancestors founded the [[Wigtown Wanderers]]. Her father, [[Ethan Parkin]], played for the Wanderers and was considered a Quidditch legend.\n\n===Hogwarts years===\nDuring her time at Hogwarts, Skye was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into an unknown House, which happened to be the same house as her father. At some point during her time at school, she became a [[Chaser]] on her House's [[Quidditch team]].<ref name=\"HM2Q11\">{{HM|2|Q1|1}}</ref> She played on a [[Comet 220]] [[Broomstick]] that had been passed down through her family.<ref name=\"Comet\">{{HM|2|Q1|9}}</ref>\n\n====1985\u20131986 school year====\nDuring the first practice match of the [[1985\u20131986 school year]], Skye saved [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Penny Haywood]] from getting struck by a [[Bludger]] that was heading towards the stands, hit by opposing player [[Erika Rath]]. However, while she saved them, her play cost her team by allowing the opposing [[Seeker]] to catch the [[Golden Snitch]] to win. During the match one of her team's [[Chaser]]s was injured to the point of being out for the season.\n\nPenny Haywood convinced her friend to pursue the vacant Chaser position. However, to make the team and earn a tryout invitation, training was needed, so Jacob's sibling sought Skye was out. After [[Rubeus Hagrid]] let her know who the student was, Skye opened about her weakness \u2014 [[Charms (class)|Charms]], her worst subject. Jacob's sibling offered to tutor her in return for training. Though initially sceptical of her schoolmate's ability in the subject, they convinced her to accept the offer. Although reluctant, Skye agreed to take the student under her wing in return for promising an immediate Charms lesson as she had an exam later that day.\n\nHowever, a windy day on the pitch meant that the lesson had to be cut short \u2014 the pages Skye tore out of her textbook had to be caught by her trainee before they blew away. Regardless, Skye gave Jacob's sibling a Quidditch lesson of her own, seeing if they were able to mount a [[Hurling Hex|hexed broom]]. Worried that she might be wasting time in lieu of keeping up to her family and her teachers' expectations, Skye called off the lesson early. \n\nShe explained that she was pressured by her father to win the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Hogwarts Quidditch Cup]] for her house. She revealed that even she would not have been able to mount the broom and it had been intended to be an excuse for her not to waste her time in training someone whose prospects she doubted. However, when her prospective mentee displayed natural Quidditch instincts while collecting the stray pages and mounting the hexed broom, Skye realised they could be the other Chaser her team needed to make the prospects of her house winning the cup a reality. Encouraged, she continued to serve as a mentor for the potential player.<ref name=\"HM2Q12\">{{HM|2|Q1|2}}</ref>\n\nAfter teaching Jacob's sibling the [[Parkin's Pincer]], a Quidditch move developed by her ancestors, Skye received the news that [[Ethan Parkin|her father]] had been injured during a match against the [[Montrose Magpies]] and was in hospital. This prompted her to return home temporarily to check on him and keep him company as he recovered. She assured Jacob's sibling that they would get a tryout invitation by the time she came back to school. Fortunately, her father was recovering quickly and Skye would not be gone long.<ref name=\"HM2Q12\" />\n\nWith her father getting better, Skye returned to Hogwarts just in time for tryouts. She, Captain [[Orion Amari]], and Jacob's sibling played one final practice match together before tryouts were to begin. Orion was impressed by Jacob's sibling's performance and offered them the position. Skye and Jacob's sibling began a friendship,<ref name=\"HM2Q12\" /> and the team later won the Final.<ref name=\"HM2Q113\">{{HM|2|Q1|13}}</ref>\n\n====1986\u20131987 school year====\nSkye continued to play Chaser during the [[1986\u20131987 school year]]. Some time that year, Skye received a new [[Comet 260]] [[broomstick]] from [[Ethan Parkin|her father]] as a gift to celebrate winning the final the previous year. She planned to give her mentee her old [[Comet 220]] as her friend had no broom of their own. Unfortunately, when they went to pick it up in the [[Quidditch Changing Rooms]], it had mysteriously vanished.<ref name=\"Comet\" />\n\nSkye was convinced that [[Erika Rath]] had stolen the broom, having developed a great dislike for the opposing [[Beater]] since being struck with Rath's [[Bludger]] to save Jacob's sibling from being hit in the stands at their first [[Quidditch]] match the previous season. To this end, Skye spread rumours about Erika taking the broom throughout the school, hoping to put pressure on her to return it.<ref name=\"Comet\" />\n\nIt eventually came out that Rath was innocent. A small pack of [[Rubeus Hagrid's Crups|crup puppies]] that [[Rubeus Hagrid]] was taking care of were teething and had somehow gotten ahold of the broom, chewing it to destruction. Hagrid felt responsible so, with the support of the team, he and [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] purchased a replacement [[Comet 260]].<ref name=\"Comet\" />\n\nThat season Skye felt under even greater pressure than before, especially after their team advanced to the finals and she learned that her father planned to come to watch. She was also greatly angered when she learned that [[Jacob's sibling]], who was playing a [[Beater]] that year, had begun training with [[Erika Rath]] to improve their skills, and the team's chances of winning the final against the strong opposing team. This put a strain on their friendship.<ref name=\"TLSQ2\">{{HM|3|Q2|12}}</ref>\n\n[[Ethan Parkin]]'s arrival at Hogwarts overshadowed the match itself. Not understanding [[Orion Amari]]'s softer, more holistic approach to team building, Ethan effectively took over team training before the final match, putting an even greater strain on the team dynamic, which had already been disrupted by the dispute between Skye and her friend.<ref name=\"TLSQ2\" />\n\nEventually Jacob's sibling and Skye confronted Ethan in the [[Quidditch Changing Rooms]] and Skye was finally able to open up to her father about the pressure she felt from him to live up to his, and their family's, legacy and how that had affected her enjoyment of the game. Ethan finally realised that, though he'd had the best intentions for Skye and the team, he had been overly hard on both. He agreed to step back, and also agreed to teach the team the [[Power Play]] manoeuvre that he had used to win the legendary [[1967 Hogwarts Quidditch final]] during his time playing for their House team.<ref name=\"TLSQ2\" />\n\nHaving finally released her frustrations, Skye was a lot calmed about playing Quidditch and began to mend her relationship with her friend. The team would go on to again win the final that year, using the Power Play to great effect.<ref name=\"TLSQ2\" />\n\n====1987\u20131988 school year====\nShe continued to play Chaser the [[1987\u20131988 school year|next season]]. She and [[Jacob's sibling]] worked to help Orion regain his mental balance when he was shaken up by being injured in an early game that year, and the subsequent argument between the two team because of this.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nSkye was a courageous yet competitive girl, given she had to carry Parkin's lofty standard as a Quidditch family. She was also good at multitasking, given that her family travelled often. For this reason, Skye preferred to travel light. To do achieve this, she tended to tear off pages in books, the problem being that a gust of wind can result in the pages scattering and becoming lost. Due to the pressure of both her family to succeed in Quidditch and her [[Professor]]s to excel in her classes, Skye was academically poor, especially in [[Charms (class)|Charms]], but began to improve with the help of [[Jacob's sibling]]'s tutoring.\n\nSkye tended to be impulsive and jump to conclusions, especially where [[Erika Rath]], a [[Beater]] for an opposing House that Skye greatly disliked, was concerned. After confronting her father about the pressure that she had felt to live up to their legacy, she was able to release much of her stress and became more relaxed, finally feeling able to enjoy the game she loved. \n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Skye was a highly accomplished and skilful [[broomstick]] flyer, having played [[Quidditch]] extensively and successfully before and during her Hogwarts years. She played [[Chaser]] for her House Quidditch team.\n*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Skye was shown to have a level of talent with the casting of [[dark charm]]s, as she could cast a proficient [[Hurling Hex]].<ref name=\"HM2Q12\">{{HM|2|Q1|2}}</ref>\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Skye was initially very weak in [[Charms (class)|Charms class]], but greatly improved due to tutoring from her friend [[Jacob's sibling]].<ref name=\"HM2Q11\">{{HM|2|Q1|1}}</ref>\n\n==Possessions==\n*'''[[Comet 220]]''': Skye owned a model of this racing [[broomstick]], which had been in her family for generations.\n*'''[[Comet 260]]''': Her father bought her this broom after she won her first Quidditch final.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Skye is the latest of the legendary Parkin family to join your house Quidditch team as a Chaser.
