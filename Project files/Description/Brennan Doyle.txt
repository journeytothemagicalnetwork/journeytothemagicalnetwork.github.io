Andre was already a Keeper in his fifth year.</ref>\n\nIn the [[1988\u20131989 school year]], he attacked Andre Egwu with the [[Conjunctivitis Curse]] during Quidditch training, wanting to play on the team instead of Andre. This lead to a series of events which resulted in Brennan to be kicked out of the Ravenclaw Quidditch team for his foul play.<ref name=\"HM5\"/>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Doyle was clearly an accomplished and talented [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player, given how he played as [[Keeper]] for the [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team]], which must demonstrate he had a high level of skill and experience in the [[magic]]al sport.<ref name=\"HM5\"/>\n*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Doyle had some skill with the casting of [[Dark charm]]s, given how he was able to successfully cast the [[Conjunctivitis Curse]] on [[Andre Egwu]] in [[1989]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*As Andre's direct predecessor as the Ravenclaw Keeper, he should be on the Ravenclaw team at the very least in the [[1987\u20131988 school year]] (as Andre is the Keeper in the following school year), which corresponds to Quidditch Season 3. However, for Ravenclaw players, this role is taken by [[Jacob's sibling]]. For non-Ravenclaw players, a [[Unidentified Seeker (II)|player]] resembling Brennan Doyle can be seen on the Ravenclaw team, but as a [[Seeker]] with a [[Unidentified Keeper (II)|different player]] as the Keeper.<ref>{{HM|4|Q3|1}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Brennan Doyle}}\n*{{HM}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Stub}}\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=Unknown\n|position=[[Keeper]] of the [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team]]\n|years=[[1980s]]\n|successor=[[Andre Egwu]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doyle, Brennan}}\n[[es:Brennan Doyle]]\n[[ru:\u0411\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u043d \u0414\u043e\u0439\u043b]]\n[[Category:1970s births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Brown-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Keepers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1982]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
