He was usually seen spending time at the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]] during the [[1996\u20131997 school year]]. He was a [[Gobstones]] player, and was one of the challengers [[Harry Potter]] had to beat in order to win the Gobstones Cup that year.<ref name=\"HBPG\">{{HBP|G}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Roderick\" means \"famous power\" from the Germanic elements hrod \"fame\" and ric \"power\". This name was in use among the Visigoths; it was borne by their last king (also known as Rodrigo), who died fighting the Muslim invaders of Spain in the 8th century. It also had cognates in Old Norse and West Germanic, and it was introduced to England by Scandinavian settlers and the Normans, though it died out after the Middle Ages. It was revived in the English-speaking world by Sir Walter Scott's poem ''The Vision of Don Roderick'' (1811).\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*This particular student was only featured in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|console versions]] of {{POA}} and the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|Nintendo DS version]] of {{HBP}}.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{1st}} {{C|Console versions only}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seaton, Roderick}}\n[[fr:Roderick Seaton]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Gobstones players]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
