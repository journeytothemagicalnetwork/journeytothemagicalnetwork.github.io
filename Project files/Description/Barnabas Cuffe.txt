As a child, he was very interested in the news, and enjoyed Slughorn's exaggerated outakes on the ''Daily Prophet''. He maintained a good relationship with Slughorn as he stated that Cuffe was always ready to take his [[owl]] on the day's news. He also enjoyed receiving [[vibe]]s as a means of communication.<ref name=\"HBP4\">{{HBP|B|4}}</ref>\n\nDuring Cuffe's leadership, the ''Daily Prophet'' was under a strong influence by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], which highly relied on the newspaper to assure the support of the British wizarding community.<ref name=\"WW\">{{WW|the-daily-prophet}}</ref>\n\nAside from being the paper's editor, Cuffe occasionally wrote articles for the ''Prophet''. One such article, entitled \"The Wizarding World in Mourning\", covered the then-recent death of [[Albus Dumbledore]].<ref name=\"HPLE\">{{HPLE}} (see [[:File:DumbledoreObituary.JPG|this image]])</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Barnabas\" is the Greek form of an Aramaic name. In Acts in the New Testament the byname Barnabas was given to a man named Joseph, a companion of Paul on his missionary journeys. The original Aramaic is unattested, but it may be from \u05d1\u05bc\u05e8 \u05e0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0 (bar naviya') meaning \"son of the prophet\", though in Acts 4:36 it is claimed that the name means \"son of encouragement\". As an English name, it came into occasional use after the 12th century.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Barnabas Cuffe was portrayed by [[Roger C.
