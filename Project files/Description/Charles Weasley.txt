[[12 December]],<ref name=\"mugglenet\" /> [[1972]])<ref name=\"year\" /><ref name=\"HM-year\"/> was an [[England|English]] [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], the second eldest son of [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Molly Weasley]] {{c|n\u00e9e Prewett}}, younger brother of [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and the elder brother of [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], [[George Weasley|George]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], and the late [[Fred Weasley]]. \n\nHe attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1984]]\u2013[[1991]] and was sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]. He was both a [[Prefect]] and [[Quidditch]] [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] during his time at school, after which he went to study [[dragon]]s in [[Romania]].\n\nDuring the [[Second Wizarding War]], Charlie was a member of the second [[Order of the Phoenix]] and fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]], arriving with reinforcements during the final portion of the battle. He was also present when [[Harry Potter]] defeated [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] once and for all.\n\nCharlie survived the Second Wizarding War and continued his work with [[dragon]]s. He never married and had no children,<ref>''[[J.K. Rowling: A Year in the Life]]''</ref> but through his siblings and their respective marriages, he had many nieces and nephews.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life {{C|1972\u20131983}}===\n{{Quote|My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures...|[[Percy Weasley]] regarding his older brother|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\nCharles Weasley was the second of seven children born to [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Molly Weasley]].<ref name=\"COS4\">{{COS|B|4}}</ref> He was a child during the height of the [[First Wizarding War]]. In the fighting, his maternal uncles, [[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]] and [[Gideon Prewett]], both members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], were murdered fighting [[Antonin Dolohov]] and four other [[Death Eaters]].<ref name=\"OOTP9\">{{OOTP|B|9}}</ref> While he was still a child, the wizarding world became peaceful again (for a time) after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s first defeat on [[31 October]], [[1981]].\n\n[[File:The Burrow.png|235x235px|thumb|[[The Burrow]], where Charlie grew up with his family]]\nCharlie and his five brothers \u2014 Bill, Percy, Fred, George, and Ron \u2014 as well as his younger sister, Ginny,<ref name=\"PS6\">{{PS|B|6}}</ref> grew up in the Burrow on the outskirts of [[Ottery St Catchpole]] in [[Devon]], [[England]]. Like all his siblings, he was home educated in reading, writing and simple maths by his mother. The Weasley family was not wealthy compared to other wizarding families. Many other [[pure-blood]] families, particularly the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]], disdained them for their \"''blood traitor''\", pro-Muggle beliefs and their lack of wealth.<ref name=\"COS7\">{{COS|B|7}}</ref> They tried their best to make up for this with their [[love]]. It can be assumed that Charlie had a fairly happy childhood, as all the Weasley siblings did.\n\nCharlie showed a keen interest in [[Dragonologist|Dragonology]] from a young age. During a game of truth-or-dare with friends sometime during in [[1989\u20131990 school year|1989\u20131990]], [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] revealed that, in his youth, Charlie used to try and turn the family pets into dragons. Since this was before he started at Hogwarts and knew any spells, he would settle on sticking paper wings on [[Peter Pettigrew#Scabbers|Scabbers]] using [[Spellotape]] and on making Errol fly around with a dragon mask, and then following them around while jotting down his \"observations of dragon behaviour\".<ref name=\"HM6\">{{HM|6|THE DRAGON'S TREASURE|3}}</ref>\n\n===Hogwarts years {{C|1984\u20131991}}===\nOn [[1 September]] [[1984]], Charlie started his first term at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]] like the rest of his family, and was in the same year as [[Hufflepuff]] [[Nymphadora Tonks]]. By the end of his second year, Charlie became the [[Seeker]] of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]].<ref>Charlie was playing in the Gryffindor Quidditch team during their most recent victory as of [[1993]], which was in [[1986]].</ref> He greatly excelled in the position.\n\n====Third and fourth years====\nIn his [[third year]], Charlie elected to take [[Care of Magical Creatures]]<ref name=\"COS14\">{{COS|B|14}}</ref> class, since he liked working outdoors, and [[Muggle Studies]].<ref>{{HM|7|3}}</ref> It was around this time that he sneaked into the [[Forbidden Forest]], having become convinced that he could catch a dragon in there. Well aware of the dangerous creatures within, Bill reluctantly accompanied him so his little brother would not have to face such dangers on his own.<ref name=\"y4ch4\">{{HM|4|4}}</ref> He would later admit to [[Jacob's sibling]] how he had been sneaking into the Forbidden Forest more often than Bill or the teachers knew about. In the forest he had met and befriended a centaur by the name of [[Torvus]], though he seldom talked about it because he did not want to brag or know where he sometimes went off to.\n\nIn his [[fourth year]], Charlie was involved in Jacob's sibling's search for the [[Forest Vault]], and joined them many times in searches in the Forbidden Forest.<ref>{{HM|4}}</ref>. He entered the Forest Vault along with Jacob's sibling, [[Rubeus Hagrid]], Torvus and another student (either [[Rowan Khanna]], [[Penny Haywood]] or Bill Weasley). In the vault, he was excited to see a dragon portrait.<ref>{{HM|4|16}}</ref>\n\n====Fifth year====\n[[File:Charles.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Charlie during his hogwarts years]]\nBy his [[fifth year]], Charlie was appointed as a prefect.<ref name=\"OOTP9\" /> Near the beginning of his fifth year, he joined a study session with his brothers Bill and Percy, as well as Jacob's sibling.<ref>{{HM|5|1}}</ref> That year, he and Jacob's sibling also sold items and worked to get money to buy a [[dragon egg]] from the suspicious [[Alistair Fidgen]], although this egg later turned out to be an [[Acromantula]] egg. However, as Charlie got a piece of a dragon, he was nonetheless satisfied.<ref>{{HM|5|Egg Hunt}}</ref>\n\nLater that year, Charlie, Bill, Percy and Jacob's sibling asked [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly Headless Nick]] questions about the Marauder's Map. Charlie got excited when Sir Nicholas mentioned that [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] had believed there had been a dragon in the castle. Later, Charlie and Bill went to the [[Prefects' Bathroom]] to look for [[Duncan Ashe]]. Charlie was disappointed when Duncan left before he had a chance to ask about the dragon.<ref>{{HM|5|6}}</ref>\n\n====Sixth and seventh years====\nCharlie eventually became [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] of the Gryffindor Quidditch team<ref name=\"PS9\">{{PS|B|9}}</ref> at some point in his fifth year or later.<ref>{{HM}} - as Charlie had not been to the [[Prefects' Bathroom]] before he became a Prefect and got a tour from Bill at the beginning of his fifth year, it is unlikely he was a Quidditch Captain the previous year, as that would have given him access to the Prefects' bathroom.</ref> After he left Hogwarts, the [[Seeker]] position for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] was taken by [[Harry Potter]] and the Quidditch Captain position was taken by [[Keeper]] [[Oliver Wood]].\n\nEarly in his [[sixth year]], Charlie considered dropping out of Hogwarts due to what had happened in the [[Buried Vault]] in the [[1988\u20131989 school year|previous school year]]. However, [[Jacob's sibling]] convinced him to finish his education.<ref>{{HM|6|4}}</ref>\n\nSometime during the year, Charlie became a founding member of the [[Circle of Khanna]], a group devoted to avenging [[Rowan Khanna]] and locating the [[Sunken Vault|final Cursed Vault]]. It was at the groups first meeting in the [[Hog's Head Inn]] that he learned of the malevolent organisation \"[[R]]\" and it's [[Plot to find the Cursed Vaults|motives]] to locate the final Cursed Vault before them.<ref name=\"hm20\">{{HM|6|20}}</ref>\n\nCharlie took his [[Apparition]] test twice. He failed on the first attempt, materialising five miles south of his target location on top of an old [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] woman doing her shopping. He passed on the second attempt. His brothers [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]] made fun of this, but not to his face.<ref name=\"GOF6\">{{GOF|B|6}}</ref>\n\nPrior to his graduation, Charlie was given a Quidditch Trophy.<ref>[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/5/59/TrophyNameProductionList.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161206202042 The Trophy List] in 1991 has Charlie listed under: ''Quidditch Trophies.

The dragon, a [[Norwegian Ridgeback]] named [[Norberta|Norbert]], was being illegally kept, but Ron \u2014 along with his friends [[Harry Potter]] and [[Hermione Granger]] \u2014 did not want their friend to get into trouble. Charlie, who had always got on well with Hagrid because of their shared love of dragons, agreed to help and arranged for [[Charles Weasley's colleagues|some of his friends]] to pick up Norbert and deliver him to the dragon sanctuary in Romania where he worked.<ref name=\"PS14\">{{PS|B|14}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Weasley Wizarding Vacation in Egypt.png|235x235px|thumb|left|Charlie with his [[Weasley family|family]] in Egypt]]\nIn [[1993]], Charlie joined the rest of his family for a holiday in [[Egypt]] after his father won seven hundred galleons in the annual ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' Grand Prize Galleon Draw.<ref name=\"POA1\">{{POA|B|1}}</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of [[1994]], Charlie returned to [[the Burrow]] to attend the [[Quidditch World Cup]] with the rest of his family.

They were transported over using a [[Sleeping Draught]], and he did not dare tell his mother about them considering that she was still angry about Harry being allowed to compete in the Tournament.<ref name=\"GOF19\">{{GOF|B|19}}</ref> He remained on hand during the Task in case the dragons got out of hand, and congratulated Harry on beating the [[Hungarian Horntail]].<ref name=\"GOF20\">{{GOF|B|20}}</ref> He relayed Harry's performance to Bill, saying it was \"incredible.\" He attempted to get time off of work to attend the Third Task, but was unable to.<ref name=\"GOF31\">{{GOF|B|31}}</ref>\n\n===Second Wizarding War {{c|1995\u20131998}}===\n====Recruiting foreign wizards====\n{{Quote|Charlie's in the Order, too, but he's still in Romania. Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible, so Charlie's trying to make contacts on his days off.|Explanation of Charlie's part in the Order|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\nWhen [[Albus Dumbledore]] reconstituted the [[Order of the Phoenix]] to oppose [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], Charlie joined alongside his family. While his brother Bill returned to England to better serve the Order, Charlie remained in Romania and was assigned to recruit foreign wizards to the cause.<ref name=\"OOTP4\">{{OOTP|B|4}}</ref>\n\n====Bill and Fleur's wedding====\n[[File:Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Bill and Fleur's wedding that Charlie attended as the best man]]\nIn the summer of [[1997]], Charlie once more returned to the Burrow, to serve as best man at Bill's [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] to [[Fleur Delacour]].<ref name=\"DH6\">{{DH|B|6}}</ref> During a birthday celebration for Harry the day before the wedding, he informed Hagrid that Norbert was doing well \u2014 and was now called [[Norberta]] since they had discovered, to Hagrid's surprise, that the dragon was actually a female.<ref name=\"DH7\">{{DH|B|7}}</ref>\n\nWhen the wedding was broken up by Death Eaters in the wake of the fall of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]],<ref name=\"DH8\">{{DH|B|8}}</ref> he was questioned alongside his family but was unharmed. He presumably returned to Romania, as both his father and brothers were allowed to return to work.\n\n====[[Battle of Hogwarts]]====\n{{Quote|They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted toward the castle, uttering loud war cries.|Reinforcements arriving during the second half of the final battle|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\n[[File:Hogwarts Big Battle at Hogwarts Moment Pottermore.jpg|250px|thumb|Charlie and others arrive for the second half of the Battle of Hogwarts]]\nWhile the rest of the Weasley family answered [[Neville Longbottom]]'s call to arms to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts, Charlie did not join them immediately. This was possibly due to being out of the country at the time. During this time, his younger brother Fred was tragically killed during the first half of the battle. This was something Charlie was initially unaware of, as he was not present during the one-hour armistice.<ref name=\"DH32\">{{DH|B|32}}</ref>\n\nHowever, he did arrive toward the end of the battle alongside [[Horace Slughorn]]. He and Horace lead hundreds of reinforcements consisting of the residents of [[Hogsmeade]] and the friends and family of all the Hogwarts students who had chosen to stay and fight Voldemort and his Death Eater army. These reinforcements changed the tide of the battle in the favour of the Defenders of Hogwarts.<ref name=\"DH36\">{{DH|B|36}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Voldemort vanquished.png|250px|thumb|left|Charlie and the other defenders of Hogwarts watch [[Harry Potter]]'s final defeat of Lord Voldemort]]\nArriving just as Neville slayed [[Nagini]], he led them into battle against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Death Eaters]], strengthening the weakened defenders of the castle. With the added fighters the defenders of Hogwarts were able to push Voldemort's army back, until only Bellatrix and the Dark Lord himself were the only two left. He also witnessed [[Molly Weasley|his mother]] killing [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] and Harry defeating and killing Lord Voldemort once and for all.<ref name=\"DH36\"/> It can be assumed that after the battle ended he sat with his family and mourned Fred as well as the others that had fallen.\n\n===Later life===\nFollowing the war, Charlie did not marry or have children, as he was more interested in studying dragons than in forming a romantic attachment. However, he had many nieces and nephews through all of his living siblings. \n\nAs of the summer of [[2014]], he was still unmarried, which prompted the nosy journalist [[Rita Skeeter]] to wonder what were the reasons behind his prolonged celibacy.<ref name=\"DP08jul14\">{{PM}} - [[DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP FINAL]] (Archived)</ref>\n\nIn [[2019]], [[Magizoologist|at least one]] member of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] visited the [[Romanian Dragon Sanctuary]] to study dragons, where they ended up being grouped together with Charlie. While there, Charlie held a [[Nowhere to Hide|course]] that would allow them to spot weaknesses in dragon's hide, which would later help them [[Calamity|in the field]],<ref name=\"WU 1\">{{WU}} ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCIfSWgMX-c&t=8s see video])</ref> along with aiding them in their study of the creatures to increase the amount of damage they can deal. In addition, he was also joined with said member in the grand opening of [[Chinese Dragon Sanctuary]], where from witnessing the precision and power of a [[Chinese Fireball]], they increased their damaging power\n\n==Physical appearance==\nCharlie was short and stocky, and he had muscled arms. His face was weather beaten from working outdoors and was so freckled that he looked tanned. His fingers were usually covered in calluses and blisters, and, on one occasion during the summer of 1994, he had a large shiny burn on one of his arms.<ref name=\"GOF5\"/> Like all the [[Weasley family]], Charlie had red hair. It is possible he had long(ish) hair, as in 1997, on the day of Harry's seventeenth birthday, [[Molly Weasley|Molly]] forcefully cut his hair \"brutally short.\"<ref name=\"DH7\"/>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Dragons are all I care about. Who has time for dating when there are so many dragons to study?|Charlie Weasley to Jacob's sibling|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\nCharlie was described by his brother Percy as being \"''always more of an outdoor type''.\" During his years at Hogwarts, Charlie liked animals and magical creatures; he later went to [[Romania]] in order to study about dragons. He also appeared to be friendly with his siblings, [[Rubeus Hagrid]], and [[Harry Potter]], but he did not like the fact that his mother used to cut his hair short.<ref name=\"DH7\"/>\n\nCharlie was also brave, as he was sorted into [[Gryffindor]] house and fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against Voldemort.<ref name=\"DH36\"/> During his Hogwarts years also he participated in many dangerous adventures. After the war, Charlie did not marry or have his own family.<ref>{{HPM}} -  When asked, [[J. K. Rowling]] said he was not gay despite his lack of interest in women, instead preferring to continue studying dragons.</ref>\n\nHe was slightly clumsy at times, for example he had knocked over an expensive display at the [[Zonko's Joke Shop]], and only a few days later fell from a ladder while decorating the [[Great Hall|Hogwarts Great Hall]].\n\nHe was cool-natured, but didn't like it when people teased him about his obsession with dragons, which was seen when he left his group at the [[Romanian Dragon Sanctuary]] and almost got killed by a Hungarian Horntail. He displayed extreme bravery as well during that time, and was sorry for losing his temper.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': Charlie was revealed to have taken the subject of Care of Magical Creatures during his Hogwarts years. It appeared that he was particularly talented in the subject, for even [[Rubeus Hagrid]] (who himself had remarkable skills in handling magical creatures) commented that Charlie was ''\"great with animals\"''. After graduating from Hogwarts, Charlie went to [[Romania]], studying [[dragon]]s,<ref name=\"PS8\"/> which was proof of his talent in [[Magizoology]], given how dragons were incredibly powerful and dangerous [[beast]]s to handle. He was skilled enough with dragon handling, that he helped to handle them during the [[Triwizard Tournament]].<ref name=\"GOF19\"/><ref name=\"GOF20\"/>\n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': During his Hogwarts years, Charlie was the [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] as well as [[Seeker]] of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. He was an excellent [[Quidditch]] player, having helped Gryffindor win the Quidditch Cup many times. [[Oliver Wood]] also claimed that Charlie could have played for [[England]]'s national team if he wanted to, showing him to have been a highly talent and accomplished [[broomstick]] flyer.<ref name=\"PS10\"/>\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': Charlie was shown to have considerable skill as a duellist, given how he participated in and survived the final fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], showing him to have had much proficiency and skill in [[martial magic]].<ref name=\"DH36\"/>\n*'''[[Apparition]]''': Like most adult wizards, Charlie could apparate at will. He learned how to apparate successfully after passing his Apparition test for the second time.<ref name=\"GOF6\"/>\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Charlie was competent with the casting of charms, such as with the [[Levitation Charm]] and [[Exploding Charm]]. He was also able to produce a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]],<ref name=\"LEGOY2\"/> a mark of superior [[magic]]al ability given the immense difficulty of casting the charm.\n*'''[[Muggle Studies]]''': Charlie learned much about [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] artefacts from his [[Arthur Weasley|father]]. He earned an [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] in Muggle Studies and took the subject at [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] level.<ref name=\"HM73\">{{HM|7|3}}</ref>\n*'''Tracking skills''': Charlie had a talent for tracking the movements of magical creatures. At some point during his student years, he 'got it in his head' that he would be able to catch a [[dragon]] in the [[Forbidden Forest]]. Bill attributed the fact that they neither starved or were attacked by any of the dangerous creatures dwelling in the woods due to Charlie's tracking skills.<ref name=\"y4ch4\" />\n*'''Social networking''': Charlie had very strong connections with foreign wizards and [[magic]]al [[creature]]s, along with the ones he had with wizards and magical creatures in [[Great Britain|Britain]]. This was first evident when Charlie had some of his friends bring [[Norberta|Norbert]] to him from [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], despite the risks involved with it.<ref name=\"PS14\"/> Due to these skills, [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] gave Charlie the task of recruiting foreign wizards into the [[Order of the Phoenix]].<ref name=\"OOTP4\"/> Charlie's social networking skills later allowed him to gather reinforcements to fight against [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s forces, an act which would later prove to be vital for Voldemort's [[Voldemort's Last Stand|final defeat]] and ending the [[Second Wizarding War|war]].<ref name=\"DH36\"/>\n\n==Possessions==\n*'''[[Charles Weasley's wand|First wand]]''': Charlie owned an Ash wand with a unicorn hair core. His younger brother Ron used this wand from 1991 to 1993.\n*'''Messenger bag''': Charlie owned a messenger bag which he used at school. The messenger bag had a silver dragon head on the strap.\n*'''[[Prefect badge]]''': Having been made prefect in his [[fifth year]] at Hogwarts, Charlie owned a Gryffindor prefect badge, which he wore during his formal prefect duties.\n*'''[[Hebridean Black]] scale''': At some point before their [[sixth year]], Jacob's sibling gave him a Hebridean Black scale.\n*'''[[Crup]]py''': Charlie owned and raised a Cruppy he named Dragon.\n*'''Second wand''': Charlie owned another wand from at least 1991.\n*'''[[Fireproof balaclava]]''': Charlie had a fireproof balaclava which he used at work.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Family===\n====Weasley family====\n[[File:Weasley family.png|250px|thumb|The [[Weasley family]]]]\n\nCharlie had a good relationship with his family. [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Molly Weasley]] both were [[pure-blood]] wizards who loved their children very much and cared about them. However, they were economically poor and were considered by many as \"blood-traitors,\" because they were not prejudiced against [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s and [[Muggle-born]]s. Charlie's childhood might have been happy and friendly with his parents.\n\nHe also had a good relationship with his siblings. He appeared to be closest with [[William Weasley|Bill]], because they were close in age. Bill was a good student, like Charlie; after [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], Bill worked for [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] in [[Egypt]], and later married [[Fleur Delacour]]. Charlie was the best man at [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|their wedding]]. It is possible that, after the war, they were as close as they were during their early years.\n\nCharlie appeared to have a good relationship with his younger siblings, too. [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] believed that Charlie was \"more of an outdoor type\"; the reason that he liked studying dragons. Percy seemed to be proud that his brother was a good student, but they were not on good terms during the [[Second Wizarding War]]; Percy believed that his family was wrong for supporting Dumbledore. After the war, Percy changed his mind and his relationship with his siblings became better.\n\n[[Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] seemed to like Charlie; they tended to look up to Charlie as much as Bill. During their early years, Charlie might have been close with them, but he left the country, in order to study dragons. Charlie met them again in [[1994]] and in [[1997]]. They also fought together at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] and survived the war; except for Fred, who was killed in an explosion. Although Charlie was not present when Fred was killed during the first half of the battle, it is very likely that Charlie was devastated by his death, like the other members of the family.\n\n====Harry Potter====\n{{Quote|You're tied in first place, Harry! You and Krum! Listen, I've got to run, I've got to go and send Mum an owl, I swore I'd tell her what happened \u2014 but that was unbelievable!|Charlie complimenting Harry on his First Task performance|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\n[[File:POA promo closeup Harry Potter 01.jpg|229x229px|thumb|left|[[Harry Potter]], his future brother-in-law]]\n\nHarry Potter first heard of Charlie in [[1991]], during his first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Harry heard many times that Charlie was a great Quidditch player and was very happy when he and his team lived up to Charlie's reputation. Eventually, Harry became an excellent player and Seeker for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], like Charlie.<ref name=\"PS10\"/> \n\nThey met each other in [[1994]], at the Burrow.<ref name=\"GOF5\"/> Harry seemed to like Charlie, who also helped him during his first task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]]; he showed the four dragons to [[Rubeus Hagrid]], [[Olympe Maxime]], and Harry (under the Invisibility Cloak).<ref name=\"GOF19\"/> Charlie also attended Harry's seventeenth birthday party, and, along with him, Bill and Fleur's wedding.<ref name=\"DH8\"/> They later fought together at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]; Charlie also witnessed Harry defeating [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], and they both survived the war.<ref name=\"DH36\"/> They became brothers-in-law when Harry married his youngest sibling Ginny Weasley and Charlie became the uncle of James Sirius, Albus Severus and Lily Luna Potter.\n\n====Nieces and nephews====\nAfter the [[Second Wizarding War]], Charlie had many nieces and nephews, through the [[Weasley family]]; Bill and Fleur's children: [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]], [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique,]] and [[Louis Weasley|Louis]]; Percy and Audrey's children: [[Molly Weasley II|Molly]] and [[Lucy Weasley|Lucy]]; George and Angelina's children: [[Fred Weasley II|Fred]] and [[Roxanne Weasley|Roxanne]]; Ron and Hermione's children: [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]]; and Ginny and Harry's children: [[James Potter II|James]], [[Albus Potter|Albus]], and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily]]. It is very likely that Charlie had a good relationship with all of them.\n\n===Rubeus Hagrid===\n{{Quote|How\u2019s yer brother Charlie? I liked him a lot \u2014 great with animals.|Hagrid asking Ron about this brother Charlie|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}\n[[File:Rubeus Hagrid.jpg|240x240px|thumb|[[Rubeus Hagrid]], his friend]]\nCharlie was a friend of Rubeus Hagrid. Rubeus Hagrid was the [[Keeper of Keys and Grounds|gamekeeper]] and later [[Care of Magical Creatures]] professor at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He described Charlie as being great with animals and stated that he had missed Charlie, during the time he studied dragons. They both liked magical creatures, and they met each other several times after Charlie left Hogwarts. Charlie invited Hagrid to watch some dragons he and his friends were breeding, during the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. \n\nIn [[1997]], Charlie stayed at [[the Burrow]]; both he and Hagrid attended [[Harry Potter's seventeenth birthday]] party and Bill and Fleur's wedding. Charlie, Hagrid, and another wizard sang along a song about [[Odo]] the hero. They also fought together at the final battle of the [[Second Wizarding War]] and survived the war.\n\n===Order of the Phoenix===\n[[File:Order of the Phoenix.png|250px|thumb|left|The original [[Order of the Phoenix]]]]\n\nCharlie became a member of the Order of the Phoenix during the [[Second Wizarding War]]. However, it is possible that he had not met all the members of the order, as he lived in [[Romania]], leading reinforcements for the order. It is possible that he knew some members, such as [[Remus Lupin]], [[Alastor Moody]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]], and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], as Lupin and Tonks attended Bill and Fleur's wedding with Charlie, and Charlie's father always spoke highly of Moody. Charlie had also been in the same year as Tonks at Hogwarts, and may have known her prior to joining the Order.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Charles\" comes from the Germanic name Karl, which was derived from a Germanic word which meant \"man\". However, an alternative theory states that it is derived from the common Germanic element hari meaning \"army, warrior\".\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:CharlieWeasleyHM.png|150px|thumb|Charles Weasley as he appears in {{HM}}]]\n[[File:Charlie Weasley LEGO.png|160px|thumb|Charlie Weasley as he appears in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]\n*Charlie is portrayed by [[Great Britain|British]] actor [[Alex Crockford]] in {{POA|FA}}. In the film, he appears only briefly, in a photograph of the Weasley family holidaying in Egypt. In the film, because he is only seen in the photograph, Charlie is the only member of the Weasley family who is not seen on-screen in person.\n[[File:Charlie_and_tonks.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Possible appearance with Tonks in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|Deathly Hallows: Part 1]]'']]\n*In {{DH|F1}}, a young man with red hair is seen standing beside [[Nymphadora Tonks]] at the wedding. It is likely that he is Charlie, due to his haircut (similar to the one described in the book), the fact that he is the same age as Tonks and also Tonks' alleged friendship with Charlie.\n*In {{PS}}, Gryffindors reminisce about his era as a distant golden age, since which the Gryffindor team has known years of frustration, yet from what [[J. K. Rowling]] tells us of his age, he would only have left [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] months before. However, in {{POA}}, [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] reveals that they had not been in the running for the Hogwarts [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]] for seven years. This means that Charlie would've been in his second or third year when they last won it. This may indicate a slight continuity error on J.K.'s part, perhaps indicating she originally envisioned Charlie as being older than he became. It is also possible that, like Harry, Charlie was an excellent Quidditch player, but still only won the Cup on one or two occasions due to other circumstances.\n*At Hogwarts, Charlie was in the same year as [[Nymphadora Tonks]].\n*In ''[[J.K. Rowling: A Year in the Life]]'', [[J. K. Rowling]] was asked if Charlie was [[Sexual orientation|gay]], to which she jokingly responded that he is not, just, \"He's more interested in dragons than women.\" This has prompted some to think he is an [[wikipedia:Affectional orientation|aromantic]] [[wikipedia:Asexuality|asexual]] but this has been neither confirmed nor denied by J.K. Rowling.\n*It is possible that in {{LEGO|Y1}}, the [[Dragon keeper]], found in the Year 4 level, [[Dragon]]s, is, in fact, Charlie.\n*Since the subplot of his job of recruiting foreign wizards for the Order of the Phoenix was scrapped from the films, it was never acknowledged if Charlie was a member of the Order of the Phoenix in the film continuity due to his frequent omissions from the film adaptions.\n*The [[narrator]]'s dialogue on the PC version of the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{PS}} implies that Charlie himself came to Hogwarts to collect Norbert rather than sending his associates. Despite this, at least two figures on [[broomstick]]s are seen flying around the [[Astronomy Tower]], and the scene is too shadowy to distinguish any features of the people in question.\n*Charlie only makes a major appearance in person in {{GOF}} during the beginning of the book.\n*In {{HM}}, [[Jacob's sibling]] describes his scent as grass and honeysuckle.\n*In {{HM}}, Charlie is depicted with brown eyes rather than the blue on his {{PM}} profile.\n*According to a drawing seen in {{HM}}, Charlie's favourite dragon is the [[Hebridean Black]].\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Charlie Weasley}}\n*{{PS}} {{1st Mention}}\n*{{PS|F}} {{Mention}}\n*{{PS|G}} {{Possible}}\n*{{COS}} {{Mention}}\n*{{COS|F}} {{Picture}}\n*{{POA}} {{Mention}}\n*{{POA|F}} {{Photograph}}\n*{{GOF}} {{1st}}\n*{{GOF|F}} {{Mention}}\n*{{OOTP}} {{Mention}}\n*{{HBP}} {{Mention}}\n*{{DH}}\n*{{DH|F1}} {{Possible}}\n*{{DH|G2}} {{Mention}}\n*{{CC}}\n*{{CC|P}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}} {{Possible}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}}\n*{{PM}} \n*{{WW}}\n*{{HM}}\n*[[Harry Potter: The Wand Collection]] {{Mention}}\n*{{WU}}\n*{{PAS}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=Unknown, eventually<br/>[[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]]\n|position=[[Prefect#Gryffindor|Male prefect of Gryffindor House]]<br/>(along with two other male Gryffindors in different years taking the post)\n|years=[[1988]]\u2013[[1991]]\n|successor=Unknown, eventually<br/>[[Percy Weasley]]\n}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=Unknown, eventually [[Angelica Cole]]\n|position=Captain of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]\n|years=?-[[1991]]\n|successor=[[Oliver Wood]]\n}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=Unknown\n|position=[[Seeker]] of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]\n|years=c.
