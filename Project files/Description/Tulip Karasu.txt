[[1973]]) was a [[wizardkind|witch]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1984]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw]]. She was eccentric, had a disregard for rules, and valued intelligence in others.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nWhen Tulip was young, she lived a very strict life due to her parent's employment in the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] in the [[British Ministry of Magic]]. This resulted in her growing a rebellious spirit, which she hid from her parents or anyone else.<ref name=\"y3ch7\"/>\n\nAt one point in her youth, she was admitted to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] after she came down with a case of [[dragon pox]].<ref name=\"y7ch18\">{{HM|7|18|hm}}</ref>\n\n===Hogwarts years {{C|1984-1991}}===\n====Early years====\nWhen she first attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, she met [[Merula Snyde]] and was attracted to her independence (with her parents in [[Azkaban]], Merula was free to do what she wanted), so she became friends with her.\n\nAs the [[Cursed Vaults]] became important in their first school year, they made their destiny to open the Vaults and show the world that they were as good as everyone else. Tulip and Merula soon stumbled upon [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]]'s [[Jacob's room|old research room]], but then started to gather information behind the others back, thus causing a falling out. They locked the room with two keys, one for each of them, so that neither could do any research nor could anyone else get in.<ref name=\"y3ch7\" />\n\n====Third year====\nIn her [[third year]], Tulip took [[Muggle Studies]] as one of her electives.<ref name=\"HM73\">{{HM|7|3}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[1986\u20131987 school year]], upon noticing Tulip's name on the lock outside Jacob's room, [[Jacob's sibling]], who was in the same year as Tulip, brought a friend to meet her in the [[Classroom 1B|Transfiguration Classroom]] for the first time, attempting to gain information from her. Tulip initially responded to being busy and asked them to meanwhile converse with her pet [[toad]], [[Dennis (toad)|Dennis]], who was strapped with a [[Dungbomb]] that had to be defused. Tulip admitted she was somewhat testing Jacob's sibling after the bomb was successfully defused. She told them there were two keys for the lock, one of which was possessed by [[Merula Snyde]]. They then proceeded to make plans on getting the Merula's key.<ref name=\"HM35\">{{HM|3|5}}</ref><ref name=\"HM36\">{{HM|3|6}}</ref>\n\nAround this time, Tulip also offered Dennis to Jacob's sibling for their companion when they were about to go to a [[Frog Choir]] audition. Tulip helped Jacob's sibling prepare for the audition.<ref name=\"HM3FC\">{{HM|3|The Frog Choir}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tulip Karasu Merula Boggart.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tulip facing a boggart in the shape of Merula Snyde in a Hogwarts cupboard, with Jacob's sibling]]\nAfter getting the key back, they both entered Jacob's room, only to find [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] there, therefore made a hasty retreat. Tulip correctly deduced that they had encountered a [[boggart]] after calming down, though the conversation was interrupted by Professor [[Severus Snape]], who told them to stay away from the corridor they were at, and to give up the search for the remaining vaults. They, however, continued the discussion after Professor Snape left, and concluded they needed to learn the [[Boggart-Banishing Spell]]. They went to the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]] to find a book on the spell, afterward, Tulip left with it to learn it first and then tracked down a supposedly less terrifying Boggart in the [[Artefact Room]] to teach Jacob's sibling and for practising purpose, before facing the one residing in Jacob's room.<ref name=\"y3ch7\"/>\n\nTulip was one of the four students that ventured into the [[Vault of Fear]] that year.<ref name=\"HM39\">{{HM|3|9}}</ref>\n\n====Fourth year====\n[[File:Tulip Karasu and Nymphadora Tonks.png|thumb|Karasu with her friend [[Nymphadora Tonks]]]]\nTulip was one of the first victims of Hogwarts' [[Sleepwalking curse|sleepwalking]] epidemic of that year, which was caused by the opening of a third [[Cursed Vaults|Cursed Vault]]. When she met with Jacob's sibling at the Courtyard, they cast ''[[Episkey]]'' to heal a sleepwalking-related headache she had. Tulip was then taken to the [[Hospital Wing]], where she talked about the incident with Jacob's sibling, with the two agreeing that the third vault was probably in the forest, despite being unsure about the reason sleepwalking students went there. Shortly after her recovery, Tulip unexpectedly met Madam [[Patricia Rakepick]] in a corridor and Rakepick asked her about the Cursed Vaults and the recent epidemic. Tulip later confessed to Jacob's sibling that she followed Rakepick after that encounter.<ref name=\"HM41\">{{HM|4|1}}</ref>\n\nFor the rest of the year, Tulip continued to gather with her friends to devise plans to find the next vault. With the group learning that a [[Broomstick|broom]] was the only (or better) way to get to the to [[Forbidden Forest]] and investigate the possible next vault, they discussed how to get one. After Jacob's sibling failed to borrow a broom from Madam [[Rolanda Hooch]], Tulip explained to them what the [[Black Lake incident]] was. The two later sneaked into [[Argus Filch]]'s office to try to steal a broom from there but were unable to find any usable brooms. They found, however, another transfigured black quill. They took it to Jacob's room and untransfigure it, revealing a message from [[R]] ordering Rakepick to leave the school, with a threat of punishment in case she disobeyed.<ref name=\"HM45\">{{HM|4|5}}</ref>\n\n====Fifth year====\nEarly in the [[1988\u20131989 school year]], Tulip pulled a prank releasing all the [[niffler]]s, which Jacob's sibling had to stop with the [[Freezing Charm]].<ref name=\"HM51\">{{HM|5|1}}</ref>\n\n====Sixth year====\nSometime during her [[sixth year]], Tulip became a founding member of the [[Circle of Khanna]], a group devoted to avenging [[Rowan Khanna]] and locating the final [[Cursed Vaults|Cursed Vault]]. It was at the groups first meeting in the [[Hog's Head Inn]] that she learned of the malevolent organisation \"[[R]]\" and its [[Plot to find the Cursed Vaults|motives]] to locate the final Cursed Vault before them.<ref name=\"HM620\">{{HM|6|20}}</ref>\n\n==Physical appearance==\n[[File:Tulip Karasu.jpeg|130px|thumb|Tulip's appearance]]\nTulip had brown eyes, fair skin, red hair, and black eyebrows. While donning school attire, she wore a [[necklace]] that resembled a [[Dungbomb]] and carried a booklet that had [[Zonko's Joke Shop]]'s Z logo as the cover in the pocket of her skirt.\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Tulip Karasu|I was quite jealous to be honest. I've always wanted to be told off in front of the entire school at a Welcoming Feast.|Jacob's sibling|Why?|Because rules are made to be broken, and Hogwarts has far too many rules.|Tulip's opinion on rules|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}\nWhen Jacob's sibling first met her in the [[Transfiguration]] classroom, it surprised Jacob's sibling that she was eccentric. As a [[Ravenclaw]], she was witty and had a knack for getting to the bottom of things.<ref name=\"y3ch8\" /> She showed interest in clever and quick-thinking people, such as [[Merula Snyde]]. Tulip was able to recognise and appreciate people for their intelligence alone, despite potentially having other problematic qualities.\n\nTulip was rebellious, believing that rules were made to be broken. She admitted enjoying chaos as an aesthetic.<ref name=\"y3ch7\" /> Those streaks led Tulip into performing some daring acts, such as sneaking a book of pranks out of the [[Restricted Section]], resulting in nearly blowing up the [[Owlery]], an incident she viewed as one of her finer moments.<ref name=\"y3ch8\">{{HM|3|8}}</ref>\n\nDuring her early years at Hogwarts, Tulip was left incredibly guilt-ridden over the fact that she selfishly betrayed her then best and only friend, Merula, in their shared pursuit of the Cursed Vaults. This soon developed intense feelings of inadequacy and self-loathing within her, with Tulip deeming herself unworthy of ever forming friendships with anyone (to the point that her boggart was Merula telling her that she will never have any friends), due to Tulip fearing that she will inevitably betray those she befriended. As a result, she chose to operate independently during her early years, keeping close to her pet toad Dennis and avoiding social encounters with Hogwarts students.\n\nThis all changed one day, however, when Jacob's sibling sought her out for help in their quest for the Cursed Vaults and began to befriend her, with the former reassuring Tulip that she indeed ''can'' change and have friends in her life. After spending some time with said student, Tulip gradually began to open up to them and ultimately came to their point of view regarding her adequacy for friendship when they told her that they considered her their friend. Their encouragement inspired and gave Tulip a more optimistic and hopeful outlook, since she enthusiastically agreed to help them out in their search for the vaults after accepting their offer of friendship.\n\nThis renewed hope in herself induced Tulip to turn away from her former independent and self-relying methods, accepting that she can have friends and indeed, she made numerous once accepting Jacob's sibling offer of friendship, with Tulip ultimately finding herself a best friend in fellow prankster and rule-breaker [[Nymphadora Tonks]]. Compared to her fellow pranksters though, Tulip tended to be cleaner and more methodological.\n\nShe was known to be a descent espionage, a skill she picked up from her parents who worked in the Ministry. She used her skills to scout [[Jacob's sibling]] as a replacement singer to pair with Dennis to try out for [[Frog Choir]], as Tulip was tone-deaf.\n\nTulip enjoyed swimming in the lake, which was considered very cold by most. She could also walk while carrying Tonks on her shoulders.<ref name=\"Quibbler\">{{HM|5|THE QUIBBLER: FIGHT FOR THE FRONT PAGE|4}}</ref> This indicated she was physically tougher than she appeared.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Tulip was skilled in Defence Against the Dark Arts, as she was to achieve an O.W.L. in the subject and study it further at N.E.W.T.-level, thus showing aptitude in the subject.\n*'''[[History of Magic]]''': Tulip was skilled in History of Magic, as she was able to achieve an O.W.L. in the subject and study it further at N.E.W.T.-level, thus showing aptitude in the subject.\n*'''[[Astronomy]]''': Tulip was skilled in Astronomy, as she was able to achieve an O.W.L. in the subject and study it further at N.E.W.T.-level, thus showing aptitude in the subject.\n*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Tulip was skilled in Transfiguration as she was able to achieve an O.W.L. in the [[Transfiguration (class)|subject]] and study it further at N.E.W.T.-level, thus showing aptitude in the subject.\n*'''[[Muggle Studies]]:''' Tulip earned an O.W.L. in Muggle Studies and continued the subject on N.E.W.T. level.<ref name=\"HM73\"/><ref name=\"HM74ms\">{{HM|7|4|ms}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nTulip, the flower of the same name, originated from [[Persia]] and [[Turkey]];<ref>[https://www.proflowers.com/blog/history-and-meaning-of-tulip History and Meaning of Tulips | Florapedia\u00ae]</ref> Tulip, as a name, is also of Turkish origin as a result of it.<ref>[https://appellationmountain.net/tulip-baby-name-of-the-day/ Tulip: Baby Name of the Day | Appellation Mountain]</ref><ref>[https://nameberry.com/babyname/Tulip Tulip | Nameberry.com]</ref> In Turkish, ''t\u00fclbent'' means turban \u2013 the shape some thought the flowers resembled.\n\nKarasu, as a surname, is relatively most common in Turkey.<ref>[http://forebears.io/surnames/karasu Karasu Surname Meaning & Statistics | Forebears]</ref><ref>[http://www.namespedia.com/details/Karasu Statistics and meaning of name Karasu | Names Encyclopedia]</ref> It means \"black water\" derived from Turkish ''kara'' meaning \"black, dark\" combined with ''su'' \"water\".<ref>[https://surnames.behindthename.com/name/karasu/submitted Karasu | Behind the Name]</ref>\n\nKarasu is also the romanization of the word for \"crow\" or \"raven\" in [[Japanese]], though not known to be a surname on its own.<!-- Please DO NOT add out-of-universe commentary on \"Harry Potter universe\"; it belongs to BTS and has been added upon insistence -->\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Tulip thinks fast, pranks rebelliously, and gets through Hogwarts by her wits.
