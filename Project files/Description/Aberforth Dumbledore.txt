Of course, I'm not entirely sure he can read, so that may not have been bravery...|Aberforth's unconventional personality|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\n'''Aberforth Dumbledore''' (b. [[1883]]/[[1884]]) was a [[half-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], the second son of [[Percival Dumbledore|Percival]] and [[Kendra Dumbledore]], younger brother of [[Albus Dumbledore|Albus]], and older brother of [[Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]]. He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] between [[1895]] and [[1902]]. His father \u2014 who had been sentenced to prison for attacking three [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] \u2014 died in [[Azkaban]] when Aberforth was young, and his mother and sister were later accidentally killed. Aberforth blamed his brother Albus for the [[death]] of their sister, Ariana and thus their relationship was rather strained.\n\nAberforth was the owner and barman of the [[Hog's Head Inn]] in [[Hogsmeade]], and was a member of the original [[Order of the Phoenix]] during the [[First Wizarding War]]. In [[1998]], he assisted [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] from a distance during their [[Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter's Horcrux Hunt|Horcrux hunt]], sending the [[House-elf]] [[Dobby]] to help them escape from [[Malfoy Manor]]. He later allowed them to use a secret tunnel that connected the Hog's Head to Hogwarts when the [[trio]] arrived in [[Hogsmeade]]. He subsequently fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] and survived the [[Second Wizarding War]]. He continued to live in Hogsmeade, tending to his [[goat]]s.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life {{c|1884-1891}}===\n{{Quote|They were not alike; Aberforth was never bookish and, unlike Albus, preferred to settle arguments by duelling rather than through reasoned discussion.

Their father cursed the boys in retaliation, and was arrested for it. He did not reveal to the authorities the reason for his attack, as Ariana would have been taken from the family as a threat to the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|Statute of Secrecy]] and placed in [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] permanently. Percival was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]], and Kendra moved the family to [[Godric's Hollow]], putting out a story that Ariana was ill and needed to remain at home.<ref name=\"DH C28\" /> This story led to the assumption that Ariana was a [[Squib]].<ref name=\"DH C8\" />\n\nAberforth attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] between [[1895]] and [[1902]].<ref name=\"Hogwarts\">Based on a birthdate of 1884, Aberforth would have attended Hogwarts between these dates, starting at age eleven and continuing for seven years.</ref> Unlike Albus, Aberforth preferred to solve his differences by duelling, rather than dialogue. He was in Albus's shadow, as his brother was an extraordinarily talented and academic [[Wizardkind|Wizard]] and even despite his great duelling talent, he was still incomparable to Albus in the field he specialised in.<ref name=\"DH C2\" />\n\n===Tragedy {{c|1891-1899}}===\n{{Quote|I could get her to eat when she wouldn't do it for my mother, I could calm her down, when she was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she used to help me feed the goats.|Aberforth and his relationship with his sister|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows }}[[File:Gellert Grindelwald and Albus Dumbledore.JPG|214x214px|thumb|Aberforth's brother Albus with his friend Gellert Grindelwald]]Aberforth was Ariana's favourite sibling, and he took part responsibility of taking care of her. However, he was not at home when Ariana lost control of her magic and accidentally killed their mother. Following his mother's passing, Aberforth wanted to leave school and take over the care of his sister, but Albus would not allow it. Albus wanted his younger brother to complete his education at Hogwarts, although he bitterly resented having to abandon his grand plans.<ref name=\"DH C28\" /> By this time, Aberforth was described as a \"wayward\" young man, known to chuck goat dung at their neighbours and inclined to get into [[Duelling|duels]] with those he had disagreements with.<ref name=\"DH C18\">{{DH|B|18}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Gellert Grindelwald]] came to [[Godric's Hollow]], he and Albus instantly struck up a friendship, together dreaming of finding the [[Deathly Hallows]] and leading a revolution that would make Muggles subservient to wizards. Upon learning of his elder brother's ambitions, Aberforth was disgusted by such a plan, but he was also concerned as Ariana would have to be involved. When it was time for Aberforth to return to Hogwarts, he decided to finally confront Albus and Grindelwald on the impossibility of such a scheme and angrily pointed out on Albus's neglect of Ariana and that he could not be the heroic leader of the revolution with Ariana in tow, which Albus later said to have \"brought him back to reality\" despite not wanting to hear the truth of the words Aberforth shouted at him.\n\nGrindelwald became furious and used the [[Cruciatus Curse]] on Aberforth. Albus tried to protect his brother and a three-way [[Duel at Godric's Hollow|duel]] broke out. While the three battled, Ariana tried to help her brother, but a stray curse from one of them hit Ariana, killing her.<ref name=\"DH C28\" /> Aberforth was devastated by the death of the younger sister he and his mother spent years caring for and furiously blamed Albus for Ariana's death, going as far as to [[Muggle duelling|physically assault]] his brother at their sister's funeral and actually breaking Albus's nose, shouting that Ariana's death was his fault.<ref name=\"DH C8\" /> He didn't forgive his brother and continued to resent him for years, despite Albus's immense feelings of regret, of which Aberforth did not know until Harry revealed it to him, which allowed Aberforth to finally forgive his brother.<ref name=\"DH C28\" />\n\n===Hog's Head Inn Barman {{c|Post 1899-?}}===\n[[File:Order of the Phoenix.png|251x251px|thumb|left|The original Order that Aberforth was a member of]]\n\nAt some point, Aberforth became the barman of the [[Hog's Head Inn]] in Hogsmeade village. When [[Tom Riddle]] returned to Hogwarts to apply for the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] post, Albus revealed that one of 'the local barmen', presumably Aberforth himself, told him about Riddle's followers awaiting him in the Hog's Head.<ref name=\"HBP C20\">{{HBP|B|20}}</ref> Later, when the [[First Wizarding War]] broke out, Aberforth joined the [[Order of the Phoenix]], opposing Lord Voldemort and his [[Death Eaters]].<ref name=\"OOTP C9\" />\n\n====First Wizarding War====\nSometime around [[1975]], [[Mundungus Fletcher]] was banned from Hog's Head for life.

[[Severus Snape]], then a Death Eater, overheard part of Trelawney's [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|prophecy]] about [[Harry Potter]] and Lord Voldemort. Snape was unable to hear its entirety, however, as Aberforth caught him eavesdropping and threw him out.<ref name=\"OOTP C37\">{{OOTP|B|37}}</ref><ref name=\"DH C33\">{{DH|B|33}}</ref>\n\n====Between the wars====\n[[File:Head aberforth.jpg|244x244px|thumb|Aberforth as the barman for the Hog's Head between the wars]]\nAround [[1982]], Aberforth was prosecuted by the [[Wizengamot]] for \"''using [[Aberforth Dumbledore's goat charm|inappropriate charms]] on a goat'',\" causing a \"minor scandal\", widely reported in the papers. According to his brother, Aberforth did not let the gossip get him down or force him into hiding; but Albus also jokingly claimed, as an alternative explanation, not to be completely sure Aberforth could read.<ref name=\"GOF C24\" />\n\nDuring the [[1988\u20131989 school year]], [[Jacob's sibling]] visited [[Hog's Head Inn]] to ask about [[Mundungus Fletcher]].

This was an illegal defence group, as [[Dolores Umbridge]] forbid all group activities. Aberforth served the large group [[Butterbeer]], even though some of the group considered ordering [[Firewhisky]].<ref name=\"OOTP 16\">{{OOTP|B|16}}</ref> [[Mundungus Fletcher]] was also present acting as an informant for the Order of the Phoenix.\n\nIn [[1996]], Aberforth met with Mundungus outside the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]], who appeared to be selling stolen goods from 12 Grimmauld Place to him; one of those items was [[Sirius Black]]'s [[two-way mirror]]. The exchange was observed by [[Harry Potter]], who attempted to confront Mundungus following Aberforth's departure.<ref name=\"HBP C12\">{{HBP|B|12}}</ref> \n[[File:B6C30M1 funeral of Albus Dumbledore.png|250x250px|thumb|The funeral of his older brother, Albus Dumbledore]]\nIn [[1997]], the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] took place at Hogwarts, culminating with the death of Albus Dumbledore at the hands of Severus Snape who (although this was unknown to everyone else at the time besides the deceased Dumbledore) was working under Albus's orders. A great number of people attended his funeral, including Aberforth, Hogwarts students, professors, old friends, Hogsmeade residents, Order of the Phoenix members and Ministry of Magic officials.<ref name=\"HBP C30\">{{HBP|B|30}}</ref> After his brother's death, Aberforth had no family left.\n\nThe [[1998|next year]], since Dumbledore had died and could not protect the school from Death Eaters, Lord Voldemort managed to take over Hogwarts. Snape became Headmaster, and [[Alecto Carrow|Alecto]] and [[Amycus Carrow]], two Death Eaters, became Deputy Headmaster and Deputy Headmistress. The Carrows enjoyed punishing students, and were cruel and sadistic. They used their power to torture the students who opposed them. Aberforth's pub was used as passageway into Hogwarts to the [[Room of Requirement]], he supplied the students in hiding with food and [[water]].<ref name=\"DH C28\" />\n\n[[File:Aberforth's reflection.png|251x251px|thumb|left|Aberforth looking out of the mirror fragment]]\n\nAberforth came into possession of one fragment of the two way mirror, using it to watch over Harry, just as his brother had done, through the other half. Harry was unaware of the details, but occasionally looked at the mirror, thinking the eyes might belong to Albus.<ref name=\"DH C28\"/> When Harry desperately requested help from the mirror whilst trapped at [[Malfoy Manor]], Aberforth sent [[Dobby]] to the rescue.<ref name=\"DH C23\"/> He was sad to learn the [[house-elf]] died in action.<ref name=\"DH C28\"/>\n\nDeciding to look for the next of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Horcrux]]es in the Death Eater-controlled [[Hogwarts Castle]], Harry, Hermione, and Ron Apparated into [[Hogsmeade]] village, setting off a [[Caterwauling Charm]] that alerted Death Eaters to their arrival. As they were hidden under the Invisibility Cloak, the Death Eaters decided to send [[Dementor]]s to find Harry. The Dementors, sensing fear, rapidly closed in, and Harry cast a [[Patronus Charm]] to repel them. A door creaked open behind, and Aberforth waved the trio in. Aberforth then convinced the Death Eaters that he set off the alarm by letting his [[cat]] out, and it was his goat Patronus, not Harry's [[Deer|stag]], that they actually saw.<ref name=\"DH C28\" />\n\nHarry recognised the man as Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus' younger brother. Aberforth wanted them to escape the village the next morning, believing the Order of the Phoenix finished, Voldemort had already won the war, and those still fighting were only deluding themselves. When Harry refused, saying he must complete Dumbledore's mission, Aberforth berated Harry for following his brother, and asked if he knew the entire truth about him. Harry, already doubting Dumbledore's intentions, was unable to respond. With little prodding, Aberforth indicated he knew [[Rita Skeeter]]'s [[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore|book]], and related the true story about their childhood and was shocked when Harry told him afterwards of Albus taking the [[Emerald Potion|Drink of Despair]], which revealed how much he still suffered great remorse for his past actions.<ref name=\"DH C28\" />\n\n[[File:Harry-potter7-movie-screencaps.com-3302.jpg|250x250px|thumb|The trio talking with Aberforth before the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]]]\n\nDespite hearing of Dumbledore's past, Harry intended to complete Dumbledore's mission, with or without Aberforth's help to get inside Hogwarts. While slowly forgiving his late brother after learning of Albus's remorse from Harry, Aberforth bowed to the inevitable and addressed Ariana's portrait, and she disappeared down a long, dark tunnel, soon returning with another figure; [[Neville Longbottom]]. Neville led the three back to the [[Room of Requirement]], and alerted the Order of the Phoenix that Harry had arrived at the school. The Hog's Head then became the main transportation hub for the outgoing students and the incoming Order members prior to the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] through a secret passageway behind a portrait of his sister Ariana.<ref name=\"DH C29\" /><ref name=\"DH C30\">{{DH|B|30}}</ref>\n[[File:The Battle of Hogwarts DHF2.jpg|250x250px|thumb|left|Aberforth fighting in the final battle along with the other defenders of Hogwarts]]\nAberforth fought in the battle; he entered Hogwarts to complain to Harry about how hundreds of evacuating students were thundering through his pub, and that they should have kept some [[Slytherin]] students as hostage against parenting Death Eaters, to which Harry countered that it would not stop Voldemort and that Albus would never do it. Although he had already forgiven his brother, Aberforth sneered at the latter theory before leaving to defend the castle.<ref name=\"DH C31\">{{DH|B|31}}</ref> During the battle, he offered encouragement to [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] when she fought some Death Eaters.

His eyes were of a brilliant, soul-piercing shade of blue, and usually hidden behind the dirty lenses of his spectacles. While they carried some noticeable brotherly resemblance, his more casual attire and often grumpy disposition made him appear considerably less conspicuous than Albus. He often wore an apron.<ref name=\"DH C28\"/>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Dialogue a-b|Ron Weasley|The silver doe. Was that you too?... Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!|Aberforth|Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven't I just proven my Patronus is a goat?|Aberforth mocking [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}Aberforth was regarded by most people who were familiar with him as being odd and gruff. [[Alastor Moody]], who met him at the taking of the photo of the original Order, only described him as a \"strange bloke\".<ref name=\"OOTP C9\" /> He had a curious obsession with [[goat]]s, which was seemed by some to be an inappropriate affection,<ref name=\"GOF C24\" /> and dealt with a great many dodgy customers at the [[Hog's Head Inn]].<ref name=\"OOTP C9\" /> He also had a long memory; he once placed a lifetime ban from the Hog's Head on [[Mundungus Fletcher]] for offending him.<ref name=\"OOTP C17\" /> Aberforth had a sharp wit and was a highly talented [[Duelling|duellist]], though he had no interest in academic matters. It is suggested that Aberforth was illiterate, hence why he did not let the scandal of him practising inappropriate [[charm]]s on a goat upset him. Despite not being as intelligent as his brother, he seemed to know what Horcruxes were when told about the hunt, suggesting a greater intelligence than he let on. He was a very terse person, commenting that the [[trio]] were being \"''Bloody Fools''\".<ref name=\"DH C28\" /><ref name=\"DH C31\" />\n\nAberforth generally seemed cynical and bad-tempered, such as when he sarcastically pointed out to [[Harry Potter]] how little [[Albus Dumbledore]] had really told him even while putting an enormous responsibility on his shoulders. However, despite this, Aberforth proved himself worthy of being a [[Gryffindor]], displaying an astonishing amount of bravery and remarkable amount of morality that held firm even when it came to his family despite his cynical and rough personality, with Albus describing Aberforth as ultimately an ''infinitely better'' man than he ever was. For example, although it was [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] who traumatised his sister, Aberforth never discriminated against them and found the thought of Albus and Grindelwald's quest for Muggle domination as being absolutely disgusting, not only because of the danger Ariana and himself would be under but also because of the overall amount of damage that would be caused by such quest, even going as far as to not hesitate to duel both of them at once, despite knowing fully well they were superior duelists who he would certainly not stand a chance against, with his magic seemingly being amplified by the anger and determination he felt to hold them at bay, a feat made even more impressive by the fact that he previously had been subjected to the [[Cruciatus Curse]] by Grindelwald. \n\nIn addition, Aberforth would join the [[Order of the Phoenix]] despite it being led by the older brother who he so disliked for his glory-seeking, and blaming him for their younger sister's tragic [[death]], indicating he was willing to overcome his grudge towards his brother to fight for the whole wizarding world, further showing his morality. Although he never forgave Albus for years, Aberforth still considered Albus his brother and maintained contact with him, with their relationship being deemed cordial by [[Elphias Doge]], and Aberforth joined the [[Order of the Phoenix]], which Albus founded and led, and attended Albus's funeral. Also, in spite of claiming earlier that \"''You-Know-Who's won, it's over, and anyone who's pretending different's kidding themselves''\" and also showing still his resentment of Albus's true nature, Aberforth was shocked into silence as he contemplated what Harry had revealed: that Albus had never forgiven himself for Ariana's death and was always tortured by the fact that he was responsible for it. Ultimately forgiving his brother, Aberforth then fought bravely and selflessly at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], which may be out of a desire to honour his older brother's memory by protecting the school Albus had led for so long, possibly sparked by the regret of never even considering Albus had regretted Ariana's death and also that he never managed to reconcile with his brother. In addition, he appeared to consider the possibility that his brother would never resort to having Slytherin students held as ransom against the Death Eaters before sneering at the idea. His unwillingly courageous nature shows itself in one of his last conversations with Harry; after Harry thanked him for saving his and his friends' lives twice, Aberforth gruffly retorted, \"''Look after 'em, then. I might not be able to save 'em a third time''\".<ref name=\"DH C28\" />\n\nAberforth was rather willing to use underhanded tactics against his foes, as he suggested to Harry to hold [[Slytherin]] students hostage against their parents who also served as [[Death Eaters]].<ref name=\"DH C31\"/>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n[[File:Aberforth Dumbledore Goat Patronus.png|220px|thumb|right|Aberforth's [[goat]] [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]]]]\nThough he did not have his brother Albus' prestigious gifts, Aberforth was nonetheless a very talented and powerful [[Wizardkind|wizard]] in his own right, given his participation in and subsequent survival of the [[First Wizarding War|First]] and [[Second Wizarding War]]s, the latter of which included the legendary [[Battle of Hogwarts]].\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Aberforth Dumbledore once used a [[Aberforth Dumbledore's goat charm|charm to keep a goat clean and its horns curly]]. Though he was prosecuted because that charm was considered inappropriate, it was still a testament of sorts to his being skilled in charms.<ref name=\"GOF C24\"/> Aberforth was also able to conjure a corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], which is incredibly advanced and powerful [[magic]] as well as proof of superior magical ability. His Patronus took the corporeal form of a [[goat]].<ref name=\"DH C28\" />\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': During his school years, Aberforth was said to prefer to settle things by duelling instead of negotiating,<ref name=\"DH C2\" /> which shows that, even as a student, he was already an active and experienced duelist, although [[Albus Dumbledore|his brother]] was still superior to him, noted to have the ability to put Aberforth in his place had he wanted to. Despite this, by the age of fifteen, his duelling skills were already sufficient to stand his ground in the three-way duel between himself, Albus, and [[Gellert Grindelwald]] when they were teenagers, both of whom eventually became arguably the most powerful duellists to ever live.<ref name=\"DH C28\" /> Aberforth also noted the reason he did not face [[Patricia Rakepick]], an infamously powerful individual, in battle when she came to his pub was not because he was afraid of facing her but because she would have disappeared without any traces for him to inform the Auror Office about, showing he was assured of his ability to at least fight against the dark witch long enough for reinforcements to come. During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] he fought courageously and defeated the very skilled Death Eater [[Augustus Rookwood]]<ref name=\"DH C31\" /> and emerged as one of the survivors,<ref name=\"DHF2\"/><ref name=\"accio\"/> showing him to have been remarkably proficient in [[martial magic]] to have survived such a bloody battle.\n*'''[[Legilimency]] (possibly)''': Harry once described him as having the same piercing look as his brother.<ref name=\"DH C28\"/> Given that Albus usually had this look when performing Legilimency, it's possible that Aberforth did the same.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Parents===\n\n[[File:Percival Dumbledore.png|241x241px|thumb|left|[[Percival Dumbledore]], his father]]\n\nAberforth's relationship with his parents is not very well known. His [[Percival Dumbledore|father]] was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] after he used illegal spells on three Muggle boys who attacked Ariana. Because of this, it's likely that, like Albus, Aberforth did not hold Percival in high regard. His [[Kendra Dumbledore|mother]] was described as a good woman, but Aberforth knew her secretive nature and bitterly described himself and Albus as having learned lies and secrets from her. Nevertheless, when Kendra was accidentally killed by Ariana, Aberforth's bitterness did not prevent him from being devastated by her death, judging from the grief and sadness with which he described the event.<ref name=\"DH C28\" />\n[[File:Kendra Dumbledore.png|241x241px|thumb|right|[[Kendra Dumbledore]], his mother]]\n\n===Ariana Dumbledore===\n{{Quote|I was her favourite... She liked me best.|Aberforth regarding his little sister|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}[[File:ArianaDumbledorePortrait.jpg|216x216px|thumb|Aberforth's portrait of Ariana]]\n\nAberforth Dumbledore was [[Ariana Dumbledore]]'s older brother. She seemed to have preferred him rather than their eldest brother, Albus Dumbledore. After her attack, Aberforth was the only one who could calm her down when she flew into a rage, something even their [[Kendra Dumbledore|mother]] could not always accomplish. The two often fed goats together in their free time. Aberforth was not present when Ariana lost control of her [[magic]] and accidentally killed their mother. He believed that he would have been able to prevent the death of his mother. After the unfortunate incident, he wanted to take care of Ariana, but their older brother [[Albus Dumbledore|Albus]] insisted that Aberforth complete his education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] first.\n\nSoon after, Albus became friends with [[Gellert Grindelwald]], and Aberforth stepped in when they began making plans for world domination and [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] subjugation, pointing out that Ariana was in no state to be dragged along with them. This resulted in a three-way [[Duel at Godric's Hollow|duel]] between Ariana's brothers and Grindelwald. Ariana tried to interfere, and was inadvertently killed by one of them, which devastated Aberforth and caused an unending rift between him and Albus. It is unknown who actually cast the spell which led to her death. At Ariana's funeral, Aberforth broke his brother's nose and shouted at him that her death was all his fault. Long after Ariana's death, Aberforth continued to keep a [[portrait]] of his late sister in the [[Hog's Head Inn]], symbolising his affection for her.

After the death of [[Kendra Dumbledore]], Albus was left to care for his brother and sister and the two remained as strained as ever, as while Albus insisted that Aberforth complete his education, Aberforth disliked the way Albus was treating Ariana. When Albus and his friend, Gellert Grindelwald, began planning to start a revolution, Aberforth and Albus grew even more estranged as Aberforth was disgusted by his older brother's ambitions and this soon escalates to the point that Aberforth angrily confronted Albus and bluntly told him that Ariana would not be accompanying and his plans are impossible, resulting in Grindelwald initiating a duel that resulted in Ariana's death, which finally caused Albus and Aberforth to become fully estranged, as Aberforth felt extreme amount of anger at Albus and he fully blamed him for Ariana's death,<ref name=\"DH C28\" /> shouting at him at Ariana's funeral and breaking his nose.<ref name=\"DH C8\" /> <span>In his later years, </span><span>Albus became the longest and most noted </span>[[Headmaster]]<span> of </span>[[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]<span> and was considered to be the greatest wizard of all time. During</span> this time, the two had relatively little contact, although Aberforth and Albus had managed to establish a cordial relationship according to Elphias Doge and Aberforth did join the original [[Order of the Phoenix]] during the [[First Wizarding War]],<ref name=\"OOTP C9\" /> as well as attending his brother's [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|funeral]] in 1997.<ref name=\"HBP C30\" />\n\nAlthough Albus initially was resentful towards Aberforth for dragging him down from fame and glory with the responsibility of being head of the family, Albus loved his brother dearly, and came to respect and admire him greatly for his devotion to Ariana.<ref name=\"DH C28\" /> However, despite Albus being known to feel sadness for his estrangement with his younger brother, he never attempted to change Aberforth's opinions of him, likely as he recognised that he fully deserved Aberforth's resentment and accepted it as punishment for his part in the tragic death of Ariana. But he did have a desire to reconcile with Aberforth, as whenever he looked at the Mirror of Erised, he would see Aberforth reconciled with him. While he still bitterly resented Albus even after the death of his older brother, Aberforth eventually forgave his late brother after Harry explained Albus' drinking of the [[Emerald Potion|Drink of Despair]], and fought in the defence of his brother's school, the first of the Hogsmeade residents to do so.\n\n===Gellert Grindelwald===\n[[File:GellertGrindelwaldHarryPotterPagetoScreen.JPG|217x217px|thumb|[[Gellert Grindelwald]]]]\n\nAberforth detested Gellert Grindelwald immensely. Grindelwald was Albus's friend after [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. While Aberforth was taking care of Ariana, Albus and Grindelwald were planning to enslave the [[Non-magic people|Muggles]]. As the two boys were planning to travel around the world, they also planned to take Ariana with them. Aberforth opposed them, telling them that they were being irresponsible and that he would be able to take care of Ariana once more. Grindelwald became very angry and used the [[Cruciatus Curse]] on Aberforth; Albus then defended his brother and the three boys began to duel. None of the three ever knew who had cast the fatal spell, but by the end of the duel, Ariana lay dead on the floor. Grindelwald immediately fled the country; the two brothers both lived the rest of their lives with the fear that ''they'' had cast the curse that killed their sister. Aberforth retained bitter feelings towards Grindelwald for many years after their fateful encounter, and when he recounted the events that led to his sister's death Harry noted the \"positively dangerous\" look that came over his face when Grindelwald's name was mentioned.<ref name=\"DH C28\" />\n\n===Harry Potter===\n{{Quote|That's a boy's answer.

Aberforth narrated to Harry the story of his early life. Harry pitied him, and was almost devastated when he heard it all, although he then revealed the remorse which his brother Albus suffered over his past actions, prompting Aberforth to finally forgive his late brother. Harry also argued with Aberforth when he told Harry to leave Hogsmeade, in order to save his own skin. However, they later both fought at the Battle of Hogwarts and survived the war. It is conceivable that they remained in contact afterwards.<ref name=\"DH C28\" />\n\n===Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger===\n[[File:The-trio-Harry-Potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets-potterhead-29266030-365-400.jpg|243x243px|thumb|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]]]]\nAberforth met [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] in [[1998]], before the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. As Ron and Hermione were Harry's friends, they visited [[Hogsmeade]] in order to get into [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Aberforth helped them, while telling them the story of his family life. Ron and Hermione were both shocked and highly sympathetic to his plight. They later fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] with Aberforth and they all survived the war. It is possible that they remained in contact later on.<ref name=\"DH C28\" />\n\n===Dobby===\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Aberforth Dumbledore|Thought he'd be with you.

As Aberforth was an old and grumpy person, he did not have a good relationship with many people. However, Aberforth himself stated that he liked Dobby and was sad about his death.\n\nIn [[1998]], [[Harry Potter]] and his friends were captured by [[Snatchers]] and imprisoned at the [[Malfoy Manor]] cellar. Harry asked for help while looking at a two-way mirror; Aberforth had the other mirror. He sent Dobby to rescue them; the house-elf did so, but was killed by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]].<ref name=\"DH C28\" />\n\n===Order of the Phoenix members===\n[[File:Order of the Phoenix.png|250x250px|thumb|The original [[Order of the Phoenix]]]]\nAlthough he had a good relationship with some members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], Aberforth was described as a \"strange bloke\" by [[Alastor Moody]].<ref name=\"OOTP C9\" /> He also fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]]. Aberforth seemed to know [[Remus Lupin]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]] and [[Fred and George Weasley]]. He saw Lupin fighting with [[Antonin Dolohov]] and he told Tonks so. He met many allies of the Order during the Battle of Hogwarts, when many people were getting into [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] through a portrait-hole in a room of his pub.<ref name=\"DH C31\" />\n\nAberforth had a mixed relationship with [[Mundungus Fletcher]]. While Aberforth banned Mundungus for life from the bar for offending him,<ref name=\"OOTP C17\" /> the two remained in touch, with Mundungus selling stolen goods to Aberforth.<ref name=\"HBP C12\" />\n\nHe did not seem to have a very high opinion of [[Elphias Doge]] for his hero worshipping Albus both as students and later in life.\n\n==Etymology==\nIn Welsh, ''Aberforth'' means \"from the river\".<ref>[http://www.mugglenet.com/books/name_origins.shtml MuggleNet: Name Origins]</ref> Also, in Old English, ''Aber'' means \"the river mouth\", and would look like \u00c6bber when written in Old English.\n\nDumbledore is Old English for \"bumblebee\". When breaking down the etymology of Dumbledore, ''dora'' is the Old English word for humble-bee, which became ''dore ''or ''dorre ''in Middle English.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:LEGO Aberforth.png|thumb|Aberforth Dumbledore in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]\n*Aberforth appears briefly in {{OOTP|FA}} played by [[Jim McManus]], and is portrayed by [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] in {{DH|F2}}.\n*Though in the books his Patronus is a goat, in {{DH|F2}}, he produces a non-corporeal Patronus while fending off hundreds of [[Dementor]]s.\n*The character first appeared as the innkeeper at the Hog's Head in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', though he was not revealed to be Aberforth in the books until the final instalment. Many fans, however, made the connection through the hints provided. When asked about the various hints, [[Harry Potter (book series)|''Harry Potter'' series]] author [[J. K. Rowling]] at first coyly stated \"I was quite proud of that clue,\" but then admitted \"Well yes, obviously.\"<ref name=\"edinburhg\">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0804-ebf.htm Edinburgh Book Festival Interview]</ref>\n*In a 2005 interview, when asked who her favourite member of the Order of the Phoenix was, J. K. Rowling stated that \"...there is one member of the Order of the Phoenix that you have not yet met properly and you will, well, you know that they are a member, but you haven't really met them properly yet and you will meet them in [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|seven]], so I am looking forward to that.\" It is likely that Rowling was referring to Aberforth, as readers had \"met\" him as the owner of the Hog's Head, but at the time did not yet know him for who he was.<ref name=\"cubreporter\">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-edinburgh-ITVcubreporters.htm Edinburgh \"cub reporter\" Press Conference, available via Accio Quote!]</ref>\n*In response to Twitter user [https://twitter.com/WeWillQuackYou Tasha Florentz-Clift]'s comment \"[https://twitter.com/WeWillQuackYou/status/616133852428374016 \"It does not do to dwell on goats and forget to live.\" J.K. @jk_rowling #AddGoatRuinAQuote]\", J.K.
