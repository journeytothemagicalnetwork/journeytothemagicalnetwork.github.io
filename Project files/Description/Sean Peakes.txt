At Hogwarts later that year, a group of [[Slytherin]]s tried to steal the game from him, so he hid from them in the [[Clock Tower]]. [[Harry Potter]], who was looking for a Reusable Hangman for [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], found him there, and he agreed to give the game to Harry in exchange for three [[Stink Pellets]]. He planned to use these Stink Pellets in order to drive off the Slytherins if they gave him trouble again.<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>\n\nHe may have been related to [[Glanmore Peakes]] or to [[Jimmy Peakes]], who attended Hogwarts around the same time, but was in [[Gryffindor]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{1st}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Peakes, Sean}}\n[[pl:Sean Peakes]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Hufflepuffs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Peakes family]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
