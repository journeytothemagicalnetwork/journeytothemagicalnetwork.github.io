It was introduced to England by the Normans in the forms Roese or Rohese. From an early date it was associated with the word for the fragrant flower rose (derived from Latin rosa). When the name was revived in the 19th century, it was probably with the flower in mind.\n\nThe name Rose Zeller is pronounced similarly to \"rosella\", one of six species of native Australian parrot.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{OOTP}} {{1st}}\n*{{OOTP|F}} {{Possible}}<ref>The French wikipedia names another cast named [[Jena Wilhelmson]], playing Rose Zeller, in this film adaption.
