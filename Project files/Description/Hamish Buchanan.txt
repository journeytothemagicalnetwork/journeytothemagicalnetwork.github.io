He was the son of [[Angus Buchanan's father|Mr]] and [[Angus Buchanan's mother|Mrs Buchanan]] and the older brother of [[Angus Buchanan]].<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\n==Biography==\nHamish was born into the [[wizardkind|wizarding]] [[Buchanan family]] sometime during the mid-[[19th century]] and grew up in a village in the [[Scottish Borders]]. He was his parents' first- or second-born son, and had a total of ten siblings, including his sister [[Flora Buchanan|Flora]] and his younger brother [[Angus Buchanan|Angus]]. All of the Buchanan children had a reputation for being of above-average size and behaving wildly.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\nWhen Hamish turned eleven, he received a [[Hogwarts acceptance letter]], and began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. The local [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] villagers, not knowing that the Buchanan family were [[magic]]al, assumed that he had been sent to a corrective facility or mental institution. It is unknown what [[Hogwarts Houses|house]] Hamish was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into at Hogwarts.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" />\n\nHamish and his other siblings were especially fond of their brother Angus. Since [[Angus Buchanan's father|their father]] was highly prejudiced against [[Squib]]s, Hamish and his siblings covered for Angus when, unlike them, he displayed no signs of magical ability. On [[1 September]], [[1858]], the day that eleven-year-old Angus was due to begin his [[first year]] at Hogwarts, Hamish flew him to [[Hogwarts Castle]] on the back of [[Hamish Buchanan's broomstick|his broomstick]], desperately hoping that the faculty would allow him to stay once he arrived, or that the school might be able to coax some magic out of him.<ref name=\"Pottermore\">{{WW|scottish-rugby}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{PM}} {{1st Mention}}\n*{{WW}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Buchanan, Hamish}}\n\n[[de:Hamish Buchanan]]\n[[pl:Hamish Buchanan]]\n[[pt-br:Hamish Buchanan]]\n[[ru:\u0425\u044d\u043c\u0438\u0448 \u0411\u044c\u044e\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d]]\n[[Category:19th century births]]\n[[Category:Buchanan family|Hamish]]\n[[Category:Historical figures]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Scottish individuals]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
