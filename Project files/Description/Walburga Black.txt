As revealed in ''[[Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies]]'', Chapter 3 (Horace Slughorn), Slughorn had \"completed half a century of service\" at the time of his retirement in [[1981]], meaning he started teaching there circa [[1931]].

She kept herself alive out of pure spite.|Walburga's unpleasant personality|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n\n'''Walburga Black''' ([[1925]] \u2013 [[1985]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[pure-blood]] [[Dark Wizard|Dark witch]], the eldest daughter of [[Pollux Black]] and [[Irma Crabbe]], the sister of [[Alphard Black|Alphard]] and [[Cygnus Black III|Cygnus]], the wife and second cousin of [[Orion Black]], and the mother of [[Sirius Black]] III and [[Regulus Black]] II. She was also a member of the noble [[House of Black]], an old wizarding family and one of the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]].\n\nWalburga lived in [[Grimmauld Place]] starting at an unknown point in her life, presumably after she married her second cousin Orion. She died in [[1985]], but [[Walburga Black's portrait|her portrait]] still remains at [[12 Grimmauld Place]]. Walburga's portrait makes anyone not in the [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood elite]] quite uncomfortable in her home, by constantly shouting insults and epithets at them.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|Were \u2014 were your parents [[Death Eaters]] as well?|Sirius Black|No, no, but believe me, they thought [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] had the right idea, they were all for the purification of the wizarding race, getting rid of [[Muggle-born]]s and having [[pure-blood]]s in charge\u2026 I bet my parents thought Regulus was a right little hero for joining up at first.|[[Sirius Black]] regarding his family's views|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n\nWalburga was a member of the traditionalist [[pure-blood]] [[House of Black]], who looked down on any except other \"respectable\" pure-blood wizards and believed in [[pure-blood supremacy]]. She was the daughter of [[Pollux Black]] and [[Irma Crabbe]], and sister of [[Alphard Black|Alphard]] and [[Cygnus Black III|Cygnus]]. In her youth, she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] where she was sorted into [[Slytherin]]. Shortly after graduating Hogwarts, Walburga waited for her second cousin [[Orion Black|Orion]] to finish his education and married him at some point in the [[1950s]].<ref name=\"OOTP6\"/>\n===Family life and death===\n[[File:The Blacks - Pottermore.png|214x214px|thumb|left|The Blacks in the early [[1970s]]. From left to right: [[Orion Black|Orion]], [[Regulus Black|Regulus]], Walburga, and [[Sirius Black|Sirius]]]]\n\nWalburga gave birth to a son, [[Sirius Black|Sirius]], on [[3 November]], [[1959]]. However, Sirius was a severe disappointment to her because he did not agree with the ideology of [[Blood status|blood purity]] and was sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], rather than the family's traditional house, [[Slytherin]].<ref name=\"slytherin\" /> Growing up, he ticked off his parents (particularly his mother) by decorating his room with posters from the muggle world depicting bikini-clad women and motorcycles, and had stuck those to the walls with irreversible sticking charms that infuriated her.\n\nSirius was disinherited and removed from the [[House of Black|Black Family tree]] when he left home at the age of sixteen to live with the [[Potter family]]. Walburga personally blasted her son from the tapestry. She maintained a habit of blasting people from the [[House of Black|Black family tree]] which stood in the hall of the family home at [[12 Grimmauld Place]] if they displeased her; she did so to her brother [[Alphard Black|Alphard]] simply because he left gold to Sirius despite being disowned. According to [[Kreacher]], Walburga was heartbroken by this abandonment, but nonetheless disowned both of them to cleanse the tapestry.\n\nLuckily for her, Walburga gave birth to another son, [[Regulus Black|Regulus]], around [[1962|1961]]. He followed the family traditions and joined the Slytherin House, and eventually became his mother's favourite, as well as heir to the wealth, position, and traditions of the Black family. Regulus became a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] during the [[First Wizarding War]]; although neither Walburga nor Orion were followers of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] themselves, according to Sirius, they thought he \"''had the right idea''\"<ref name=\"OOTP6\">{{OOTP|B|6}}</ref>, until they saw that Voldemort was ruthless in his pursuit for power, at which point they got cold feet. Regulus was killed in [[1979]] after trying to destroy Voldemort's [[Horcrux]], and died childless without an heir. As Regulus forbade Kreacher from telling this to anyone, Walburga thought Regulus died trying to leave the organisation.<ref name=\"DH10\">{{DH|B|10}}</ref> Walburga's husband [[Orion Black|Orion]] also died in the same year from an unknown cause. Walburga was obviously devastated when her husband and son died.\n\nIn [[1981]], Walburga's disowned son, Sirius was framed for the murder of his friend, [[Peter Pettigrew]] and [[Peter Pettigrew's unidentified victims|12 Muggles]] and was thus sent to [[Azkaban]].<ref name=\"POA10\">{{POA|B|10}}</ref> It is possible that if Walburga heard of this, she would have been pleased.\n\nShe died in 1985, leaving her house-elf [[Kreacher]] in [[12 Grimmauld Place|her now abandoned house]].<ref name=\"BFT\" />\n\n===Post-mortem===\n{{Main|Portrait of Walburga Black at 12 Grimmauld Place}}\n\n{{Dialogue|Walburga Black|Freaks.|Kreacher|There, there, mistress.|Portrait of Walburga on the people staying in her house|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)}}\n\n[[Portrait of Walburga Black at 12 Grimmauld Place|Walburga's portrait]] remained magically fixed to the wall in the hallway of her family home, using a [[Permanent Sticking Charm]].<ref name=\"OOTP5\">{{OOTP|B|5}}</ref> The picture, which was covered in canvas when inactive, showed an insane old woman, prone to screaming insults at anyone who disturbed the portrait, particularly that of non-pure-bloods. This happened several times when the [[Order of the Phoenix]] used Grimmauld Place as their headquarters after her death, and they tried unsuccessfully to remove the portrait for quite sometime. \n\nWalburga survived the deaths of her family, but the destruction of it may account for her final madness. After their deaths, she was alone in the house except for the family [[house-elf]], [[Kreacher]], who seemed equally deranged due to his parroting her beliefs, up until [[Harry Potter]] came to know and treat him better one year after inheriting him.<ref name=\"OTP\">{{OOTP}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Stains of dishonour, filthy half-breeds, blood traitors, children of filth!|[[Walburga Black's portrait|Portrait of Walburga Black]] screaming at members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n\nWalburga Black, like most members of her family, was obsessed with blood purity, and [[Walburga Black's portrait|her portrait]] would often scream insults at blood traitors, [[half-blood]]s or [[muggle-born]] wizards. She had little affection for her son [[Sirius Black|Sirius]], as he was viewed as a [[blood traitor]] by the [[House of Black|Black family]] but appeared to have a fairly good relationship with Sirius' younger brother, [[Regulus Black|Regulus]], and was proud of him when he joined the [[Death Eaters]]. Although she was not a Death Eater herself, she was convinced that [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] was doing the right thing by trying to eliminate [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s and bringing [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] out of hiding for them to rule both the [[Wizarding world|Wizarding]] and [[Muggle world|Muggle]] worlds. Despite this she is known to have become disillusioned with the Death Eaters toward the end of the [[First Wizarding War]], showing that even she believed that they were going too far.  \n\nWalburga was kind to her house elf, [[Kreacher]], who shared her views on blood purity, and as such Kreacher was very loyal to her. Based on her portrait's tendencies of screaming uncontrollably, she seems to have had a very violent temper, similar to her elder son when angered. Sirius justified this by claiming that his mother was an intensely spiteful and heartless woman, though Kreacher did say Walburga was heartbroken by Sirius' defection.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Whilst the true extent of her skill in this field is unknown Walburga Black was proficient enough to have placed a [[Permanent Sticking Charm]] on the back of [[Walburga Black's portrait|her portrait]] to prevent anyone from taking it off the wall.\ufeff The charm held in place for more than a decade after her death.<ref name=\"OOTP5\"/> She could not, however, cast the [[Patronus Charm]].<ref name=\"LHP5-7\">{{LEGO|Y2}}</ref>\n*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Walburga was proficient in dark magic, being able to cast both the [[Killing Curse]] and the [[Imperius Curse]] successfully and was also skilled in the handling [[curse]]d objects.<ref name=\"LHP5-7\" />  \n\n==Relationships==\n===Black family===\nWalburga and Orion had a happy marriage and relationship, especially since they shared blood purity ideology. Walburga was likely devastated when her husband died. Walburga's eldest son, Sirius was a huge disappointment to her and the rest of the family, since he disagreed with the Black family's beliefs in blood purity and was sorted into [[Gryffindor]] rather than [[Slytherin]]. When Sirius left home at the age of 16, she blasted his name off the tapestry. If she had heard about his being sent to Azkaban, she was likely pleased. Though she hated him, Kreacher did state Walburga was heartbroken by Sirius' departure.\n\nWalburga greatly admired and favoured her younger son, Regulus because he remained loyal to the Black family traditions and was sorted into Slytherin. Walburga was obviously devastated when her son died.This event may have finally made her to begin doubting the cause of the [[Death Eaters]] and begin to think that they were taking things to far due to the death of her favoured son.\n\n==Etymology==\n*Walburga is a variation of the name ''Walpurga'', who was a saint for whom {{wplink|Walpurgis Night}} is named. Historically, Walpurgis Night was considered to be a time when the barrier between the living and the dead was weak and when witches held celebrations. Also, the Knights of Walpurgis (later known as the [[Death Eaters]]) were named after Walpurgis Night.\n*Walburga was also the given name of the mother of {{wplink|Josef Mengele}}, a Nazi doctor who conducted horrific experiments on prisoners in concentration camps. She was said to have been extremely cruel and a Nazi supporter, rather like Walburga Black's views on retaining blood purity.\n*{{wplink|256 Walpurga}} is a large Main belt asteroid. It was discovered by {{wplink|Johann Palisa}} on April 3, 1886 in {{wplink|Vienna}} and was named after {{wplink|Saint Walpurga}}. This loosely fits in with the Black family tradition of using celestial names for their children.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Walburga Black's likeness on the [[Black Family Tapestry]], as featured in {{OOTP|FA}}, seems to have been based on [http://media.vam.ac.uk/media/thira/collection_images/2006BF/2006BF7035_jpg_l.jpg a depiction of a noblewoman] from the [[Wikipedia:Devonshire Hunting Tapestries|Devonshire Hunting Tapestries]], currently in the collection of the [[Wikipedia:Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria and Albert Museum]], in [[London]].\n*In {{OOTP|FA}}, [[Portrait of Walburga Black at 12 Grimmauld Place|Walburga's portrait]] was not heard screaming, but she could be heard muttering behind her curtain, and [[Kreacher]] still talked about the \"scum\" in [[12 Grimmauld Place]], such as \"[[Mudblood]]s\" and \"[[Blood traitor]]s\".\n*Walburga's father was only thirteen when Walburga was born, although it is possible this is a mathematical error on Rowling's part (Rowling has admitted she lacks skills with mathematics).\n*On the tapestry from the film, Walburga and [[Orion Black|Orion]] are depicted together, and their heads looking in different ways, although they are in marriage. This is likely because both Walburga and [[Orion Black|Orion]] were born into the House of Black, and their marriage may have been arranged.\n*Walburga was probably educated at Hogwarts as [[Horace Slughorn]] mentions that he has taught the whole Black Family.\n*Since Walburga and [[Lucretia Black]] were born in the same year, it is more likely that they were classmates at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].\n*Walburga may have known [[Tom Riddle]], as he was one or two years behind her, so she could have encountered him at Hogwarts.\n*It's unknown why Walburga and Orion never joined the Death Eaters, though it's likely that they merely hoped to reap the benefits of their cause, especially because they, as Sirius claims, were very pleased when Regulus became a Death Eater.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Walburga Black}}\n*{{OOTP}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{OOTP|F}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{OOTP|G}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{DH}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{DH|G1}} {{Portrait}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}} {{1st}}\n*{{PM}} {{Mention}}\n*{{HPV|CR}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=[[Irma Crabbe|Irma]] and [[Pollux Black]]\n|position=Owner of [[12 Grimmauld Place]]\n|years=???-[[1985]]\n|successor=[[Sirius Black]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n[[de:Walburga Black]]\n[[es:Walburga Black]]\n[[fi:Walburga Musta]]\n[[fr:Walburga Black]]\n[[nl:Walburga Zwarts]]\n[[ru:\u0412\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430 \u0411\u043b\u044d\u043a]]\n[[pl:Walburga Black]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Black, Walburga}}\n[[Category:1925 births]]\n[[Category:1985 deaths]]\n[[Category:Dark wizards]]\n[[Category:Death Eater allies]]\n[[Category:English individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts students during the Riddle-era]]\n[[Category:House of Black]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Portraits]]\n[[Category:Pure-blood supremacists]]\n[[Category:Pure-bloods]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1930s]]\n[[Category:Widowed individuals]]"
