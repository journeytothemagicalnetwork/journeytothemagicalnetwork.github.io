He traded [[syrup of Hellebore]] with [[Harry Potter]] in order to get the horned slugs he needed. He was also a member of the [[Duelling Club]].<ref name=\"HBPG\">{{HBP|G}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Kouta\" is from Japanese \u5eb7 (kou) \"peace\" and \u592a (ta) \"thick, big\".\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*It is most likely that Kouta was in his [[fifth year]] in the [[1996\u20131997 school year]], as the Draught of Peace is usually brewed in that year.\n*Given his name, he is most likely of Japanese descent.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{PS2 only}} {{1st}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Duelling Club}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ohnishi, Kouta}}\n[[es:Kouta Ohnishi]]\n[[fr:Kouta Ohnishi]]\n[[pl:Kouta Ohnishi]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Duelling Club members]]\n[[Category:Hufflepuffs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
