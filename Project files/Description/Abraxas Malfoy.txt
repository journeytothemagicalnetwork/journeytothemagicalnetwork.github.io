[[1954]]-[[1968]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], a member of the [[Malfoy family]], father of [[Lucius Malfoy]], grandfather of [[Draco Malfoy]] and great-grandfather of [[Scorpius Malfoy]]. He was related by marriage to the [[House of Black|Blacks]], through his daughter-in-law [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]], and, more distantly, to the [[Lestrange family|Lestranges]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{dialogue a-b|Draco Malfoy |Sir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas Malfoy?|Horace Slughorn|Yes. I was sorry to hear he had died, although of course it wasn't unexpected, dragon pox at his age...|[[Draco Malfoy]] seeking favour from Horace Slughorn|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\nIn his youth, Abraxas attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin]] house.<ref name=\"PS5\" /><ref name=\"COS9\" />\n\nAbraxas had at least one child, [[Lucius Malfoy]], who was born in late [[1953]] or [[1954]];<ref name=\"OP15\">{{OOTP|B|15}}</ref> the fate of Lucius's mother, Abraxas's wife, is currently unknown. Abraxas apparently knew [[Horace Slughorn]], according to his grandson [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] and Slughorn himself.<ref name=\"HBP9\">{{HBP|B|9}}</ref>\n\nAbraxas Malfoy was widely believed to have been part of the shady plot that, in [[1968]], forced [[Minister for Magic]] [[Nobby Leach]] (the first [[Muggle-born]] ever to have held the office) to leave his post prematurely. Nothing was, however, conclusively proven against Malfoy.<ref name=\"pottermore\">{{WW|the-malfoy-family}}</ref>\n\nAbraxas [[Death|died]] of a case of [[Dragon Pox]], a relatively common malady of the elderly, some time before September [[1996]]. [[Horace Slughorn]] knew him at one time and was sorry to hear that he had passed away, as he informed Abraxas's grandson [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]].<ref name=\"HBP9\"/> Abraxas may also have been a well-respected wizard, as Draco attempted to use his name to charm Slughorn into letting Draco into the [[Slug Club]], because Slughorn was impressed with heritage. However, perhaps due to Lucius's renewed criminal records, the name was not good enough to earn Slughorn's favour.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''[[Wikipedia:Abraxas|Abraxas]]'' was engraved on stones that were considered amulets in the Ancient Roman-Greco world. They often had figures carved on them as well that resembled [[basilisk]]s or [[chimaera]]s. The name may be related to the word ''abracadabra'', which is notable as this may also be the root of the [[Killing Curse]] incantation ''\"Avada Kedavra\"''. The name Abraxas is also mentioned in Gnostic texts, and in Ancient Egyptian mythology as a god or [[demon]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*It's possible that as since Draco used his name to get Slughorn's attention, Abraxas was a member of the [[Slug Club]], though this is unconfirmed.\n*Interestingly his plot to remove Nobby Leach from the Ministry happened approximately two years before the [[First Wizarding War]] began. It's unknown if the two events are connected however, though the [[Death Eaters]] would have nonetheless benefited from Leach's removal.\n*It is curious that Abraxas died of a case of Dragon Pox, as did [[Fleamont Potter]], grandfather of his grandson's Hogwarts rival, [[Harry Potter]]. Also, it is possible that Fleamont is related to [[Charlus Potter]] and [[Dorea Black]], a great-uncle and great-aunt of [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Black]], his daughter-in-law, indicating that, over and above any enmity, both the Malfoy and [[Potter family|Potter]] families are distantly related.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{HBP}} {{1st Mention}}\n*{{PM}} {{Mention}}\n*{{WW}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Malfoy, Abraxas}}\n[[de:Abraxas Malfoy]]\n[[es:Abraxas Malfoy]]\n[[fr:Abraxas Malefoy]]\n[[it:Abraxas Malfoy]]\n[[ru:\u0410\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0441 \u041c\u0430\u043b\u0444\u043e\u0439]]\n[[pl:Abraxas Malfoy]]\n[[pt-br:Abraxas Malfoy]]\n[[de2:Abraxas Malfoy]]\n[[Category:20th century deaths]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Deaths from dragon pox]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Malfoy family]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Pure-blood supremacists]]\n[[Category:Pure-bloods]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
