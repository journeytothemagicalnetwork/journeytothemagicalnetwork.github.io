"Christian Alexander was a Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He once signed up for Quidditch training at 7pm on Tuesday on a sign-up sheet that was posted on the bulletin board in the Gryffindor Common Room.\"Christian\" is from the Medieval Latin name 'Christianus' meaning \"a Christian\". In England it has been in use since the Middle Ages, during which time it was used by both males and females, but it did not become common until the 17th century.\"Alexander\" is from the personal name Alexander, classical Greek Alexandros, which probably originally meant repulser of men (i.e. of the enemy), from alexein to repel + andros, genitive of aner man. Its popularity in the Middle Ages was due mainly to the Macedonian conqueror, Alexander the Great (356323 bc)or rather to the hero of the mythical versions of his exploits that gained currency in the so-called Alexander Romances.The Wizarding World of Harry Potter (Mentioned on a poster)"
