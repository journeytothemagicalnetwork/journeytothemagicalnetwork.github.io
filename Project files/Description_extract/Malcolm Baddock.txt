"Malcolm Baddock (born c. 1982-1983) was a wizard and Slytherin student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry three years below Harry Potter. His arrival at the Slytherin table immediately after being Sorted in 1994 was met with applause from Draco Malfoy, but Fred and George Weasley hissed at him, and Harry privately wondered if Malcolm was aware of Slytherin House's sinister reputation.Malcolm means \"disciple of St Columba,\" a sixth century Irish saint who established a convent on the island of Iona. This was the name of four kings of Scotland starting in the 10th century, including Malcolm III, who became king after killing Macbeth, the usurper who had murdered his father.Afrikaans: Malcolm BasanaBulgarian:  Chinese (Simplified): \\xb7Chinese (Traditional): \\xb7Danish: Malcolm Slemmer (Slem \"bad\")Dutch: Melchior BeulsvreugdHebrew:  Japanese: Lithuanian: Malkolmas BlogulisNorwegian: Hugo BalleramPortuguese: Malcom BaddockSerbian:  a (Malkolm Badok)The following languages are the same as the original:Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (First appearance)"
