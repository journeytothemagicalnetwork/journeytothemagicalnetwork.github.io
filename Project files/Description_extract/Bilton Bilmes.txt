"Bilton Bilmes was a British wizard who, during the 1980s, was living in the Highlands of Scotland, having taken up both residence and employment in the picturesque little all-wizarding village of Hogsmeade as the proprietor of Zonko's Joke Shop.Bilton Bilmes was born somewhere in the British Isles into a wizarding family of unknown blood status, and attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. During his school career, if his later profession is any indication, he was well known for his sense of humour. Sometime either during his schooling or after he graduated from Hogwarts, he poured Bulbadox powder in Horace Slughorn's mead as a prank. It is also unknown what House he was sorted into whilst at Hogwarts.He once accidentally set off some Stink Pellets in the closet in his home and, unable to get the smell out, resolved to burn every piece of clothing he owned and buy new ones, only to accidentally burn his home to the ground in the process. This mistake would haunt him for many years to come. By the 1980s, Bilton had settled down in Hogsmeade Village and took up a job at the local joke shop. Loud and affable, and with a childlike fondness and enthusiasm for pranks and mischief, Bilton was always happy to accommodate the young scoundrels of Hogwarts Castle with the latest within classical trouble-making whenever they came to his shop looking for prank devices, and actively encouraged their practical jokes.Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (First appearance)"
