"Eliza was a witch who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was a member of Ravenclaw House. Eliza was born somewhere in Great Britain or Ireland during the early 1970s. She began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 19851986 school year, where she was sorted into Ravenclaw. Eliza was revising for her Potions exam late one night in the Ravenclaw Common Room, and the next day she could not find her notes. She thought another pupil might have used the Severing Charm on her bag, which made them fall out. Eliza then searched the common room for the notes, which she eventually found.The search for Eliza's notes was a specific assignment for Ravenclaw only players in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery. In the game, Rowan Khanna tells Jacob's sibling why Eliza needs their help and they agree to search the room with her. Eliza was very grateful for their help and went to tell Professor Flitwick about their kindness towards first year Ravenclaws.Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (First appearance)"
