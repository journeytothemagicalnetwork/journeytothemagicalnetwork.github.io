"Daisy Corran was a Ravenclaw student who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1990 or 1991. During the 19961997 school year, she, Banga O'Deluga, and Justin Steele gave Harry Potter two Beater's bats in exchange for six Gobstones while in the Paved Courtyard. Later that same term, she could be found in the seventh floor corridor, where she traded potions for chess pieces.The name \"Daisy\" is from the English word for the white flower, ultimately derived from Old English d\\xe6geseage meaning \"day eye\". It was first used as a given name in the 19th century, at the same time many other plant and flower names were coined.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (PS2 version only)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS version only)"
