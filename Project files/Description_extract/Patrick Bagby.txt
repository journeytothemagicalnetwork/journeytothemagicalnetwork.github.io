"Patrick Bagby was a wizard and Hufflepuff student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s.He could usually be found wandering around the second-floor stairs during the 19961997 school year. Patrick was known to dislike the game of Quidditch, but his mother on the other hand, was very fond of it. She said that if he worked harder he would be a good Seeker, but Patrick was simply more interested in playing chess.He hated Potions, because Professor Slughorn was only interested in famous people.Patrick is from the Latin name Patricius, which meant \"nobleman\". This name was adopted in the 5th-century by Saint Patrick, whose birth name was Sucat. He was a Romanized Briton who was captured and enslaved in his youth by Irish raiders. After six years of servitude he escaped home, but he eventually became a bishop and went back to Ireland as a missionary. He is traditionally credited with Christianizing the island, and is regarded as Ireland's patron saint.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (First appearance)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS version only)"
