"Stephen Cornfoot (c. 1979-1980) was a pure-blood wizard who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991. He was in the same year as Harry Potter and was Sorted into either Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw house.The name \"Stephen\" is from the Greek name  (Stephanos) meaning \"crown\". Saint Stephen was a deacon who was stoned to death, as told in Acts in the New Testament, and he is regarded as the first Christian martyr. Due to him, the name became common in the Christian world. It was popularised in England by the Normans.Stephen Cornfoot is listed as a Ravenclaw on the list of students in a page of J. K. Rowling's notes shown on Harry Potter and Me. However, as two listed Hufflepuffs (Anthony Goldstein and Michael Corner) had their houses changed to Ravenclaw in the novels as published, two of those listed as Ravenclaws must have been changed to Hufflepuff. Cornfoot may be one of those whose house was changed.Harry Potter and Me (First mentioned)Pottermore (Mentioned only)Wizarding World (Mentioned only)"
