"Alexander William was a wizard and Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He once signed up for Quidditch training at 7pm on Saturday on a sign-up sheet that was posted on the bulletin board in the Gryffindor Common Room.The name \"Alexander\" is the Latinized form of the Greek name  (Alexandros), which meant \"defending men\" from Greek  (alexo) \"to defend, help\" and  (aner) \"man\" (genitive , \"andros\"). In Greek mythology this was another name of the hero Paris, and it also belongs to several characters in the New Testament. However, the most famous bearer was Alexander the Great, King of Macedon. In the 4th century BC he built a huge empire out of Greece, Egypt, Persia, and parts of India. Due to his fame, and later medieval tales involving him, use of his name spread throughout Europe.The Wizarding World of Harry Potter (First mentioned) (Mentioned on a poster)"
