"This girl was a Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry student from 1858 to 1865.During her Sorting ceremony on 1 September, 1858, her name was called, but Angus Buchanan, a Squib pretending to actually be a wizard who was among the crowd of first-years, threw himself ahead of her in sheer desperation and placed the Sorting Hat upon his head. The Hat announced kindly that he was \"a good-hearted chap, but no wizard\", and the boy left the hall in tears.Depending on her month of birth, this girl may have been a classmate of Phineas Nigellus Black at Hogwarts.Pottermore (Mentioned only)Wizarding World (Mentioned only)"
