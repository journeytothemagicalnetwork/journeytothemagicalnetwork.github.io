"J. E. Prewitt was a wizard or witch and a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the late 1970s.Prewitt played Seeker for their house Quidditch team, and won an award for it in 1978. A fellow Seeker's name, D. L. Boot was placed alongside theirs.In Harry Potter Limited Edition - A Guide to the Graphic Arts Department: Posters, Prints, and Publications from the Harry Potter Films, the text says that this individual may be a relative of \"Molly Weasley, n\\xe9e Prewitt\" [sic]. However, Molly's maiden name was \"Prewett\", not \"Prewitt\". It's likely that this individual's surname is simply a misspelling.Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) (Name appears on trophy)Harry Potter Limited Edition (Name appears on trophy)"
