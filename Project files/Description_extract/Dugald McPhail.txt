"Minister Dugald McPhail was a wizard. A Hufflepuff in his Hogwarts years, he rose to the office of Minister for Magic, serving from 1858 to 1865.Dugald McPhail was born on an unknown date, no later than 1841, to at least one magical parent. His surname, coupled with the fact that he spoke in a heavy Scottish brogue, implies he was from Scotland, or had Scottish ancestry.In his youth, he attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he was Sorted into Hufflepuff.McPhail was appointed Minister for Magic, sometime after leaving Hogwarts, from 1858 to 1865.. He was elected Minister at least once, perhaps twice.During his time as Minister, McPhail came up with the idea of mimicking the then-new Muggle bus service to provide underage and infirm witches and wizards with a discreet method of transportation, leading to the introduction of the Knight Bus in 1865.His overall term in office was viewed as \"successful\" by Gabriel Truman in the 1990s.On 1 September, 1991, Prefect Gabriel Truman welcomed the Hufflepuff first years to Hufflepuff Basement with a short speech in which he mentioned former Minister Dugald McPhail as one of the many notable Hogwarts students who were Sorted, like them, into Hufflepuff.Pottermore (First mentioned)Wizarding World (Mentioned only)"
