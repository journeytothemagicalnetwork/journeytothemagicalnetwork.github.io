"Anthony Otterburn was a wizard and Hufflepuff student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s.He liked Herbology, and could often be found in the second Herbology greenhouse, as being around the plants made him feel calm. In 1996 he told Harry Potter that he could use Accio to collect the flower heads that he needed to make the Draught of Living Death for Potions.Later in the year, he joined the Duelling Club run by Maynard Hatton in the Training Grounds.The name \"Anthony\" is from the English form of the Roman family name Antonius, which is of unknown Etruscan origin. The most notable member of the Roman family was the general Marcus Antonius (called Mark Antony in English), who for a period in the 1st century BC ruled the Roman Empire jointly with Augustus. When their relationship turned sour, he and his mistress Cleopatra were attacked and forced to commit suicide, as related in Shakespeare's tragedy 'Antony and Cleopatra' (1606).Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (First appearance) (Console versions)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS version only)"
