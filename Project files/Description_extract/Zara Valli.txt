"Zara Valli was a witch and Hufflepuff student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s. On the first day of the 19961997 school year, she had to go to the library, in order to do research for a fifteen-inch essay she had to write for Charms. She agreed to give Harry Potter some Moondew in exchange for two Gobstones while there. Later in the year, she could be found in the Viaduct, where she traded Gobstones for potions.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (First appearance) (Console versions)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS version only)"
