"Albert was a wizard and student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, who was sorted into Hufflepuff in the 1990s. He said that Argus Filch talked to his cat suggesting that he was a character in the plot to open the Chamber of Secrets, and that Filch punished him for being out of bed at night time. He said that he wished there would be an Heir of Hufflepuff and asked Harry Potter if he could say Albert in Parseltongue. He once got a bag of beetle pincers by owl.He may be related to Marilyn and Arthur by the fact that he is a Hufflepuff, shared the same love for beetle pincers and the out-of-universe fact that he only appeared in the PC version of the game.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) (First mentioned) (PC version only)"
