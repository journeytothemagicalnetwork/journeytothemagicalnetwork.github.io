"Angelica Cole was a witch who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1980 and was Sorted into Gryffindor. In 1984, she was made a Prefect, and was responsible for watching over the first years.Angelica was still at Hogwarts the following two years and graduated in 1987.Angelica became a Prefect in 1984. She also became the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.In the 19861987 school year, she met up with Jacob's sibling and Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington. She revealed that she had always liked Jacob.She graduated from Hogwarts in 1987, and went on to join the Ministry. Angelica meeting up with some other Prefects After Hogwarts, Angelica was employed training Security trolls for the British Ministry of Magic.In September 1988, she met up in the Three Broomsticks Inn with other former Prefects Chester Davies, Jane Court and Felix Rosier, as well as Head Boy William Weasley and Prefects at the time like Charlie Weasley and Jacob's sibling. At the end of the school year, in the summer of 1989, she attended Bill Weasley's graduation celebration in the same location.Charms: Angelia was proficient with the casting of charms, such as the Freezing Charm. She also tutored first year students with the Wand-Lighting Charm as part of her prefect duties at Hogwarts.Potions: Angelica was skilled with the brewing of potions, such as Babbling Beverage.Herbology: Angelia was skilled with the handling of magical plants, such as Snargaluff.Care of Magical Creatures: Angelica was talented with the handling and training of dangerous magical beasts, such as with trolls, as she became a trainer of Security trolls for the Ministry of Magic in her adulthood.Flying: Angelina was presumably a skilled broomstick flyer and Quidditch player, as she was appointed the Quidditch Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team whilst at Hogwarts.In Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, given the fact that she left the Gryffindor vs Slytherin match early in her sixth year (for Ravenclaw and Slytherin players), it is possible she only became a regular on the Gryffindor Quidditch team in her seventh year, during which she was the team's Captain. This would not be the only case of a new player becoming Quidditch Captain, as it was the case with Urquhart and the Slytherin Quidditch team in the 19961997 school year.If Jacob's sibling is in Gryffindor, her position as Quidditch Captain causes a contradiction, as Orion Amari holds the position in the 19861987 school year.It is possible she came up with a few offensive flying formations.Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (First appearance)"
