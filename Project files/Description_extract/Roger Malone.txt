"Roger Malone (c. 1979-1980) was a wizard who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991. He was in the same year as Harry Potter and was Sorted into either Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw house.The name \"Malone\" comes from an Irish surname, an anglicised form of \\xd3 Maoil Eoin meaning \"descendent of a disciple of Saint John\".Roger Malone can been deduced to have been listed as a Ravenclaw on the list of students in a page of J. K. Rowling's notes shown on Harry Potter and Me. However, as two listed Hufflepuffs (Anthony Goldstein and Michael Corner) had their houses changed to Ravenclaw in the novels as published, two of those listed as Ravenclaws must have been changed to Hufflepuff. Malone may be one of those whose house was changed.Harry Potter and Me (First mentioned)Pottermore (Mentioned only)Wizarding World (Mentioned only)"
