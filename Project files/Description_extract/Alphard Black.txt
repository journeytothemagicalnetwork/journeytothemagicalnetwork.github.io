"Alphard Black (between 1925 and 1938  1976/1977) was a pure-blood wizard from the noble House of Black and was a Slytherin student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.Alphard was the middle child of Pollux Black and Irma Crabbe, and brother of Walburga and Cygnus. He was born sometime after his sister and before his brother and grew up in 12 Grimmauld Place. Alphard was burnt off from the Black family tree tapestry after his disownment Alphard passed away from unknown causes sometime in 1976 or 1977. In his will, he left a \"decent amount of gold\" to his nephew Sirius Black, who was seventeen at the time. He was posthumously disowned and removed from the Black family tree tapestry by Sirius' mother, Walburga, and Sirius believed that this act of charity towards him was the reason why.Judging from Alphard's action of helping his nephew when he ran away from home, it can be deduced that he was, at the very least, capable of love and fondness. It can therefore be inferred that he might have been kind and compassionate in his life, which made Alphard vastly different from his sister Walburga Black and his younger brother Cygnus Black III for that matter, in that he wasn't bothered about his nephew being a blood traitor. He did not seem to fear being blasted off the tapestry, thus indicating that, like his nephew, he himself had a rebellious or brave bone. He shared similarities with his niece Andromeda Tonks and his distant relative Cedrella Black, in that they were all the middle child of three, sorted into Slytherin, and disowned.Like many members of the Black family, Alphard is named after a star. Alphard is the brightest star in the constellation Hydra, and is known as the heart of the serpent. Its name is derived from the Arabic | (Al Fard), meaning \"the solitary one\".Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (First mentioned)Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film) (Appears on Black family tree tapestry)Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game) (Seen on Black family tree tapestry)Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (video game) (Seen on Black family tree tapestry)"
