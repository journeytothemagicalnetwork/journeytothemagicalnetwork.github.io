"Toad Toazer (also spelled Tozer) was a Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s.Toad's name was included on a list of students with overdue library books that was posted on a bulletin board in the Gryffindor common room by Madam Pince.Toad personally signed up to join the Hogwarts Gobstone Club on a sign-up sheet that was posted on the Gryffindor noticeboard. Toad also registered for a trip to Hogsmeade on another sign-up sheet posted on the Gryffindor bulletin board, which was scheduled for Saturday the 15th in an unknown month.This character is mentioned only on three prop notices that have been featured in at least one Harry Potter film. On the first notice, their name was spelled \"Toad Toazer,\" and on the the second and third, it was was spelled \"Toad Tozer.\" However, since all instances of the name are from the same house and time frame, they can be assumed to refer to the same person, with one variation presumably being a misspelling.This character's name is presumably a tribute to Philosopher's Stone set designer Sarah \"Toad\" Tozer.Harry Potter films (Mentioned on a poster)"
