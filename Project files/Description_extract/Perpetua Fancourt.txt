Perhaps in an attempt to further the study of her area of expertise, she invented an optical device to counter the difficulty of working with moon charts, which she named lunascope.

In her honour, her achievement, the invention of the lunascope, was recorded on a Chocolate Frog Card.On 1 September, 1991, Prefect Robert Hilliard welcomed the Ravenclaw first years to Ravenclaw Tower with a short speech in which he mentioned inventor Perpetua Fancourt as one of the many notable Hogwarts students who had been sorted, like them, into Ravenclaw.Astronomy: Fancourt was a celebrated and highly accomplished professional Astronomer with much knowledge of this branch of both magic and science. She specialised in the study of moons, and even invented her own Astronomical device, the Lunascope, to help overcome the difficulty of Moon charts, a very impressive achievement in the field which gained her recognition on a Chocolate Frog Card.The name \"Perpetua\" is derived from Latin perpetuus meaning \"continuous\".Based on her year of birth, she would have been three or four years below Newt Scamander, who owned one of her Lunascopes, during their school years at Hogwarts, though it is unknown if they knew each other.Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) (Appears on a Famous Wizard Card)Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) (Appears on a Famous Wizard Card)Pottermore (Mentioned only)"
