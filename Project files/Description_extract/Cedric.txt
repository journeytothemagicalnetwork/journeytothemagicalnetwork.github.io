"Cedric was a wizard and student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the early 1990s. In 1991, he borrowed a writing quill from a female Hufflepuff student.It is highly likely that this individual is Cedric Diggory, as he would have been in his third year.The name \"Cedric\" was invented by Sir Walter Scott for a character in his novel Ivanhoe (1819). Apparently he based it on the actual name Cerdic, the name of the semi-legendary founder of the kingdom of Wessex in the 6th-century. The meaning of Cerdic is uncertain, but it does not appear to be Old English in origin.Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) (First mentioned)"
