"Bertram Aubrey was a student at Hogwarts in the 1970s. Once, he had an illegal hex (perhaps Engorgio Skullus) used on him by James Potter and Sirius Black which caused his head to grow twice its original size. It is unknown what motivated the duo to hex him, though it rewarded them a double detention.The name Bertram means \"bright raven\", from Germanic roots. The name meaning has quite a connection with the Ravenclaw house (bright as in witty, and raven as in Ravenclaw), which could lead to speculation that Bertram Aubrey was a Ravenclaw.The name Aubrey has multiple meanings. It can mean \"noble and bright\", \"blond ruler\" and \"rules with elf wisdom\". This could also connect him to Ravenclaw, being \"bright\".Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (First mentioned)"
