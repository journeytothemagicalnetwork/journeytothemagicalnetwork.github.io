In revenge, George Weasley elbowed Bole in the face, leading Madam Hooch to give both teams penalties.In Bole's seventh year, the Triwizard Tournament lead all Quidditch games at Hogwarts to be cancelled, but he nonetheless nominally retained his position on the Slytherin team until his graduation in June 1995. He and fellow Slytherin Beater, Peregrine Derrick, were replaced by Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle at the beginning of the next Quidditch season. Angelina Johnson, the new captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, was glad to see Bole and Derrick gone, stating mockingly that she was always stunned the pair were able to find their way to Quidditch pitch without directions.Lucian Bole, like many fellow members of the Slytherin Quidditch team, was shown to possess poor sportsmanship and a preference for committing fouls against rival players.Flying: Despite his unreasonable behaviour on the Quidditch pitch, Bole was nonetheless evidently an accomplished and talented broomstick flyer and Quidditch player, as he played as Beater for the Slytherin Quidditch team.This character is known only by his surname in the Harry Potter books. His first name is given as \"Lucian\" in the video game Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup.It is possible that Bole is the Unidentified Slytherin Beater seen in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, meaning he could have played in the 19911992 school year.
