"David Nolton was a Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s.He was usually seen spending time at the stairs by the second-floor during the 1996-1997 school year. He traded many things (Chocolate Frog Cards, chess pieces, and Butterbeer) for Gobstones.The name \"David\" comes from the Hebrew name  (Dawid), which was probably derived from Hebrew  (dwd) meaning \"beloved\". King David was the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel according to the Hebrew Bible.This particular student was only featured in the PlayStation 2 version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Nintendo DS version of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (PS2 version only)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS version only)"
