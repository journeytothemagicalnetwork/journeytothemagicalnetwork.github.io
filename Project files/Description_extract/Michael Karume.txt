"Michael Karume was a Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s.He told Harry Potter that he could find lost Gobstones in bushes during the 19961997 school year.The name \"Michael\" comes from the Hebrew name  (Mikha'el) meaning \"who is like God?\". This is a rhetorical question, implying no person is like God.This particular student was only featured in the PlayStation 2 version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Nintendo DS version of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (PS2 version only)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS version only)"
