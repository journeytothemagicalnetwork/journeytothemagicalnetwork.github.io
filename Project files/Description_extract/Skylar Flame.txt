"Skylar Flame was a wizard or witch who founded the Sphinx Club at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the 1800s.In their youth, Flame received their magical education from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Flame was in a study group with Margaretta Ironbark and Olin Oakwood. They pressured Olin to compete in the tournament, along with Margaretta. The competition got the best of them and turned them into grudging enemies. After he defeated them and won the tournament, their study group fell apart and each of them formed their own clubs, each one dedicated to the areas of study that suited them best.At some point, Flame wrote a historical manuscript that was entitled, \"Olin the Cheat\". The contents of this dissertation detailed the dastardly deeds of a cruel wizard. Flame wrote that Olin had lied to her and pretended to be her friend.Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (First mentioned)"
