"Face Paint Kid was the nickname of a wizard who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1980s. He preferred being known by that moniker rather than his birth name.A huge fan of Quidditch, he was known for testing other students' knowledge of the sport with what he called his \"patented quidditch quiz\" and for wearing elaborate face paint during matches. During the 19851986 school year, before Jacob's sibling attended their first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, he quizzed them on their knowledge. Unfortunately, his face paint design for that match didn't turn out as he had hoped, but Penny Haywood helped him by using the Colour Change Charm to correct it to his House colours.When Jacob's sibling became a Beater in the 19861987 school year and a Keeper in the 19871988 school year, Face Paint Kid quizzed them two more times, each on Beater and Keeper knowledge.He is in whichever house the player chose for Jacob's sibling.He likes nicknames.According to Penny Haywood, Face Paint Kid is an even bigger Quidditch fan than she is, and creates the coolest face paint designs.Even though Jacob's sibling had just joined his 'Quidditch Fans' group and almost immediately the Quidditch Team, they became his favourite player.Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (First appearance)"
