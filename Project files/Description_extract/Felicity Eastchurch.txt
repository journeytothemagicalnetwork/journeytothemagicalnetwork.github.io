"Felicity Eastchurch was a witch and Ravenclaw student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s.In 1996, she took a handbag belonging to Luna Lovegood, intending to hide it from her as a prank. Luna wanted to take this handbag to Professor Slughorn's Christmas party as part of her outfit. Harry Potter had to give Felicity three Stink Pellets and six chess pieces to get her to return the handbag. She also competed in the school Exploding Snap tournament during that year.The name \"Felicity\" is from the English word felicity meaning \"happiness\", which ultimately derives from Latin felicitas \"good luck\".
