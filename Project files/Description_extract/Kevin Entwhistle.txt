Saint Caoimh\\xedn established a monastery in Glendalough, Ireland in the 6th century and is the patron saint of Dublin.Entwhistle could be a form of Entwistle which is an English habitual name from the village of Entwisle in Lancashire, named from Old English henna (water) hen or ened duck + twisla tongue of land in a river fork[1].Kevin Entwhistle is listed as a Ravenclaw on the list of students in a page of J. K. Rowling's notes shown on Harry Potter and Me. However, as two listed Hufflepuffs (Anthony Goldstein and Michael Corner) had their houses changed to Ravenclaw in the novels as published, two of those listed as Ravenclaws must have been changed to Hufflepuff. Entwhistle may be one of those whose house was changed.Harry Potter and Me (First mentioned)Pottermore (Mentioned only)Wizarding World (Mentioned only)"
