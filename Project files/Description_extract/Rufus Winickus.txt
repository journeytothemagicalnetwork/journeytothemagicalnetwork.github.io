"Rufus Winickus was a Slytherin student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1950s. He was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team from 1956 to 1960.The name \"Rufus\" is a Roman cognomen which meant \"red-haired\" in Latin. Several early saints had this name, including one mentioned in one of Paul's epistles in the New Testament. As a nickname it was used by William II Rufus, a king of England, because of his red hair. It came into general use in the English-speaking world after the Protestant Reformation.This character is mentioned only on a plaque that was featured in at least one of the Harry Potter films. His name is presumably a tribute to Ruth Winick, who worked as a graphic artist on Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, and as a draughtsman on Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire.Harry Potter films (Name appears on plaque)"
