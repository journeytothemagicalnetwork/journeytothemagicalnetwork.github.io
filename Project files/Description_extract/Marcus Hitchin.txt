"Marcus Hitchin was a wizard and Ravenclaw student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s.He was known to have used Fred and George Weasley's Skiving Snackboxes. Unlike most people who considered Slughorn a placeholder, Trevor thought that he was a good teacher. One day, Slughorn was duelling Marcus and beat him. The blow was so powerful that he needed two days in the Hospital Wing to recover. He was a fan of Gilderoy Lockhart.The name \"Marcus\" is a Roman praenomen, or given name, which was probably derived from the name of the Roman god Mars. Famous Roman bearers of this name were Marcus Tullius Cicero (known simply as Cicero), a 1st-century BC statesman and orator, Marcus Antonius (known as Mark Antony), a 1st-century BC politician, and Marcus Aurelius, a notable 2nd-century emperor.This particular student was only featured in the console versions of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Nintendo DS version of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (First appearance) (Console versions)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS version only)"
