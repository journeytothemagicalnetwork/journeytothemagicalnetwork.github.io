"Gareth Pewsey was a Hufflepuff student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s. He competed in the school Gobstones tournament during the 19961997 school year.The meaning of the name \"Gareth\" is unknown. It first appears in this form in Thomas Malory's 15th-century compilation of Arthurian legends Le Morte d'Arthur, in which Gareth was a knight of the Round Table, the brother of Sir Gawain. Malory based the name on Gahariet, which was the name of a similar Arthurian character in French sources. It may ultimately have a Welsh origin, possibly related to gwaredd meaning \"gentleness\".This particular student was only featured in the PlayStation 2 version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Nintendo DS version of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (PS2 version only)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS version only)"
