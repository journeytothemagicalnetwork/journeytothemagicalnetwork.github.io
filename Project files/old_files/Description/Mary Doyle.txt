The meaning is not known for certain, but there are several theories including \"sea of bitterness\", \"rebelliousness\", and \"wished for child\". However it was most likely originally an Egyptian name, perhaps derived in part from ''mry'' \"beloved\" or mr \"love\".\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{PS2 only}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[pl:Mary Doyle]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doyle, Mary}}\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizard Skittles Players]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
