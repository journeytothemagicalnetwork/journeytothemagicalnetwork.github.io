He came from a line of [[Dark Wizard]]s and [[Death Eaters]], with his [[Crabbe|father]] and possibly grandfather before him.\n\nVincent Crabbe was also a student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and a member of [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. Crabbe and [[Gregory Goyle]] were rarely seen without their ringleader [[Draco Malfoy]]. While [[Dolores Umbridge]] was [[Headmaster|Headmistress]], he joined the [[Inquisitorial Squad]] with Goyle and Malfoy. In his last year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], he became a [[Dark Wizard]]. He learned to cast powerful [[Dark Arts|dark]] [[curse]]s, such as the [[Killing Curse|Killing]] and the [[Cruciatus Curse]]s. He accidentally killed himself using [[Fiendfyre]] on [[2 May]] [[1998]] in the [[Room of Requirement]], during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nVincent Crabbe was born into the [[pure-blood]] [[Crabbe family]]. His father, [[Crabbe|Mr Crabbe]], was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]. This likely influenced his son's [[Pure-blood supremacy|prejudice]] against [[Muggle-born]]s and other non-pure-bloods. Vincent was related, in some way, to [[Irma Crabbe|Irma Black]] {{Comment|n\u00e9e Crabbe}}.\n\n===Hogwarts years {{Comment|1991-1998}}===\n====First year====\n{{Quote|Oh, this is Crabbe and Goyle.

Ron and Harry used hairs from Crabbe and Goyle to impersonate them, as components of a [[Polyjuice Potion]], and spy on Malfoy in the [[Slytherin]] [[Common room]] (Hermione did not go as [[Millicent Bulstrode]] because she had used cat hairs, thinking they were Millicent's hairs from her robes, transforming her partly into a cat).<ref name=\"COS\">{{COS}}</ref>\n\n====Third year====\n{{Quote|Malfoy's head jerked forward as the mud hit him; his silverblond hair was suddenly dripping in muck...

During the [[Slytherin]] vs. [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|Gryffindor]] [[Quidditch]] match, Crabbe sent a [[Bludger]] at Harry, angry because he caught the [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]] before Draco (the Seeker then) did. Harry got into a fight alongside [[George Weasley]] and got a lifetime ban from Quidditch, courtesy of [[Dolores Umbridge]]. Crabbe was happy about this; Harry Potter's and George Weasley's Quidditch bans were lifted when Umbridge was removed from Hogwarts.<ref name=\"OOTP\">{{OOTP}}</ref>\n\nAfter Harry caused the arrest of Crabbe's father, [[Crabbe|Mr Crabbe]] and [[Lucius Malfoy]], Malfoy's father, they attempted to ambush him on the [[Hogwarts Express]] but were jinxed so thoroughly and variously by members of the D.A. that they were transfigured into large slugs.

Whenever someone walked by, Crabbe or Goyle would drop an object, making a loud noise that would alert Malfoy not to come out. Crabbe was displeased at being made to do this, especially since Malfoy refused to tell him what he was doing inside. Once, Crabbe started to argue with Malfoy about this.

''Avada Kedavra''!|Crabbe trying to curse [[Harry Potter]] and [[Hermione Granger]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}During Crabbe's [[1996\u20131997 school year|seventh year]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], two new professors were appointed; [[Amycus Carrow|Amycus]] and [[Alecto Carrow]]. Amycus was the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts|Dark Arts]] professor, while Alecto was the [[Muggle Studies]] professor. They both liked to punish students, torturing them; they also ordered the other students to torture the punished ones with the [[Cruciatus Curse]]; it is noted that Crabbe and Goyle were among the few ones who loved it. It was also the very first time they got top grades in something.<ref name=\"DH\">{{DH}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Crabbe, Goyle, and Malfoy stayed at Hogwarts and they ambushed Harry, Ron, and Hermione in the [[Room of Requirement]]. It turned out that Crabbe had become a competent Dark wizard, thanks to the coaching of Death Eater Amycus Carrow, seeing that he was capable of performing the [[Killing Curse]], which was claimed by [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] (while posing as [[Alastor Moody]]) to require a \"''powerful bit of magic behind it.''\" It, like all the [[Unforgivable Curses]], also needed (Harry himself proved with Bellatrix) a genuine desire to injure, maim, or kill behind it to be effective, and Crabbe frequently demonstrated this level of malevolence.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\n[[File:Fiendfyre DHF2.gif|frame|The [[Fiendfyre]] in the [[Room of Requirement]] caused by Crabbe]]\n\nInitially, Harry mocked Crabbe and the others, thinking they were merely here to make fools of themselves in an attempt to capture Harry himself. However, when Crabbe aimed to kill, Harry became greatly infuriated. For the first time Crabbe defied Draco, stating \"''you an' [[Lucius Malfoy|yer dad]] are finished'',\" implying a great deal of knowledge regarding the Malfoy family's falling out of favour with Voldemort. Crabbe then conjured [[Fiendfyre]] in an attempt to kill the trio, but he failed to learn how to stop it. It killed him and destroyed the entire Room of Requirement before he could escape.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\n{{Quote|Like it hot, scum?|Crabbe's final words.|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\nNone of the students who escaped (except for Malfoy and Goyle) saw his death, and the others presumed that it killed him, as no one saw him leave the room. Ironically, his use of Fiendfyre also destroyed [[Ravenclaw's diadem]], one of Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es, due to the destructive power of the spell. Ron reflected that such an action might have made him feel sorry for Crabbe's death if he hadn't been trying to kill them when he used it.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nFor his disobedience of orders during their final reunion which nearly cost Goyle's life and his own, Draco held the deceased Crabbe in low esteem.\n\nIn [[2020]], while talking with Harry at the [[Ministry of Magic]], Draco revealed that he was always jealous about Harry having Ron and Hermione as friends while he had Crabbe and Goyle.<ref name=\"CC\">{{CC}}</ref>\n\n==Physical description==\nCrabbe was large and very fat, with a thick neck. He had gorilla-like arms, a flat nose, and wore a pudding bowl-style haircut. He was very mean and very stupid, which makes him little more than a \"follower\" of Malfoy. However, in spite of his overweight, fat physique, he was an avid runner, as shown when he, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Malfoy and Goyle were running away from the Fiendfyre. Crabbe is told to have outstripped the rest of them, even Harry, who was very quick.\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Dialogue a-b|Angelina Johnson|Well, they don\u2019t look bright enough to tell one end of a broom from another, but I was always surprised [[Peregrine Derrick|Derrick]] and [[Lucian Bole|Bole]] managed to find their way onto the pitch without signposts.|Harry Potter|Crabbe and Goyle are in the same mould.|[[Angelina Johnson]] and [[Harry Potter]] commenting on Crabbe and Goyle's stupidity|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\nCrabbe was entirely lacking in introspection or inquisitiveness, and was very greedy and gluttonous, eating at the feasts for longer than anyone and leaving with large loads of cakes to still be eaten. He could be described as enormously fat and pig-like, like [[Dudley Dursley]], but even more thuggish and stupid. Despite his large frame, Crabbe had a surprisingly soft voice, though he speaks so rarely that Harry never noted his tone of voice until Crabbe's last battle. Crabbe seemed to be incapable of independent thought; he was generally told what to do by [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]], and both he and [[Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] did so poorly in their O.W.L.s that they had to repeat their fifth year, further showcasing their low intelligence. Nonetheless, Crabbe was still depicted as slightly more intelligent than Goyle and in [[1996]] he seemed to quarrel with Malfoy for the first time, for a reward.\n\nSlytherins are typically described as \"cunning\", though given Crabbe and Goyle's demonstrated low intelligence, it is likely that they were sorted into Slytherin due to their desire for power and their belief in [[Blood status|blood purity]], which are often considered to be other common Slytherin traits. It is also possible that they did not fit into the other houses as well as they fit into Slytherin, or that they requested the [[Sorting Hat]] to specifically place them there as Harry and Hermione did for [[Gryffindor]].\n\nCrabbe also displayed poor sportsmanship as a Quidditch player, as when playing Beater for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]], he spitefully sent a Bludger at Harry after the Snitch had already been caught during the 1995-1996 Quidditch match between Slytherin and Gryffindor.\n\nNear the end of his life, Crabbe proved to be a deadly [[dark wizard]], being able to cast the [[Unforgivable Curses]] with clear talent. While he failed his [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] classes, he excelled in the actual [[Dark Arts (class)|Dark Arts class]], his thuggish sadism giving him the motivation to perform powerful curses on his fellow students and even becoming top of the class. He also seemed to change for the worse, as he defied Draco knowing that the [[Malfoy family]] had lost its influence and prestige in both the wizarding world and Voldemort's eyes, and that nothing could be gained from being affiliated with them anymore. Furthermore, he was not above torturing and even attempting to kill fellow students. Crabbe attempted to murder [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] for being a Muggle-born and blood traitor, respectively, also hurling the highly offensive \"Mudblood\" at the former. This differentiates him from Draco, who had realised in his sixth year that he had delved deeper into the [[Dark Arts]] than he wanted. However, Crabbe also remained reckless and stupid, and neglected the potency of the Dark Arts, releasing [[Fiendfyre|cursed flames]] to incinerate his opponents that he could not control, which led to his death.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n{{Quote|First time they've ever been top in anything, I expect.|Crabbe's and Gregory Goyle's affinity for the Cruciatus Curse|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Crabbe played Beater for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]]. He was chosen for his size and strength rather than skill.<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': By 1998, Crabbe was highly proficient with dark magic and [[dark charm]]s, such as the [[Cruciatus Curse]], the [[Killing Curse]] (two of the [[Unforgivable Curses]]), and could even summon [[Fiendfyre]]. However, when he released Fiendfyre in the [[Room of Requirement]] it resulted in his death, due to him not knowing how to stop it.<ref name=\"DH\"/>\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': Crabbe was a capable duellist.<ref name=\"HBPG\">{{HBP|G}}</ref> Crabbe would cover Goyle, when the two duelled [[Harry Potter]] on the latter's way to the [[Astronomy Tower]] and proved to be talented. After being taught by the Carrows, his skill in dark magic made him a deadly opponent and he proved capable of holding his own against [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. Fortunately, he missed both Hermione and Ron when he used the Killing Curse but his ability to successfully cast such a lethal spell at all cemented him as a deadly duellist.<ref name=\"DH\"/>\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Crabbe was able to perform the ''[[Descendo]]'' charm, which causes any targeted object to move downwards. He was also able to cast the [[Disillusionment Charm]] to disguise himself, showing he had a reasonable degree of skill in charm-work.<ref name=\"DH\"/> He could also cast the simple [[Wand-Lighting Charm]] successfully.<ref name=\"HBPG\"/>\n\n==Possessions==\n[[File:VincentCrabbeWandNN8228.jpg|thumb|Crabbe's wand]]\n*'''[[Vincent Crabbe's wand|Wand]]''': Crabbe owned a [[wand]], which was of an unknown length, [[wand wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] material. Like most British wizards, he presumably purchased it from [[Ollivanders]] in [[Diagon Alley]], [[London]], before starting his [[first year]] at Hogwarts in [[1991]]. By this [[seventh year]], Crabbe was capable of performing potent [[Dark Arts|dark magic]] with his wand, including the [[Unforgivable Curses]] and [[Fiendfyre]]. However, his wand was destroyed during the [[Skirmish at the Room of Requirement]] in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], when he lost control of his conjured Fiendfyre and subsequently perished in the flames, along with his wand.<ref name=\"DH\"/>\n*'''[[Potter Stinks badge]]''': During the [[1994\u20131995 school year]] when Hogwarts was hosting the [[Triwizard Tournament]], Crabbe owned and wore one of these derogatory enchanted badges to mock [[Harry Potter]] and his participation in the tournament.<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n*'''[[Shrunken head]]''': Crabbe owned a shrunken head, often a speaking object, in his luggage with him to Hogwarts for the [[1996\u20131997 school year]]. However, it was confiscated by the caretaker [[Argus Filch]], and the suspicion of it being a [[Dark Arts|dark]] object; it was most likely was indeed.<ref name=\"HBP\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n*Vincent means \"conqueror\" or \"victor.\"\n*His last name is probably a variation of [[crab]], a small, round crustacean with two large claws in front, or informal English for a grumpy person.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:CrabbeLEGOminifigure.jpg|thumb|Vincent Crabbe as a LEGO mini-figure]]\n[[File:CrabbeLEGOHP1-4.png|thumb|Vincent Crabbe in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]\n[[File:Crabbe LEGOY2.png|thumb|Vincent Crabbe in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]\n*Vincent Crabbe was portrayed in [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]] of the ''Harry Potter'' [[Harry Potter (book series)|series]] by [[Great Britain|British]] actor, [[Jamie Waylett]].\n*In the books, Crabbe is generally portrayed as being more intelligent than Goyle but in the films, it seems to be the other way around.\n*He is portrayed as a more comedic character in the films, the shorter and fatter of Malfoy's bodyguards, but as of the [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|fourth film]], he is the taller of Malfoy's henchmen. The more comedic punishments for the Slytherins' wrongdoing seem to go to him. In the fourth film, when Malfoy is turned into a ferret by Bartemius Crouch Jnr, masquerading as Mad-Eye Moody, the ferret is thrown into Crabbe's trousers, clawing away at his legs. Jamie Waylett who plays Crabbe had to wear two pairs of trousers so that the ferret would not cause any injury, earlier in the film the spider was thrown on to Crabbe's head and he groans out of disgust and fear. Indeed, in the film adaptation of the third novel, Harry is messing with Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle while under his invisibility cloak, under the pretence of being a vicious ghost, he pulls down Crabbe's trousers and kicks him on his backside when Crabbe tries and fails to pull them back up. Malfoy runs away screaming, and he pushes Crabbe down again, who is struggling to get to his feet and pull up his trousers. He eventually gets up and has to crawl away from the scene, trousers forgotten, and his underpants and legs showing. In the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|original novel]], Harry had thrown mud at the threesome and thrown a tree branch at Crabbe. This scene was relived somewhat in the fifth film, albeit that it was Fred and George Weasley who caused the mayhem. The fireworks set off by the Weasley twins target the Slytherin threesome. One particularly overambitious firework goes after Goyle, who pushes it away. It chases after Crabbe, who is running, yelling, away. The firework is ultimately too fast, and it shoves his backside, reminiscent of the kicking scene. In the second film, when the school is cheering for Rubeus Hagrid, Crabbe gets up to cheer, only to be pulled down by Malfoy, looking embarrassed. Another somewhat comedic portrayal of Crabbe is in the third film, in which Malfoy, Goyle, Pansy Parkinson, Pike and other Slytherins imitate Dementors with hoods and robes. Crabbe imitates a Dementor like the others, but has neither hood nor robe on, and therefore doesn't even slightly resemble a Dementor.\n*Crabbe does not appear in either part of the film adaptation of {{DH}}, and his role is taken by Goyle, who casts the Fiendfyre and dies in his place in {{DH|F2}}. Goyle's role in the book is replaced by [[Blaise Zabini]] in the film. This is because on [[7 April]] [[2009]] Crabbe's actor ([[Jamie Waylett]]) and another man [[Jamie Waylett#Legal issues|were arrested for cannabis possession]] and later tried and sentenced to community work. There is no mention of him or his fate in Part 2 (instead of Crabbe, Goyle is the one dying in the film) although it may be possible that in case he attended that year, he was sent to the [[Dungeons]] like [[Pansy Parkinson]], or evacuated to Hogsmeade along the underage students, or he died among several other Death Eaters. This was the same in the video game adaptation and {{LEGO|Y2}}.\n*In {{HBP|FA}}, Crabbe is seen in Slughorn's Potions class. However, it is stated in the book that Crabbe and Goyle failed to advance to N.E.W.T.-level potions.\n*Vincent Crabbe's LEGO mini-figure in set 4735 features Ronald Weasley's face on the flip side to show that it is actually Ron, disguised by Polyjuice Potion.<ref name=\"lhpcharacters\">{{LEGO|C}}, Page 53 (\"Vincent Crabbe: Undercover Gryffindor\")</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Vincent Crabbe}}\n*{{PS}} {{1st}}\n*{{PS|F}}\n*{{PS|G}}\n*{{COS}}\n*{{COS|F}}\n*{{COS|G}} {{Comment|Except in Xbox/Gamecube Version}}\n*{{POA}}\n*{{POA|F}}\n*{{POA|G}}\n*{{GOF}}\n*{{GOF|F}}\n*{{OOTP}}\n*{{OOTP|F}}\n*{{OOTP|G}}\n*{{HBP}}\n*{{HBP|F}}\n*{{HBP|G}}\n*{{DH}}\n*{{CC}} {{Mention}}\n*{{CC|P}} {{Mention}}\n*{{QWC}}\n*{{LEGO|C}} {{C|[[Ronald Weasley]], disguised via [[Polyjuice Potion]]}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}}\n*{{LEGO}}\n*{{PM}}\n*{{WW}}\n*{{TCG}}\n*{{HPV|CH}}\n*{{WU}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Draco's gang}}\n{{Death Eaters}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Crabbe, Vincent}}\n[[de:Vincent Crabbe]]\n[[es:Vincent Crabbe]]\n[[fr:Vincent Crabbe]]\n[[ru:\u0412\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u041a\u0440\u044d\u0431\u0431]]\n[[fi:Vincent Crabbe]]\n[[nl:Vincent Korzel]]\n[[pl:Vincent Crabbe]]\n[[ja:\u30d3\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30d6]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:Accidental deaths]]\n[[Category:Battle of Hogwarts fatalities]]\n[[Category:Beaters]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Crabbe family]]\n[[Category:Dark wizards]]\n[[Category:Death Eater allies]]\n[[Category:Deaths by fire]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Foundables]]\n[[Category:Horcrux destroyers]]\n[[Category:Impersonated individuals]]\n[[Category:Inquisitorial Squad]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Non-graduate Hogwarts students]]\n[[Category:Pure-blood supremacists]]\n[[Category:Pure-bloods]]\n[[Category:Skirmish at the Room of Requirement participants]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Slytherins Sorted in 1991]]\n[[Category:Unforgivable curse users]]"
