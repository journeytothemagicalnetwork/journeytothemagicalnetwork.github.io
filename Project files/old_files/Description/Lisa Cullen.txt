She competed in the school [[Exploding Snap]] tournament during the [[1996\u20131997 school year]].\n\n==Etymology==\n*Lisa means either \"Oath of God\" or \"God is satisfacton\" in Hebrew\n*Cullen means \"puppy or dog\" in Gaelic and \"holly\" in Irish\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*\"Cullen\" is also the surname of the main [[vampire]] clan in the popular ''Twilight'' series. [[Robert Pattinson]], who starred as male lead [[w:c:twilightsaga:Edward Cullen|Edward Cullen]] in the ''Twilight'' film adaptations, also played [[Cedric Diggory]] in {{GOF|FA}}. However, since Lisa Cullen first appeared in the PlayStation 2 version of the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|''Prisoner of Azkaban'' video game]], released in [[2004]], her surname would not be an homage to Edward Cullen, as the first ''Twilight'' book was released in [[2005]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{PS2 only}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogwarts Exploding Snap}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cullen, Lisa}}\n[[pl:Lisa Cullen]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
