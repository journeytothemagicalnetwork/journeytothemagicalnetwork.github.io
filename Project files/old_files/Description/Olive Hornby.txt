Because Professor Dippet asked me to look for you-|Olive finding Myrtle Warren's body|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\n'''Olive Hornby''' (fl. [[1940s]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who used to harass and bully [[Myrtle Warren]] about her glasses when they were school girls at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nOlive was born between [[1926]] and [[1932]], around the time [[Myrtle Warren|Myrtle]] was born. She also had a [[Olive Hornby's brother|brother]].\n\n===Hogwarts School===\nWhen she was eleven years old, Olive received a letter, accepting her into [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. It's unknown if she was older than or was the same age as [[Myrtle Warren|Myrtle]], so their [[Sorting ceremony|Sorting]] might have been at the same time or in different years.\n\n====Bullying Myrtle====\nOn one such occasion, Olive cruelly taunted Myrtle about her glasses, which was the reason Myrtle was in the bathroom that concealed the [[Chamber of Secrets]] on the [[13 June|night of her murder]].<ref name=\"COS16\">{{COS|B|16}}</ref> After realising that no one had seen [[Myrtle Warren|Myrtle]] for a couple of hours, and knowing that Olive Hornby had previously bullied Myrtle, Professor [[Armando Dippet]], then-[[Headmaster]] of Hogwarts, requested her to go and look for Myrtle. When Olive got to the bathroom, the first thing she saw was Myrtle's [[Death|dead]] body lying on the floor. This left Olive in a state of shock and horror, according to Myrtle's [[ghost]], who watched the scene with delight.<ref name=\"GOF25\">{{GOF|B|26}}</ref>\n\n===Haunted by Moaning Myrtle===\n[[Myrtle Warren|Moaning Myrtle]], as Myrtle's ghost was now known, haunted Olive Hornby for a long period of time, even after she left Hogwarts.<ref>If she was still at Hogwarts, Olive would force Moaning Myrtle to go away by calling the [[Headmaster]] or her parents, not the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].</ref> After Moaning Myrtle interrupted her [[Olive Hornby's brother|brother]]'s wedding, Olive went to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] to get rid of the troublesome ghost. [[Myrtle Warren]] was then sent back to [[Hogwarts Castle]], where she haunted the bathroom in which she died.<ref name=\"GOF25\">{{GOF|B|26}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nOlive Hornby was already [[Death|dead]] before the events surrounding the [[1994\u20131995 school year|1994-1995]] [[Triwizard Tournament]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], although it is unknown what year she actually died.<ref name=\"death\">From Moaning Myrtle's remark in {{GOF}} (emphasis added): \"''And then she saw my body...ooooh, she didn't forget that '''''until her dying day''''', I made sure of that...''\"</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n*The olive branch to the ancient Greeks, was sacred to Athena and was a sign of peace.\n*Her last name, ''Hornby'', is an Old Norse personal name composed of the elements ''horn'' \u2018horn' + ''bo\u00f0i'' \u2018messenger'. This could possibly point to the fact that Olive was most likely the first to send the message about Myrtle's death. Horns were also a symbol of power in many cultures, which could mean that Olive had power and authority over Myrtle. It might also be a \"Last Trump\" (in the sense of trumpet) reference.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{COS}} {{1st Mention}}\n*{{COS|F}} {{Mention}}\n*{{COS|G}} {{Mention}}\n*{{GOF}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Hornby, Olive}}\n\n[[de:Olive Hornby]]\n[[fr:Olive Hornby]]\n[[pl:Oliwia Hornby]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Deceased individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts students during the Riddle-era]]\n[[Category:Hornby family|Olive]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
