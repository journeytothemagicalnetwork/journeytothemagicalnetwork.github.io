Later that same term, she could be found in the [[Seventh-floor corridor|seventh floor corridor]], where she traded [[potion]]s for [[Wizard's Chess|chess]] pieces.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Daisy\" is from the English word for the white flower, ultimately derived from Old English ''d\u00e6geseage'' meaning \"day eye\". It was first used as a given name in the 19th century, at the same time many other plant and flower names were coined.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{PS2 only}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Corran, Daisy}}\n\n[[pl:Daisy Corran]]\n[[fr:Daisy Corran]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
