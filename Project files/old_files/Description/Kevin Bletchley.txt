He was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin]] and played as [[Keeper]] on the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]].<ref name=\"QWC\">{{QWC}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\"Kevin\" is the anglicised form of the Irish name ''Caoimh\u00edn'', derived from the older Irish ''C\u00f3emgein'', composed of the Old Irish elements ''c\u00f3em'' \"kind, gentle, handsome\" and ''gein'' \"birth\". Saint Caoimh\u00edn established a monastery in Glendalough, Ireland in the 6th century and is the patron saint of Dublin. It became popular in the English-speaking world outside of Ireland in the 20th century.\n\nBletchley is a small Market town (now situated within Milton Keynes) in Buckinghamshire - home of Bletchley Park, the enigma code breaking machine.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*It is very likely that Kevin Bletchley was actually intended to be [[Miles Bletchley]], the Slytherin Keeper from the novels and films, but it is also possible that Miles does not exist in [[Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup|this game]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{QWC}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bletchley, Kevin}}\n\n[[es:Kevin Bletchley]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0430\u0439\u043b\u0437 \u0411\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b\u0438]]\n[[pl:Kevin Bletchley]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:Bletchley family]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Green-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Keepers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
