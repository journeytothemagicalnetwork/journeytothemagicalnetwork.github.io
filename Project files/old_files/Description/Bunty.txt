Quote [[Eddie Redmayne]]: ''\"So, Victoria and I asked Jo what their history was. The next day, three pages of original J.K. Rowling text, now kept in my safe, was written about the depths of their friendship and where it had come from and how Bunty had come to the book signing and had been obsessed with Newt.\"''</ref> The two of them developed a friendship, and by September of that year Bunty had gotten a job as assistant of Newt.<ref name=\"COGS\"/>\n[[File:Newt and Bunty.jpeg|250px|thumb|right|Newt and Bunty in his [[9 Sherringford Square|house]]'s basement]]\nIn June 1927, Bunty was fully established as Newt's assistant, and helped him find some baby [[Niffler]]s who had escaped in his house. Upon Newt's decision to travel to [[Paris]] in search of [[Credence Barebone]], he left Bunty a note informing her of his travels, and asking her to look after his creatures in his absence.<ref name=\"COGS\">{{COG|S}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nBunty was clearly a compassionate young witch with a keen interest and passion in caring for [[magic]]al [[creature]]s as Newt Scamander's assistant. Newt Scamander regarded her to be a trustworthy and reliable individual, so much so he granted her permission to access his home to care for his many creatures whilst on his travels. Due to her enthusiasm and effort as Newt's assistant along with her passionate caring for his various [[beast]]s, it can be presumed she also held his passion and interest in [[Magizoology]] very highly.<ref name=\"COGS\"/> \n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': Bunty was very skilled in the caring and handling of various magical creatures, being very able to care for Newt's creatures as his assistant. In particular, she was shown handling and caring for several baby [[Niffler]]s very competently and carefully and was trusted by Newt to care for his larger and more dangerous beasts, showing she was accomplished in this field.<ref name=\"COGS\"/>  \n\n==Personal possessions==\n[[file:Bunty's wand.jpg|thumb|right|Bunty's wand]]\n*'''[[Wand]]''': Bunty owned a wand, which was of an unknown length, [[wand wood]] and [[wand core]] material.\n\n==Etymology==\n*The name \"Bunty\" has multiple origins and uses, mostly animal-related, including:\n*As a term of endearment that stems from a dialect name for lamb that means \"to butt.\"\n**Bunting is a form of animal behaviour, often found in cats, in which the animal butts or rubs their head against other things, including people. It is generally considered to be a form of territorial scent-marking behaviour, where the cat rubs the scent glands on their cheeks and forehead on the object being marked.\n*Stemming from the English and Scottish word ''buntin'', meaning \"plump.\"\n*The name Bunting is given to a group of Eurasian and African passerine birds of the family Emberizidae.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Bunty is played by [[Victoria Yeates]] in the [[Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald|second]] and [[Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore|third instalment]]s<ref name=\"imdb\">[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4021273/ Victoria Yeates IMDb]</ref>of the ''[[Fantastic Beasts (film series)|Fantastic Beasts]]'' film series.<ref name=\"pm\" />\n*Though Bunty's role in the film was minimal, [[J. K. Rowling]] devised a \"fully fleshed\" backstory for her (in a similar sentiment of what she disclosed about minor characters of the ''Harry Potter'' book series, such as [[Dean Thomas]], [[Theodore Nott]], and [[Filius Flitwick]]). Rowling provided [[Eddie Redmayne]] and Victoria Yeates three pages of original text about the origin of Bunty's relationship with Newt.<ref name=backstory/>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Bunty}}\n*{{COG|S}} {{1st}}\n*{{COG}}\n*{{SOD}}\n*{{AM}}\n*{{PM}} {{Mention}}\n*{{WW}} {{Mention}}\n*{{WU}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}[[es:Bunty]]\n[[de2:Bunty]]\n[[fr:Bunty]]\n[[pl:Bunty]]\n[[ru:\u0411\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Foundables]]\n[[Category:Personal assistants]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
