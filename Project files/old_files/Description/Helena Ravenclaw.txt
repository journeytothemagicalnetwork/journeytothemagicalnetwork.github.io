Also, while other ghosts are portrayed as blue or white, she is grey instead and shadows could be cast on her. She is also one of the few ghosts seen walking on the ground rather that simply flying.\n*The Grey Lady makes a notable appearance in the deleted scenes portion of the ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Chamber of Secrets]]'' DVD (when Harry is finding the secret of [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|Tom Riddle's Diary]], he asks her to leave, wanting privacy). It seems rather strange that the Ravenclaw ghost is allowed in Gryffindor Tower. However, being a ghost, she could go everywhere.\n*In {{DH|F2}} and {{LEGO|Y2}}, Helena has a friendship with [[Luna Lovegood]] which is not mentioned in the books.\n*In the last film, unlike the book, she remarks to Harry when asking about the Diadem that both he and Tom Riddle are strangely similar in some aspects of their personality.\n*While working on the earliest drafts for the books, [[J. K. Rowling]] had originally named her the \"Whispering Lady\".<ref name=\"pottermoreghosts\">{{WW|hogwarts-ghosts}}</ref>\n*There are a number of Grey Lady ghost stories of Great Britain, and it is thought that they might have been an inspiration for this character.\n*The Grey Lady is the only house ghost whose nickname is not alliterative. This is perhaps a little ironic, as most Ravenclaws have alliterative names.\n*Helena was the only house ghost whose name, even nickname, was not revealed in the first book, though she appears in it.\n**In the last film, when Harry addresses her as the Grey Lady, she mentions that she doesn't listen to that name, perhaps indicating she doesn't like it. In the books and {{PM}}, both Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington and Robert Hillard introduced her to others as the Grey Lady, though not in her presence.\n*[[J. K. Rowling]] has stated that The Grey Lady appeared very briefly in {{PS}}. It is believed this passage refers to her: \"''Harry and Ron passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else''\". No other unexplained mention of a ghost is found in the book, so it can be presumed this is the Grey Lady. Likewise, in {{HBP}}, a reference of a \"''ghost of a long-haired woman ''[who]'' drifted serenely past''\" fits almost perfectly with the description of the Grey Lady in {{DH}}.\n*A ghost woman with long brown hair passes through the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] classroom during [[Quirinus Quirrell]]'s [[Knockback Jinx]] lesson in the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (PC, Mac)|PC version of the first video game]], which is possibly the Grey Lady.\n*In the [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (video game)|PC version game]] of {{GOF}}, the Grey Lady appears in the [[Clock Tower]].\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Helena Ravenclaw}}\n[[File:GreyLadyWU.png|120px|thumb|Helena Ravenclaw as she appears in {{WU}}]]\n*{{PS}} {{1st}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{PS|F}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{PS|G}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{COS|F}} {{Ghost}} {{Comment|Deleted scene}}\n*{{GOF|G}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{OOTP|G}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{HBP}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{DH}} {{Ghost}} {{1stID}}\n*{{DH|F2}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{DH|G2}} {{Mention}}\n*{{PM}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{WW}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{HPFW}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{HPV|CH}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{HM}} {{Ghost}} \n*{{WU}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{MA}} {{Ghost}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Hogwarts third floor}}\n{{Hogwarts}}\n{{Order of the Phoenix}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ravenclaw, Helena}}\n\n[[de:Graue Dame]]\n[[fr:Dame Grise]]\n[[it:Helena Corvonero]]\n[[ru:\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0430\u043c\u0430]]\n[[fi:Helena Korpinkynsi]]\n[[pl:Helena Ravenclaw]]\n[[es:Helena Ravenclaw]]\n[[no:Helena Ravnklo]]\n[[ja:\u30d8\u30ec\u30ca\u30fb\u30ec\u30a4\u30d6\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30fc]]\n[[Category:11th century deaths]]\n[[Category:Articles related to Horcruxes]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Deaths by stabbing]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Foundables]]\n[[Category:Ghosts]]\n[[Category:Historical figures]]\n[[Category:Killed by Bloody Baron]]\n[[Category:Murder victims]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Order of the Phoenix allies]]\n[[Category:Portraits]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaw family]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
