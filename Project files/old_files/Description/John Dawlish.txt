Noted by [[Albus Dumbledore]] as an \"excellent [[Auror]]\", he accompanied [[Minister for Magic]] [[Cornelius Fudge]] on assignments, and also worked under Ministers [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] and [[Pius Thicknesse]].

Dawlish! Shacklebolt! Take him!|Cornelius Fudge orders [[Auror]]s to seize Albus Dumbledore|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n[[File:Kingsleywithfudge.JPG|236x236px|thumb|left|John Dawlish with Dolores Umbridge, Cornelius Fudge, and Kingsley Shacklebolt in Dumbledore's office]]\n\nOn [[20 April]], [[1996]], after [[Marietta Edgecombe]] denounced the illegal [[Dumbledore's Army]] to [[Dolores Umbridge]], Minister [[Cornelius Fudge]] travelled to [[Hogwarts Castle]] in an attempt to expel [[Harry Potter]], who was leading the outlawed student group. [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] and John Dawlish escorted the Minister there, and were positioned on either side of the door to the [[Headmaster's office]].<ref name=\"OP27\" />\n\nHeadmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] took the blame instead, with a false confession. After Fudge accused him of treason and sedition against himself and the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], Fudge made a small choking noise, and then looked round at Kingsley and Dawlish. Dawlish nodded reassuringly and moved forwards, his hand drifting towards the wand in his pocket. Dumbledore warned him not to be foolish, saying that he would have to hurt Dawlish if he attacked him, and the [[Auror]] blinked rather foolishly, without a clue as to what to do next. Fudge ordered the Aurors to seize Dumbledore, but the [[Headmaster]] easily defeated the Ministry officials, leaving Fudge, Umbridge, Kingsley and Dawlish unconscious on the floor as he escaped. Dawlish was the first to come to, stirring on the floor. When the wizards noted Dumbledore's absence, Dawlish fruitlessly tried to intercept him by wrenching the door to the office open and disappearing down the stairs, followed closely by Kingsley and Umbridge.<ref name=\"OP27\" />\n\n[[File:Auror Dawlish, Cornelius Fudge and Percy Weasley.JPG|250x250px|thumb|Dawlish alongside Cornelius Fudge and [[Percy Weasley]], after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]\nIn the early minutes of [[17 June]], just after midnight, Dawlish was among the number of Ministry officials who, led by Umbridge, attacked [[Rubeus Hagrid]] in order to arrest him and sack him from his positions of [[Keeper of Keys and Grounds|Gamekeeper]] and [[Professor]]. While trying to [[Stunning Spell|stun]] him, Dawlish pleaded Hagrid to \"be reasonable\". It is unclear whether Dawlish was one of the Aurors physically knocked-out by Hagrid, or the one who, like Umbridge, was left unharmed, but tripped over one of his unconscious colleagues and fell over. In th course of the battle, Dawlish and his colleagues were also responsible for the near-fatal injury of [[Minerva McGonagall]] as she came running from the castle to try and prevent the attack on Hagrid, hitting her with four simultaneous Stunning Spells that resulted in her being committed to St. Mungo's for treatment.<ref name=\"OP31\">{{OOTP|B|31}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], Dawlish was one of the Aurors who arrived with Cornelius Fudge into the [[Atrium|Ministry Atrium]]. Fudge sent Dawlish and [[Williamson]] down to the [[Department of Mysteries]] to see if there were, as Albus Dumbledore told him, escaped [[Death Eaters]] in the [[Death Chamber]], bound by an [[Anti-Disapparation Jinx]].<ref name=\"OP36\">{{OOTP|B|36}}</ref>\n\n===Second Wizarding War===\n\n====Under Minister Rufus Scrimgeour====\n{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you're not at Hogwarts.|Albus Dumbledore|Yes, he is very nosy about that.

I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret.|Dawlish was ordered by the Minister to tail Dumbledore|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\nWhen [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] succeeded [[Cornelius Fudge]] as [[Minister for Magic]], due to his failure to announce the return of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], a number of [[Auror]]s were stationed at [[Hogsmeade]] to provide [[Hogwarts Castle]] extra protection. Dawlish was among these Aurors, as were [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Proudfoot]] and [[Savage]].<ref name=\"HBP8\">{{HBP|B|8}}</ref>\n\nIntrigued by [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s activities outside [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|his school]], [[Minister for Magic|Minister]] [[Rufus Scrimgeour|Scrimgeour]] assigned Dawlish to follow Dumbledore, but the Headmaster was forced to jinx him once more.<ref name=\"HBP17\">{{HBP|B|17}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of [[1997]], Dawlish was put into the [[Confundus Charm]] by someone in the [[Order of the Phoenix]], in order to provide the [[Death Eaters]] with a false trail as to when [[Harry Potter]] would depart from [[4 Privet Drive]]. Sure enough, [[Corban Yaxley|Yaxley]] extracted information from him, and he told him that he would be moved on [[30 July]], escorted by an entire party of [[Auror]]s. [[Severus Snape]], however, knew this was a false trail (even noting that Dawlish was especially susceptible to the Confundus Charm) and told Voldemort the [[Order of the Phoenix]] would move Harry on [[27 July]].<ref name=\"DH1\">{{DH|B|1}}</ref>\n\n====Under Minister Pius Thicknesse====\n{{Quote|But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago.

Anyway, Dawlish is still in St Mungo's and Gran's on the run.|Dawlish was no match for Augusta Longbottom|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\nOn [[1 August]], [[1997]] the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] was [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|taken over]] by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Death Eaters]]<ref name=\"DH8\">{{DH|B|8}}</ref> as [[Minister for Magic|Minister]] [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] was killed and replaced by [[Pius Thicknesse]], who was under the [[Imperius Curse]].<ref name=\"DH11\">{{DH|B|11}}</ref>\n\nDawlish continued to serve as [[Auror]] under the new regime, helping in the imprisonment of [[Muggle-born]]s and assisting the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]-controlled Ministry. He was charged with transporting [[Muggle-born]] [[wizardkind|wizards]] tried by the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]] to [[Azkaban]].<ref name=\"DH15\">{{DH|B|15}}</ref>\n\nStill under the effects of the [[Confundus Charm]], Dawlish was [[Stunning Spell|Stunned]] by [[Dirk Cresswell]] halfway on their flight to [[Azkaban]]. Cresswell was not sure if he was left alright, but took [[John Dawlish's broomstick|Dawlish's broomstick]] and went on the run.<ref name=\"DH15\" />\n\nWhen [[Neville Longbottom]] stepped over the line in rebelling against [[Alecto Carrow|Alecto]] and [[Amycus Carrow]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], Dawlish was sent to take [[Augusta Longbottom]] as a hostage to get Neville to cooperate with the new regime. However, the Ministry had heavily underestimated Augusta, and she caused him sufficient injury to merit admittance into [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]].<ref name=\"DH29\">{{DH|B|29}}</ref>\n\n===Later life===\nWhat happened to Dawlish after the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] is unknown. It is possible that he was arrested and tried for complying with the Death Eaters and for crimes against Muggle-borns, and if he were found guilty, he would have been sentenced to a term of unknown length in Azkaban.\n\nHowever, a [[Confundus Charm]] had been placed on John Dawlish the previous July, and he continued to act \"not quite right\" for some time thereafter; it is possible that he was not loyal to Voldemort's Ministry of his own volition, in which case charges against him would have been dismissed. Whether Dawlish continued to work for the Ministry, as an Auror or otherwise, cannot be determined.\n\n==Physical appearance==\nDawlish was described as looking very capable and self-assured, a \"tough-looking wizard\" with \"very short, wiry\" grey hair.<ref name=\"hair\" /> When hesitant or unsure of himself, he would blink and look \"rather foolish\".<ref name=\"OP27\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nJohn Dawlish was a dedicated individual, performing exceptionally well at school and passing the stringent requirements to become an Auror. By the [[1990s]], he served under [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] and accompanied the [[Minister for Magic]] himself. Even [[Albus Dumbledore]] himself voiced his belief that John Dawish was an excellent Auror.<ref name=\"OP27\" />\n\nDawlish served the Ministry and appeared willing to execute more or less any order handed to him by higher-ranking officals, even when such course of action was morally questionable, such as the [[Ousting of Rubeus Hagrid|attack]] on [[Rubeus Hagrid]] and [[Minerva McGonagall]] on the behest of [[Dolores Umbridge]] in [[1996]], or his work following the [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|Death Eater take-over of the Ministry]] when he was tasked with capturing [[Muggle-born]]s<ref name=\"DH15\" /> and with attacking [[Augusta Longbottom]],<ref name=\"DH29\" /> which he attempted without protest.\n\nHe was unflappable during conflicts and remained calm and generally unfazed by threats from his criminal enemies and intrepidly confront them when such a course of action was necessary \u2014 this was particularly evident during the Ministry's attempt to arrest [[Albus Dumbledore]] in [[1996]], when not only did he not hesitate in stepping forward to challenge him single-handedly with the intent of arresting him (when Dumbledore's presence alone was enough to make several [[Death Eaters]] flee in fear),<ref name=\"OP35\">{{OOTP|B|35}}</ref> but he also showed no sign of reluctance in attempting to pursue him upon the Professor's escape when he believed it was still possible to catch him.<ref name=\"OP27\" />\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Magic]]al mastery''': John Dawlish was a wizard of considerable ability, excelling in his studies and ultimately achieving an impressive academic record by earning top marks on all of his [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.s]]. Sometime after his graduation from Hogwarts, he went on to become an [[Auror]], which by all accounts served as a further testament of the fact that he was an unusually accomplished wizard, as only the best and brightest could ever have passed the highly demanding training programme. As an official [[Dark Wizard]] catcher, he was more than proficient in at least [[Potions (class)|Potions]], [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]], [[Herbology]], and [[Charms (class)|Charms]],<ref name=\"OP29\">{{OOTP|B|29}}</ref> as well as a very capable investigator [[Auror training|trained extensively]] in specialised areas such as [[Concealment and Disguise]] and [[Stealth and Tracking]].\n*'''[[Auror]] skills''': By the mid-[[1990s]], Dawlish was regarded as an excellent Auror. Ultimately, he proved to be reputable enough to perform assignments of great responsibility: he served as bodyguard on at least one occasion to [[Minister for Magic]] [[Cornelius Fudge]], he was stationed in the village of [[Hogsmeade]] to guard [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from potential [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] attacks during the height of the [[Second Wizarding War]], and he was sent to tail [[Albus Dumbledore]] when he was under suspicion by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].\n*'''[[Martial magic]]''': As a professional Dark Wizard catcher, Dawlish's ability in combative magic was considerable, but by the height of the [[Second Wizarding War]], a combination of unfamiliar situations, far superior opponents, sheer bad luck, and [[Confundus Charm]]s effectively meant that Dawlish was prevented from exercising the full extent of his skill. His two encounters with [[Albus Dumbledore]] aside, both of which predictably enough ended in him being easily defeated, even when Dumbledore had already maimed his hand, which was also attributable to Dumbledore knowing and thus effectively exploiting Dawlish's weaknesses,<ref name=\"OP27\"/> the rest of his subsequent failures came about from various unforeseen factors rather than any actual ineptitude on Dawlish's part: during the attempted dismissal of [[Rubeus Hagrid]] from Hogwarts, the magical resistance that came with Hagrid being a [[Half-Giant]], made the task significantly more difficult;<ref name=\"OP31\"/> when he was knocked unconscious by [[Dirk Cresswell]] while he transporting the former to Azkaban, Cresswell himself attributed his escape to Dawlish having been [[Confundus Charm|Confunded]] beforehand; by the time he was sent to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]] by [[Augusta Longbottom]], he had been the \"favourite punching-bag\" of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] for some time and was somewhat \"punch-drunk\", in addition to being often put under the effects of the [[Confundus Charm]].\n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Dawlish was also shown be a competent [[broomstick]] flyer, as whilst working for the corrupt [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]], he transported falsely convicted [[Muggle-born]] individuals to the prison [[Azkaban]] via broomstick flight, meaning he was accomplished with this method of [[Magical transportation|wizarding transportation]].<ref name=\"DH15\"/>\n\n==Possessions==\n*'''[[Wand]]''': Dawlish owned a wand, which was of unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] material. He used his wand in his career as an Auror.<ref name=\"OP27\"/><ref name=\"OP31\"/>\n*'''[[John Dawlish's broomstick|Broomstick]]''': John Dawlish owned his own [[broomstick]], which was of an unknown make and brand, to transport Muggle-borns to Azkaban via broomstick flight. However, he was [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] and had his broomstick stolen from him by [[Dirk Cresswell]], who subsequently escaped and took it with him instead.<ref name=\"DH15\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"John\" is the English form of ''Iohannes'', the Latin form of the Greek name \u0399\u03c9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 (''Ioannes''), itself derived from the Hebrew name \u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05d7\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05df (''Yochanan'') meaning \"Yahweh is gracious\".\n\n\"{{wplink|Dawlish}}\" is the name of a seaside town in Devon.
