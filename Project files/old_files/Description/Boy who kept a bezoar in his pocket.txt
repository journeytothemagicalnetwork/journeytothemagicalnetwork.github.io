Shortly before his first [[Potions (class)|Potions]] class, he commented on [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]'s unpleasant demeanour: \"''Snape always looks like he smells something bad''\". He did not complete Snape's assignment of gathering all the ingredients for the [[Wiggenweld Potion]] (only [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] managed to procure [[Wiggentree bark]]) \u2014 at one point, he expressed his wish that someone made an Instant Wiggenweld Potion mix, given the difficulty of gathering all the required ingredients.<ref name=\"PSgba\"/>\n\n{{Quote|My brother told me if you take off fast enough, you can look back and see the top of your head.|Shortly before his first [[Flying (class)|Flying]] lesson.|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}\nBefore the [[first year|first-years']] first [[Flying (class)|Flying]] lesson, he spent some time chatting about it in the [[Dungeons]].
