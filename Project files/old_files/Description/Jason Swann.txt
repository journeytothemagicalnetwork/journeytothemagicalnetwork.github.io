Jason was the one who gave [[Harry Potter]] a [[Folio Universitas]] that year. After Harry beat the [[Gobstones]] challenges, Jason gave him some [[Chocolate Frog Card]]s.<ref name=\"HBPG\">{{HBP|G}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Jason\" comes from the Greek name ''\u0399\u03b1\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd'' (Iason), which was derived from Greek ''\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9'' (iasthai) \"to heal\". In Greek mythology Jason was the leader of the Argonauts. After his uncle Pelias overthrew his father as king of Iolcos, Jason went in search of the Golden Fleece in order to win back the throne. During his journeys he married the sorceress Medea, who helped him gain the fleece and kill his uncle, but who later turned against him when he fell in love with another woman.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*This particular student was only featured in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|console versions]] of {{POA}} and the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|Nintendo DS version]] of {{HBP}}.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{1st}} {{C|Console versions}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Hogwarts Gobstones}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Swann, Jason}}\n[[fr:Jason Swann]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:Blue-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Gobstones players]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
