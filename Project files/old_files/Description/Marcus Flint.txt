But in {{POA|B|9}} (that was set in the [[1993\u20131994 school year]]), he was still attending the school when he should have graduated the year prior in the [[1992\u20131993 school year]]. [[J. K. Rowling]], when asked in [http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0200-scholastic-chat.htm|an interview] from February 2000,  originally corrected the error by just saying that he had to take the year again. However, she then had the error corrected in the present version of {{PS}} to say that Flint was a fifth-year in the [[1991\u20131992 school year]]. From that, it can be worked out that he started Hogwarts in September 1987, graduated in 1994 and was born in Sep 1975 to Aug 1976.</ref> <br/>[[Great Britain]]<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0700-swns-alfie.htm World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling]</ref>\n|died = \n|blood = [[Pure-blood]] or [[half-blood]] (possibly)<ref name=\"blood\">His family appears in the ''[[Pure-Blood Directory]]'', meaning that as of the 1930s it included no Muggles or Muggle-borns.

[[1975]]/[[1976]])<ref name=\"DOB\" /> was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1987]] to [[1994]] and was sorted into [[Slytherin]] house. He was a [[Chaser]] on the Slytherin [[Quidditch]] [[Slytherin Quidditch team|team]], as well as its Captain from at least [[1991]] to [[1994]]. \n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nMarcus was born in September [[1975]] to August [[1976]]<ref name=\"DOB\" /> in [[Great Britain]]. He was a descendant of the [[pure-blood]] [[Flint family]] and perhaps related in some way to former [[Minister for Magic]], [[Josephina Flint]] and [[Ursula Flint|Ursula Black]] (n\u00e9e Flint). It is unknown if Marcus himself was a pure-blood.\n\n===Hogwarts years (1987-1994)===\n====Early years====\n[[File:Slytherin team.jpg|250px|thumb|Marcus and other Slytherins playing a game of Quidditch]]\nFlint began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1987]]<ref name=\"DOB\" /> and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Slytherin]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]]. He lived in a dormitory in the [[Slytherin Dungeon]], and his [[Head of House]] was the [[Potions Master]], [[Professor]] [[Severus Snape]].\n\nAt some point, he joined the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] as a [[Chaser]] and became its [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|captain]] by his [[fifth year]]. Flint was known for being very rough and often brutal in his Quidditch-playing; for example, his handshakes with [[Gryffindor]] Captain and rival [[Oliver Wood]] often turned into attempts to break one another's fingers. He was also not above committing fouls, blocking [[Harry Potter]] in a [[1991]] Quidditch match.<ref name=\"PS11\">{{PS|B|11}}</ref>\n\n====Sixth year====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Oliver Wood|I don't believe it! Where you think you're going, Flint?|Flint|Quidditch practice! |I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.|Marcus and Oliver Wood argue over the Hogwarts' Quidditch pitch|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets }}\n[[File:Slytherin Quidditch team.jpg|250x250px|thumb|Marcus and the Slytherin Quidditch team antagonising Gryffindor]]\nIn [[1992]], Flint was pleased when his team received [[Nimbus 2001|new broomsticks]], courtesy of [[Lucius Malfoy]], when his son [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] became the team's new [[Seeker]]. They bragged to the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] about this and mocked their rivals' older brooms. This prompted [[Hermione Granger]] to insult Draco, remarking that \"''at least no one on the Gryffindor team had to ''buy'' their way in''\". Draco retaliated by calling Hermione a \"''filthy little [[Mudblood]]''\" to the outrage of the Gryffindors. Flint had to stand in front of Draco to prevent [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] from attacking and injuring his Seeker. [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] then attempted to [[Slug-Vomiting Charm|curse]] Draco, but it backfired, and the entire Slytherin team laughed uproariously as Ron vomited [[slug]]s.<ref name=\"CS7\">{{COS|B|7}}</ref> \n\nFlint was angered by Draco's stupidity during a match against Gryffindor. He reprimanded him after the game because Draco failed to notice the [[Golden Snitch]] next to him, causing Slytherin to lose the match. This was witnessed by George Weasley.<ref name=\"COS10\">{{COS|B|10}}</ref>\n\n====Seventh year====\n[[File:Marcus Flint and other Slytherins.jpg|227x227px|thumb|left|Marcus at Hogwarts]]\n{{Quote|Sorry! Sorry, didn't see her!|Flint audaciously defending his foul play|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}\nDuring Flint's final year, he participated in a scheme to scare Harry Potter with Draco, [[Vincent Crabbe]], and [[Gregory Goyle]]. The four Slytherins dressed up as [[Dementor]]s, which were guarding Hogwarts that year due to [[Sirius Black]]'s escape from [[Azkaban]].<ref name=\"POA13\">{{POA|B|13}}</ref> Following their cruel prank, [[Professor]] [[Minerva McGonagall]] took fifty [[House points]] from [[Slytherin]] and sentenced all four of them to detention as punishment. During the Quidditch final between Gryffindor and Slytherin [[1993\u20131994 school year|that year]], Flint played unscrupulously yet again against the rival team, smashing into [[Angelina Johnson]] with his broom, which resulted in [[Fred Weasley]] throwing his [[Beater's bat]] at his head, smashing his nose against his broom handle and causing it to bleed. Flint later managed during the game to score a goal against Gryffindor, but Harry caught the [[Golden Snitch]], allowing Gryffindor to win the game and to gain the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]] at last.<ref name=\"POA15\">{{POA|B|15}}</ref>\n\n===Later Life===\nIt is unknown what happened to Flint after he graduated Hogwarts and what his status was during the [[Second Wizarding War]].\n\nDuring the 2010s, Flint's younger self appeared as a [[Foundable]] during the [[Calamity]], clad in his Slytherin Quidditch uniform and entrapped by a magical [[fire]] [[Confoundable]]. Volunteer members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] were able to free him by casting the [[Water-Making Spell]], allowing Flint to return to his original time.<ref name=\"WU\">{{WU}}</ref>\n\n==Physical appearance==\n{{Quote|[[Harry Potter|Harry]] thought Flint looked as if he had some [[troll]] [[blood]] in him.|Harry's description of Marcus Flint|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}\n[[File:Flint.png|thumb|Flint's unappealing physical appearance]]\nMarcus was described as being tall and relatively muscular. [[Harry Potter]] also mentioned that he looked like he might have [[troll]] [[blood]] in him.<ref name=\"PS11\"/> However, this may simply have been an insult toward Flint's appearance.\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|'Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you', [[Rolanda Hooch|she]] said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year.|Rolanda Hooch's observation of Flint's cheating.|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}\n\nFlint did not follow good sportsmanship when playing [[Quidditch]], despite his position as [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] of his [[Slytherin Quidditch team|team]]. He allowed [[Draco Malfoy]] to join the team when bribed with the new [[Nimbus 2001]] [[broomstick]]s.<ref name=\"CS7\"/> Flint also resorted frequently to foul play, such as blocking [[Harry Potter]] in [[1991]]<ref name=\"PS11\"/> and trying to scare him by disguising as a [[Dementor]] in [[1993]].<ref name=\"POA13\"/> He seemed to find the misfortunes of others amusing as he laughed when Ron's [[Slug-vomiting Charm]] backfired on himself.<ref name=\"CS7\"/> When Draco failed to notice the [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]] floating above his head, leading the team to lose, Flint yelled at the new [[Seeker]] rather harshly for his foolishness.<ref name=\"COS10\"/> It was unknown how he viewed the importance of [[blood status]], though he seemed to approve of when Draco called [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] a [[mudblood]] and even defended him from harm afterwards, implying he may have held some prejudice towards [[Muggle-born]]s or that he was a [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood supremacist]], similar to many other Slytherin students.<ref name=\"CS7\"/>\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Marcus played as a [[Chaser]] on the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]]. He was the [[Captain]] from at least his fifth year to his seventh year, demonstrating he was an accomplished and skilled [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player, despite his frequent cheating and foul play on the Quidditch pitch.<ref name=\"PS11\"/><ref name=\"POA15\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n*The name Marcus is derived from Mars, the god of war in Roman mythology. This may allude to Flint's aggression. It is interestingly the opposite of [[Oliver Wood]]'s name, which means \"olive tree\", ultimately symbolising Wood's peaceful nature. \n*A flint is a stone used for lighting a [[fire]]. Once again, this alludes to his relationship with Oliver Wood; flint is kindling fire, and wood burns when in contact with fire.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Marcus.jpg|thumb|right|Marcus as a LEGO minifigure (first edition)]]\n[[File:MarcusFlintLEGOM.jpg|thumb|Marcus Flint as a LEGO mini-figure (second edition)]]\n*Flint was originally stated to be a [[Sixth year|sixth-year]] in {{PS}}, yet he was still at the school in {{POA}} (two years after his debut). [[J. K. Rowling]] explained this by saying that he had to repeat his last year because he failed his exams the first time round.<ref name=\"accio\">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0200-scholastic-chat.htm Online chat transcript, Scholastic.com, 3 February 2000]</ref><ref name=\"Official Site\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20060316221309/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=16 F.A.Q.] from {{JKRS}} (via the [https://web.archive.org/ Internet Archive])</ref> This explanation did not deter some fans from noticing other consistency errors with Flint's schooling years. However, in later editions of {{PS}}, Flint is stated to be a [[fifth year]], presumably to clear confusion and the need for a repeated year.\n*Flint was portrayed by [[Jamie Yeates]] in [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|the first]] film while the role was incorrectly credited to [[Will Theakston]], who played [[Terence Higgs]]. Yeates reprised the role and was credited correctly in the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|second]] film. He wore false teeth in both films.\n*Flint once borrowed {{QTA|R}} from the [[Hogwarts Library]] and was due to return the book on [[22 June]].\n*If [[Stanley Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]] attended Hogwarts, he would have been in the same year as Marcus Flint.{{cn}}\n*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, Marcus Flint is the [[Slytherin Quidditch team|Slytherin team]]'s [[Seeker]].\n*He was referred to as \"Captain Flint\" because he was captain of the Slytherin Quidditch Team. This may be an allusion to the [[wikipedia:Captain Flint|similarly-named captain]] of the pirate ship ''Walrus'' from [[wikipedia:Robert Louis Stevenson|Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s novel ''[[wikipedia:Treasure Island|Treasure Island]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Marcus Flint}}\n[[File:MarcusFlintLEGOHP1-4.png|thumb|Marcus Flint in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]\n*{{PS}} {{1st}}\n*{{PS|F}}\n*{{COS}}\n*{{COS|F}}\n*{{COS|G}}<ref>Although Flint is never identified, the complete [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] appeared in the game adaptation.</ref>\n*{{POA}}\n*{{POA|G}} {{Mention}}\n*{{QTA|E}}\n*{{QWC}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}}\n*{{LEGO|B}}\n*{{LEGO|C}}\n*{{LEGO}}\n*{{TCG}}\n*{{HPV|CH}}\n*{{WU}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|predecessor=unknown, eventually [[Lucinda Talkalot]]\n|position=[[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] of the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]]\n|years=[[1991]]-[[1994]]\n|successor=[[Graham Montague]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flint, Marcus}}\n[[de:Marcus Flint]]\n[[de2:Marcus Flint]]\n[[es:Marcus Flint]]\n[[fr:Marcus Flint]]\n[[it:Marcus Flint]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0441 \u0424\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0442]]\n[[pl:Marcus Flint]]\n[[Category:1970s births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Chasers]]\n[[Category:Flint family]]\n[[Category:Foundables]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts Quidditch Captains]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1987]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
