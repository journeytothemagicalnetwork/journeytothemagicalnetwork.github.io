Grim was born in late 1984 or early to mid 1985.</ref>\n\nShe began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] sometime in the early-to-mid [[1990s]] and was sorted into [[Slytherin]]. In her [[fifth year]], she became a [[prefect]].<ref name=\"WU\" />\n\nDuring the [[Second Wizarding War]], her parents were both outspoken supporters of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Magic is Might]] Campaign; following the war, her mother was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for involving herself in the conflict. Before she was imprisoned, the last thing her mother gave her was a [[Comet 290]] [[broomstick]], which Penelope regarded as the only thing she had left to remember her by.<ref name=\"WU\" />\n\n===Career and marriage===\nAfter her graduation, Penelope joined the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] at the [[British Ministry of Magic]].<ref name=\"WU\" /> She was described as being ambitious, a characteristic trait amongst Slytherins.<ref name=\"GF background\">{{WU}} (see [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-2-grim-fawley-background this])</ref> However, people were suspicious of her due to her parents' past support of Lord Voldemort. In particular, [[Gethsemane Prickle]] sent a [[Interdepartmental memo|memo]] to [[Harry Potter]], the Head of the [[Auror Office]], warning him about Penelope and predicting that she was going to be trouble.<ref name=\"WU\" />\n\nPenelope was given a desk job that left her in frequent contact with Grim Fawley, a research assistant in the department. Eventually, the two fell in [[love]] and started dating in [[2005]]. Fearing that discovery of their workplace romance would result in Grim being transferred out of the department, the two decided to keep their relationship secret.<ref name=\"GF background\" /><ref name=\"GF ministry record\">{{WU}} (see [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-2-ministry-record-grim-fawley this])</ref> As a result, the two would often communicate using coded messages.<ref name=\"WU\" />\n\nPenelope excelled in her work and her accomplishments within the Department resulted in her becoming an [[Auror]] within two years of having joined the department. She was described by Harry Potter as \"one of the finest candidates\" he had ever seen. During her career, Penelope was noted to not have been a rule follower, instead preferring to do things her own way. However, this view was common among Aurors and her work was otherwise considered outstanding. She was also noted for being very secretive.<ref name=\"WU\" />\n\nPenelope became friends with Harry and the two frequently talked about [[quidditch]] in the office, with her in particular being a huge fan of the [[Pride of Portree]]. During field work, Penelope favoured travelling with her broom instead of [[Apparition|Apparating]], which she attributed to her motion sickness.<ref name=\"WU\" />\n\nEventually, after having dated for a year, Penelope and Grim revealed their relationship. Although it was considered a bit scandalous, it was ultimately permitted. The two got [[Marriage|married]] in [[June]], [[2006]], on a Sunday in West Bromwich.<ref name=\"GF background\" /> At some point over the next nine years, before Penelope's disappearance in 2015, she and Grim would have twins<ref>In ''Wizards Unite'', Constance says \"and ''then'' they had two children\", with the phrasing implying they're twins.</ref> Addison<ref name=\"son\">{{See image|File:Talbot to Addison.jpeg}}</ref> and Melody<ref>[https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/foundable/grims-grief A part of Grim\u2019s journal reveals the names of his two children.]</ref>; Melody would inherit Penelope\u2019s nose and, despite her words to the contrary, Addison would inherit Penelope\u2019s stubbornness.\n\n==Possessions==\n*'''[[Comet 290]]''': She owned this [[broomstick]] before she was married as it was inscribed with her maiden name Padgett.<ref name=\"WU\" />\n*'''[[Slytherin]] [[Prefect badge]]''': She owned a tarnished Slytherin Prefect badge, as she was herself appointed as a Prefect during her later Hogwarts years.<ref name=\"WU\" />\n*'''[[Slytherin]] [[House scarf|scarf]]''': She also owned a scarf of the Slytherin colours.<ref>{{WU}} ([https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/location/grim-fawley-motives see website])</ref>\n*'''[[Penelope Fawley's wand|Wand]]''': [[Willow]], 12\u00bd inches, [[Dragon heartstring|Dragon Heartstring]] [[Wand core|core]], with a large spindling crack down the middle.<ref>{{WU}} ([https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/location/grim-fawley-motives see website])</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WU}} {{1st Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Ministry Level 2 employees}}\n{{character-stub}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fawley, Penelope}}\n[[Category:Auror Office personnel]]\n[[Category:Aurors]]\n[[Category:British individuals]]\n[[Category:Fawley family|Penelope]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts prefects]]\n[[Category:London Five]]\n[[Category:Married individuals]]\n[[Category:Padgett family]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Pride of Portree supporters]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
