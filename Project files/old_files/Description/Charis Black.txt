As revealed in ''[[Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies]]'', Chapter 3 (Horace Slughorn), Slughorn had \"completed half a century of service\" at the time of his retirement in [[1981]], meaning he started teaching there circa [[1931]]. Charis, born in [[1919]], presumably attended Hogwarts from [[1930]] to [[1937]], and thus would have been a student of Slughorn for at least part of her time at Hogwarts.</ref>\n|loyalty = *[[House of Black]]<ref name=\"BFT\" />\n*[[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]\n**[[Slytherin]]\n*[[Crouch family]]\n}}\n'''Charis Crouch''' (n\u00e9e '''Black''') ([[1919]] \u2013 [[1973]]) was a [[pure-blood]] witch, the third daughter of [[Arcturus Black II|Arcturus Black]] and [[Lysandra Yaxley]] and sister of [[Callidora Black|Callidora]] and [[Cedrella Black|Cedrella]]. She was married to [[Caspar Crouch]], and produced three children: a [[Caspar Crouch's son|son]] and [[Caspar Crouch's daughters|two daughters]].<ref name=\"BFT\" />\n\nCharis may be the mother of [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Barty Crouch Snr]], although this has not been confirmed. Through her disowned sister [[Cedrella Black|Cedrella]], she is a maternal aunt of [[Arthur Weasley]]<ref>Although it has never been confirmed that Septimus and Cedrella are Arthur's parents, this can be inferred based on [[Sirius Black]]'s statement in Ch. 6 of {{OOTP}} that Arthur was \"something like [his] second cousin once removed.\" The [[House of Black|Black family tree]] establishes Cedrella as a first cousin once removed of both [[Orion Black|Orion]] and [[Walburga Black]], Sirius's parents. Thus, any children she had would be their second cousins, and second cousins once removed from their sons Sirius and Regulus. Also, almost all of Sirius's relatives can be seen on the Black family tree because both his parents were born into the House of Black, making it unlikely that he could be related to Arthur in a way not shown.

The Greek ''charis'' means \"grace, kindness.\"\n\nLike her mother [[Lysandra Yaxley|Lysandra]] and her sister [[Callidora Black|Callidora]], Charis is named after a type of butterfly or moth, specifically a butterfly genus of the Riodinini tribe.\n\nThere is an asteroid called {{Wikilink|627 Charis}} which was discovered on 4 March 1907 (twelve years before Charis's birth); this connects her to the Black family's history of astrological names.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n\n* On the left side of the family tree, where are depicted ancient ancestors, we can see [[Phoebe Black]], whose face is similar to Charis. The production team simply recycled Charis's face to save time, as they did with [[Elladora Black|Elladora]] and [[Callidora Black|Callidora]].\n* As she was born in 1919, she would have been one of Horace Slughorn's first ever Slytherin students, as he became Potions Master in 1931. Depending on when in 1919 she was born, she would have been a first or second year.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{OOTP|F}} {{Comment|Appears on Black family tapestry}}\n*{{OOTP|G}} {{Comment|Seen on [[House of Black|Black family]] tree tapestry}}\n*{{DH|G1}} {{Comment|Seen on [[House of Black|Black family]] tree tapestry}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Black, Charis}}\n[[de:Charis Black]]\n[[ru:\u0427\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0443\u0447]]\n[[es:Charis Black]]\n[[fr:Charis Black]]\n[[pl:Charis Crouch]]\n[[Category:1919 births]]\n[[Category:1973 deaths]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Crouch family]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:House of Black]]\n[[Category:Married individuals]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Pure-bloods]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
