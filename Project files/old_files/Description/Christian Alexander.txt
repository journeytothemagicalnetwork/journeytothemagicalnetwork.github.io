He once signed up for [[Quidditch]] training at 7pm on Tuesday on a sign-up sheet that was posted on the [[Gryffindor Notice Board|bulletin board]] in the [[Gryffindor Common Room]].<ref>{{See image|File:QuidditchTrainingSignupSheet.jpg}}</ref>\n==Etymology==\n*\"Christian\" is from the Medieval Latin name 'Christianus' meaning \"a Christian\". In England it has been in use since the Middle Ages, during which time it was used by both males and females, but it did not become common until the 17th century.\n*\"Alexander\" is from the personal name ''Alexander'', classical Greek ''Alexandros'', which probably originally meant \u2018repulser of men (i.e. of the enemy)\u2019, from ''alexein'' \u2018to repel\u2019 + ''andros'', genitive of ''aner'' \u2018man\u2019. Its popularity in the Middle Ages was due mainly to the Macedonian conqueror, Alexander the Great (356\u2013323 bc)\u2014or rather to the hero of the mythical versions of his exploits that gained currency in the so-called Alexander Romances.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WWHP}} {{Mentioned on a poster}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Alexander, Christian}}\n[[es:Christian Alexander]]\n[[pl:Christian Alexander]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Quidditch players]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
