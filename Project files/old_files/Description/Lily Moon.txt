[[1979]]-[[1980]]) was a witch who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]]. She was in the same year as [[Harry Potter]] and was Sorted into either [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]], or [[Slytherin]].<ref name=\"PS7\">{{PS|B|7}}</ref><ref name=house />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Only Lily's surname was revealed during the [[Sorting ceremony]] in {{PS}}, but on the student list shown on {{HPM}}, the first three letters of her first name could be made out as either \"Lil-\" or \"Lib-\". Her full first name was finally revealed by [[J. K. Rowling]] as supplementary content on the {{PM}} website.<ref name=\"pottermore\">{{PM}} (transcription available [http://lady-slytherin-forever.tumblr.com/post/8979923935/the-original-forty-off-pottermore here])</ref> According to Rowling, this character was named before she settled on the name of [[Harry Potter]]'s [[Lily J. Potter|mother]], and was the \"first intimation of [[Luna Lovegood]],\" giving her the idea for a \"fey, dreamy girl.\"<ref name=\"pottermore\" />\n*During a practical examination, for their\u00a0[[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]], Lily was not called to take her test. She would usually appear after [[Draco Malfoy]] but before\u00a0[[Theodore Nott]]. This could just be a mistake of\u00a0[[J. K. Rowling]]'s, or Lily may have been unable to attend her test. It is possible that she had failed her exams at a point between first and fourth year, forcing her to repeat the year.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{PS}} {{1st Mention}}\n*{{HPM}} {{Mention}}\n*{{PM}} {{1st ID}} {{Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Moon, Lily}}\n[[de:Lily Moon]]\n[[fr:Lily Moon]]\n[[ru:\u041b\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u041c\u0443\u043d]]\n[[pl:Lily Moon]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Moon family]]\n[[Category:Sorted in 1991]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
