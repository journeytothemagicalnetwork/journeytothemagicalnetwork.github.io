In her childhood, she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], and was singled out for membership in the [[Slug Club]]. [[Horace Slughorn]] kept a picture of her in a Viking maiden costume on his shelf, which she had inscribed, \"Best wishes.\"\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*Based on her signature, her surname appears to begin with the letters ''Fl-'', followed by either an ''-a-'' or an ''-e-''. The very last part of the name is Peri.\n**It is possible that her name is Dahlia Fleur-Peri.\n*It is possible, as a former [[Slug Club]] member, that she attended the [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]] in [[1996]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{HBP|F}} {{Photograph}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:F., Dahlia}}\n[[pl:Dahlia F.]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Slug Club]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
