During this war his maternal uncles [[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]] and [[Gideon Prewett]], both members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], were murdered while fighting a group of four [[Death Eaters]] led by [[Antonin Dolohov]].<ref name=\"OOTP\" /> While he was still a toddler, the war ended for a time after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s first defeat at the hands of Ron's classmate-to-be [[Harry Potter]] on [[31 October]], [[1981]].\n\nRon and his five older brothers \u2014 [[William Weasley|Bill]], [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]], [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]] \u2014 as well as his younger sister, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], grew up in [[The Burrow]] on the outskirts of [[Ottery St Catchpole]] in [[Devon]], [[England]]. Like all his siblings, he was home educated in reading, writing and simple mathematics by his mother. The [[Weasley family]] was not wealthy at all, compared to other wizarding families.<ref name=\"GOF\" /> Many other [[pure-blood]] families, particularly the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]], disdained them for their \"''[[blood traitor]]''\" beliefs and lack of wealth. They tried their best to make up for this with their [[love]].<ref name=\"CS\">{{COS}}</ref>\n\nThe Weasley siblings, especially Fred and George, were fond of teasing and playing pranks on each other, and Ron was a particular target for Fred and George. They once [[Transfiguration|transfigured]] Ron's teddy bear into a giant spider, sparking his arachnophobia. On another occasion, the twins nearly got him to make an Unbreakable Vow, which finally made their father truly furious (and Fred would later state that his left buttock has \"''never been the same since''\" after the row that ensued). They also once got him to eat an [[Acid Pops|Acid Pop]] which burnt a hole through his tongue.\n\nWhen Ron was younger, he had a pet rat named Scabbers, whom he had inherited from Percy. This rat was actually [[Peter Pettigrew]], a traitor to all wizardkind. Ron was very fond of Scabbers, but wasn't sad to let him go when he found out the truth about his old rat.<ref name=\"GOF\" /><ref name=\"FB\">{{FB}}</ref> Ron had a fairly happy childhood, which Harry, who had been brought up by his spiteful relatives the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]], envied. To compensate for their impoverishment, Ron's mother indulged him in three delicious meals daily. This became so habitual that missing a meal in later life would irritate Ron.\n\n===Hogwarts years {{C|1991\u20131997}}===\n====First year====\n=====Meeting Harry and Hermione=====\n[[File:Trio meet.jpg|250px|thumb|The [[trio]] meet for the first time on the Hogwarts Express]]\n[[File:Ron_And_The_Sorting_Hat.png|250px|thumb|Ron being [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]] by the [[Sorting Hat]]]]<!-- It's okay to have images on the same side. Don't do things for the sake of doing it. -->\nRon began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]] at the customary age of eleven. He was Sorted into Gryffindor House, like every other Weasley. On his first trip on the [[Hogwarts Express]], Ron met and became friends with the famous wizard [[Harry Potter]]. Harry let him share his carriage on the Hogwarts Express and purchased a large amount of wizarding snacks from the [[Hogwarts Express]] [[Honeydukes Express|food trolley]] to share with him. Later on, Harry would stand up for Ron against [[Slytherin]] bully Draco Malfoy and Ron would elect to be his second for a midnight duel.<ref name=\"PS\"/> \n\nRon and Harry first met [[Hermione Granger]] on the [[Hogwarts Express|train]] but Ron did not particularly take to her. Ron, especially, was annoyed by what he saw as Hermione showing off her knowledge of [[magic]], such as when she corrected him on the pronunciation of the incantation ''[[Levitation Charm|Wingardium Leviosa]]''.<ref name=\"PS\"/>\n\n=====Hallowe'en=====\n[[File:Harry-potter1-harry ron troll.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Ron and Harry after having defeated a fully grown Mountain troll]]\nPrior to the [[Hallowe'en feast]], Ron said that Hermione was a know-it-all and did not have any friends. Hermione overheard and went running to the girl's bathroom in tears. That evening, during the Hallowe'en feast, it was announced that a [[Troll in the Bathroom|mountain troll]] was loose in the school. Ron and Harry came to Hermione's rescue after hearing that she was in trouble, with Ron successfully using the [[Levitation Charm]] to [[Levitation|levitate]] the [[troll]]'s club and drop it on its head, knocking it out. She, in return, lied to protect them from Professor McGonagall. The three then became very close friends.<ref name=\"PS\"/>\n\n=====Protecting the Stone=====\n{{Quote|I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see.

Ron's talent in [[Wizard's Chess]] allowed them to pass one of the obstacles protecting the stone, which was a life-sized game. Ron sacrificed himself as a game piece so Harry could place the enemy king in checkmate, allowing Harry and Hermione to move on. Ultimately, it was discovered that Professor Quirrell was trying to steal the stone for Voldemort. Harry succeeded in defeating him and protecting the Philosopher's Stone, and Ron was awarded fifty [[House points]] by [[Albus Dumbledore]] for \"''the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years,''\" allowing Gryffindor to win the [[House Cup]] for the first time in seven years.<ref name=\"PS\" />\n\n====Second year====\n=====Flying the Ford Anglia=====\n{{Quote|LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN'T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED \u2014ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED \u2014 YOUR FATHER'S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.|Molly Weasley's nasty howler|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\n\n[[File:Harry-potter2-flying_car.jpg|245px|thumb|Ron and Harry flying a car to school in their [[second year]]]]\n\nHaving not heard from [[Harry Potter]] during the whole summer of [[1992]], Ron, Fred and George Weasley, in a planned scheme to rescue him from [[4 Privet Drive]], drove Arthur Weasley's [[flying Ford Anglia]] to the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] town of [[Little Whinging]] and tore the bars from Harry's bedroom window using the car's horsepower. Ron helped Harry get his things in the car, and they left for the Weasley House. Upon landing Ron and his brothers were ratted out by Molly Weasley for having taken such a risky course of action. At the start of that year's school term, Ron and Harry missed the [[Hogwarts Express]] due to the tricks of [[Dobby]] the house-elf and were forced to use the Ford Anglia to travel to Hogwarts. At the end of their journey, the car failed, causing the boys to crash-land into the Whomping Willow. They were nearly killed when the tree shook, and the car jettisoned them and took off into the [[Forbidden Forest]], where it remained.<ref name=\"CS\" />\n\n=====Attempt to curse Malfoy=====\n[[File:Trio_writing_on_wall.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The writing on the wall and the petrified form of [[Mrs Norris]]]]\n\n[[Charles Weasley's wand|Ron's wand]] was damaged in the crash, causing him problems for the entire school year. It backfired when Ron attempted to [[curse]] [[Draco Malfoy]] in payback for calling Hermione a \"[[Mudblood]]\" with the [[Slug-vomiting Charm]], resulting with him burping up [[slug]]s and slime. Malfoy's disdain towards [[Muggle-born]]s led Ron, Harry, and Hermione to suspect that he was the [[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]] who opened the [[Chamber of Secrets]] that year, unleashing a \"[[Serpent of Slytherin|monster]]\" that began to attack Muggle-born students.<ref name=\"CS\" />\n\n=====Impersonating Crabbe=====\nTo investigate this theory, Hermione brewed [[Polyjuice Potion]] which greatly surprised Ron in that she was so overtly breaking the rules. When the time came to use the potion, Ron was made to impersonate [[Vincent Crabbe]], and Harry impersonated [[Gregory Goyle]], while Hermione's transformation was unsuccessful because she mistook hair from [[Millicent Bulstrode]]'s [[Millicent Bulstrode's cat|cat]] for her own. Ron and Harry realised that Malfoy was not the Heir of Slytherin.<ref name=\"CS\" />\n\n=====Return to the Forbidden Forest=====\nRon and Harry were both greatly upset when Hermione became another victim of the \"monster,\" ending up [[petrification|petrified]] in the Hospital Wing, though she left her friends a clue that led them to deduce that the monster was a [[Serpent of Slytherin|basilisk]]. Ron showed incredible bravery during the course of their investigation by venturing into the Forbidden Forest to an [[Acromantula]] den led by [[Aragog]], in spite of his extreme fear of spiders. They learned [[Rubeus Hagrid]] had nothing to do with opening the chamber, but when Aragog tried to make a meal of them, they narrowly escaped thanks to the magic that had engulfed the Flying Ford Anglia.<ref name=\"CS\" />\n\n=====Skirmish in the Chamber of Secrets=====\n[[File:Harry-potter2-chamber.jpg|250px|thumb|Ron, Harry, and Lockhart standing in the Chamber of Secrets next to Basilisk skin]]\n\nWhen he and Harry learned that [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] (Ron's younger sister) was dying in the Chamber of Secrets, they raced to save her, planning to give their information to Professor [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]. When the pair discovered that the professor was attempting to flee, they drew their wands on him and forced him to join them as they ventured into the Chamber of Secrets. Shortly after Ron, Harry, and Lockhart entered the Chamber, Lockhart attempted to [[Memory Charm|wipe their memories]] in order to get out of the Chamber and take credit for their efforts in a bid for fame. Unfortunately for him, he used Ron's damaged wand, and the spell backfired, causing permanent amnesia in Lockhart. Ron was left behind to tend to Lockhart, as Harry delved deeper into the Chamber, saving Ginny and defeating [[Serpent of Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin's basilisk]].<ref name=\"CS\" />\n\nRon was honoured with a [[Special Award for Services to the School]], as well as earning two hundred House points for Gryffindor for his work concerning re-sealing the Chamber of Secrets.<ref name=\"CS\" />\n\n====Third year====\n{{Dialogue|Harry Potter|Where's the dog?|Ron|Not a dog.

Ron and his family used the money to travel to Egypt to visit Ron's eldest brother, [[William Weasley|Bill]]. News of their lucky break made the ''Daily Prophet'', and Ron sent that newspaper clipping and a [[Sneakoscope]] to [[Harry Potter|Harry]] for his thirteenth birthday. They met on the last day of the summer, when Ron and his family visited [[Diagon Alley]] with Harry and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and took up rooms in the [[Leaky Cauldron]] in preparation for catching the [[Hogwarts Express]].<ref name=\"POA\"/>\n\nDuring their stay at the Leaky Cauldron, Ron shared a room with his brother Percy. Unfortunately, this led to a fight. Percy believed that Ron had taken his Head Boy badge, which had actually been stolen by Weasley twins Fred and George. Harry found the twins hiding, enchanting the badge to say \"''Big Head Boy''\". Later, Ron was also accused of smudging a picture of Percy's girlfriend, [[Penelope Clearwater]] with tea (Penelope thus hid herself outside the frame so nobody could see her splotched nose).<ref name=\"POA\"/>\n\n[[File:B3C5M7 Dementor on Hogwarts Express.png|250x250px|thumb|Dementors board the Hogwarts Express in search of Sirius Black]]\n\nAlso that summer, Sirius Black, the most famous prisoner in [[Azkaban]], escaped, and in light of this incident, security was tightened at Hogwarts which Ron and his friends noticed when the Hogwarts Express was stopped and searched by [[Dementor]]s. Once at the school, [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] announced that Dementors would be stationed around the school gates to prevent Black from entering Hogwarts. This was done under the assumption that Harry was being targeted by Black.<ref name=\"POA\"/> \n\n=====Beginning of term=====\nUpon starting the term, the [[third year]]s began taking new lessons. Ron and Harry had chosen [[Divination]] and [[Care of Magical Creatures]], while Hermione decided to take every possible class offered and began to exhibit strange behaviour that neither Ron nor Harry could figure out. The pair quickly decided that Divination was not a class they really liked and that the professor, [[Sybill Trelawney]], was a fraud. Ron's first Care of Magical Creatures was a disaster. [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], the new Care of Magical Creatures professor, had planned what he thought to be a spectacular class on [[hippogriff]]s, when a hippogriff named [[Buckbeak]] attacked [[Draco Malfoy]] after Malfoy had insulted the rare creature, causing Malfoy to promise revenge. Also during that week, Ron had his first [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class with the new professor, [[Remus Lupin]], and in short order Ron thought that Lupin was an excellent professor.<ref name=\"POA\"/>\n\n=====First time in Hogsmeade=====\n[[File:Tumblr_mqmg5k5aLP1rrszjzo3_250.gif|240x240px|thumb|left|Ron, Harry, and Hermione at [[Hogsmeade]]]]\n\nOn Hallowe'en, Ron and Hermione went on their first Hogsmeade trip. Harry, however, could not join them as his [[Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]] had not signed his Hogsmeade permission slip. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione visited every building in Hogsmeade and brought back loads of sweets from Honeydukes for Harry. That evening, Sirius Black sneaked into Hogwarts, and the students were forced to spend the night in the Dining Hall.<ref name=\"POA\"/>\n\n=====Scabbers disappears=====\nJust before [[Christmas]], Rubeus Hagrid received a complaint from the [[Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures]] about Buckbeak the hippogriff. When he shared this incident with Ron, Harry, and Hermione, the trio promised to do everything in their power to help defend Buckbeak. Ron and Harry put the defence of Buckbeak on the back-burner when on Christmas Day, Harry received a [[Firebolt]] broomstick from a mysterious sender. When Hermione, afraid for Harry's safety, turned the Firebolt in, Ron stopped talking to Hermione. The Firebolt incident only added to the rough tension between the two, as Hermione's new pet [[Crookshanks]] had been continually trying to attack Ron's rat, Scabbers. A few weeks later, when the two were on the verge of making up, Scabbers disappeared and Ron blamed Crookshanks, threatening the friendship between them.<ref name=\"POA\"/>\n\n=====Sirius Black's infiltration=====\n[[File:Ron Flying Firebolt.png|246x246px|thumb|Ron riding Harry's Firebolt for the first time on the [[Hogwarts Quidditch pitch]]]]\n\nIn the meantime, Black was yet to be found, and the night following the [[Gryffindor]] vs [[Ravenclaw]] [[Quidditch]] match, he sneaked into Gryffindor tower. Hearing the sound of ripping bed curtains, Ron awoke with a start to see Sirius Black standing over him holding a knife. He screamed, and Black fled.<ref name=\"POA\"/>\n\n=====Defence of Buckbeak=====\nThis incident made Ron famous among the other students, but he came back down to Earth when Hagrid scolded him and Harry about their treatment of Hermione, who Hagrid told them was in over her head with all of her classes and the work she was doing for Buckbeak. Shocked, the pair patched things up with her a few days later, when they received a letter from Hagrid saying that Buckbeak had been sentenced to execution.<ref name=\"POA\"/>\n\nWith exams coming up, the trio set about studying and attempting to help Hagrid with Buckbeak's appeal. The appeal took place on the [[6 June|last day of their exams]]. Hearing that Buckbeak had lost, and was to be executed, Ron, Harry and Hermione went to visit Hagrid in the evening just before the execution. They offered to help set the record straight, but Hagrid told them that they would be in big trouble if they were seen. Helping the sobbing Hagrid make tea, Hermione found Scabbers hiding inside a milk jar. Soon they were hurried out the back of the hut, all the while they continued to lobby for a chance to set the record straight. When they heard what sounded like the killing, Ron, Harry and Hermione set off for Hogwarts in a slight state of shock.<ref name=\"POA\"/>\n\n=====The Prisoner of Azkaban=====\n[[File:Sirius ron whomping willow.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Sirius Black]] captures Ron and drags him to the Whomping Willow]]\n\nBefore they made it back there, [[Peter Pettigrew#Scabbers|Scabbers]] began to squirm in Ron's hands and escaped. Not wanting to lose his rat again, Ron chased after Scabbers with Harry and Hermione behind him. He caught up to Scabbers, but not before they were in the shadow of the [[Whomping Willow]] tree. He looked up to see a large black dog bearing down upon him. The dog dived at Ron and gripping Ron's arm in its mouth, it dragged him into the Whomping Willow. To try and stop the dog from pulling him further, Ron tied his feet around a tree branch, but the dog's grip was so powerful his leg snapped. When the dog reached the Shrieking Shack, it let go of Ron and revealed itself to be Sirius Black.<ref name=\"POA\"/>\n\nSirius ambushed Harry and Hermione, [[Disarming Charm|disarming]] them when they entered the room where Ron was being held hostage. Upon seeing him, Harry attacked Black with Hermione and the seriously injured Ron helping in any way they could, but Harry could not bring himself to finish the job when he had Black in his power, and he was disarmed by [[Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]]. Relieved at the sight of Lupin, Ron became worried when Lupin and Black greeted each other like brothers and demanded that Ron turn over his rat, Scabbers. Sirius and Lupin then told them about their own years spent at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and how a wizard named [[Peter Pettigrew]] betrayed Harry's parents to Voldemort then framed Sirius and transformed into a rat to go into hiding. Still not fully convinced, Ron reluctantly handed over Scabbers when Lupin promised that if he was actually a rat, no harm would come to him. Scabbers was revealed to be Pettigrew, whom Sirius had recognised due to a missing toe. (Pettigrew has cut off one of his own fingers before transforming). A tearful Pettigrew confessed to the betrayal and begged for mercy from his former friends.<ref name=\"POA\"/>\n\n[[File:Dumbledore Bedside Manner POA.jpg|234x234px|thumb|Ron in the Hospital Wing with his broken leg]]\n\nWhen it was decided that Pettigrew should be turned over to the [[Dementor]]s, Lupin splinted Ron's leg, and the assembled company left for Hogwarts. Along the way, the full moon broke out, and Lupin began to transform into a werewolf. In the skirmish, Pettigrew stole Lupin's wand, [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] Ron, and escaped into the moonlight. Hours later in the [[Hospital Wing]] where he was recovering both from his broken leg and Pettigrew's attack, Ron was told that Harry and Hermione had managed to [[Rescue of Sirius Black and Buckbeak|save]] Sirius and Buckbeak from the [[Dementor's Kiss]] with Hermione's [[Time-Turner|time turner]].<ref name=\"POA\"/> \n\n=====End of term=====\nRon understood why Hermione did not immediately mention the time turner. Ron was slightly dismayed but, now knew the reason for her strange behaviour and timetable earlier on, he was nevertheless relieved that Sirius and Buckbeak were both safe and free. As a replacement for his lost pet, Sirius sent Ron a tiny owl, which Ginny immediately named [[Pigwidgeon]] because she thought the name was \"''sweet''\"; annoyed and disgusted at this, Ron tried to choose another name, but it was too late, so he settled for using the nickname \"Pig\".<ref name=\"POA\"/>\n\n====Fourth year====\n{{Quote|Look, it's always you who gets all the attention, you know it is.

While Hermione joined the [[Weasley family|Weasleys]] at [[the Burrow]], Harry had to be picked up from the Dursleys. Arthur Weasley arranged to pick up Harry via [[Floo Network]], not knowing that the Dursleys' fireplace was blocked, so when Ron, Arthur, Fred, and George tried to fetch Harry they ended up stuck in the chimney. Part of the Dursley's house was destroyed before Harry returned to the Weasley's house.<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n\nThe following day, Harry, Hermione, and all the Weasleys except Molly Weasley left for the Quidditch World Cup, where they set up camp and met many of their friends from Hogwarts or the Ministry. They had prime seats for the match, thanks to Mr Weasley, who had helped [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]], Head of the [[Department of Magical Games and Sports]], out of a messy problem. During the match Ron watched [[Viktor Krum]], the [[Bulgaria]]n [[Seeker]], play an excellent match and catch the [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]]. Even though Krum caught the Snitch the Irish National Quidditch Team still won the match.<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n\n[[File:The trio seeing the Dark Mark.png|240x240px|thumb|Ron, [[Harry Potter|Harry]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] after the riot at the Quidditch World Cup]]\n\nThat night, while the Irish supporters were still awake celebrating their victory, trouble began. Some [[Death Eaters]] who had managed to avoid imprisonment in Azkaban, attacked the camp where Ron and his friends and family were staying. Mr Weasley ordered Ron, Harry, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny to get to safety, while he and the older Weasley children set off to help the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Fred and George were responsible for Ginny's safety, which left the trio to themselves.<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n\nRunning off into the woods, Ron, Hermione, and Harry quickly lost Fred, George and Ginny, but they did find [[Draco Malfoy]]. Malfoy meanly suggested that Hermione, being a Muggle-Born, could easily be targeted by the Death Eaters, causing Ron to insist that she and Harry join him in going deeper into the woods. Soon they reached a patch of woods giving off a silver glow, where the trio found a few [[Veela]] witches surrounded by admirers. Ron was entranced and stated that he would create a broom that would fly to space. They had reached an empty clearing when they heard an [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|unknown person]] [[Morsmordre|cast]] the [[Dark Mark]].<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n\n=====The year begins=====\n[[File:B4C14M1 DADA Unforgivable Curses.png|249x249px|thumb|left|The trio during a Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson on the Unforgivable Curses]]\n\nOn 1 September, Ron and his friends departed for Hogwarts aboard the [[Hogwarts Express]]. That evening at the [[Welcoming Feast]], [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] announced that Hogwarts would host the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. Ron found himself caught up in dreams of being a Triwizard Champion, but he was snapped back to reality by his fourth year classes. In [[Care of Magical Creatures]], [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] had his students tending to [[Blast-Ended Skrewt]]s, and in [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], Ron was impressed by the new professor, [[Alastor Moody|\"Mad-Eye\" Moody]], when he taught the class about the three [[Unforgivable Curses]]. It was announced that the students from the [[Durmstrang Institute]] and [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]] would be arriving at Hogwarts on 30 October. Ron was dumbstruck when he saw [[Viktor Krum]] among the Durmstrang students, not realising how young his hero was. He was disappointed when Krum sat among the Slytherin students.<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n\n=====Envying Harry Potter=====\n[[File:Harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-ron goblet.jpg|250px|thumb|An angry Ron and an upset Hermione watch as Harry's name comes out of the [[Goblet of Fire]]]]\n\nHaving discussed the possibility of somehow outsmarting the [[Goblet of Fire]] and the [[Age Line]] that Dumbledore had cast around it, Ron was surprised to find that Harry's name had come out of the Goblet of Fire. Jealous of the fact that Harry always seemed to receive all the attention, Ron refused to accept that Harry didn't put his name in the cup. He even went as far as to accuse Harry of cheating his way into the tournament. After the argument, he and Harry stopped talking to each other, and Ron began hanging out with other Gryffindors like [[Dean Thomas]] and [[Seamus Finnigan]].<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n\nWhen Ron heard Harry talking to [[Sirius Black|someone]] one night, he went down to see who it was since Harry didn't tell him about such a thing. When Harry accused Ron of trying to spy on him and when he told him who he talked to was none of Ron's business, Ron was deeply offended to the point where he tried to get Harry to tell him whom he was talking to by accusing him of practising for an interview. This only made Harry throw one of Draco Malfoy's \"''Potter Stinks''\" badges at him and tell him he could wear that during the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament. This made Ron finally realise that the reason Harry had started avoiding him was because Harry felt betrayed by him to the point where he had lost Harry's trust and respect and Harry no longer saw him as a friend, a realisation that deeply hurt Ron.<ref name=\"GOF\"/>  \n\nRon and Harry did not talk to each other again until after the First Task. After seeing just how much danger was involved in the task, Ron realised Harry would never have put his own name into the Goblet of Fire, and the two became best friends once again.<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n\n=====The Yule Ball=====\n[[File:Harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-movie-screencaps.com-9205.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Ron with his date at the Yule Ball]]\n\nSoon after the First Task, [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] told Ron and the other Gryffindor boys about the traditional [[Yule Ball]], held during the Triwizard Tournament. While all students above fourth year scampered around trying to find dates, Ron and Harry found it hard to ask girls to the ball. Struck by the beauty and charm of [[Fleur Delacour]], the Triwizard Champion from Beauxbatons Academy and a [[Half-Veela|part-Veela]] witch, Ron asked her to attend the ball with him, but fled in embarrassment without waiting for an answer. He also offended Hermione by not asking her, and then by suggesting that she did not have a date and thus could accompany him. Harry was eventually able to get them both dates with twins [[Parvati Patil|Parvati]] and Padma Patil. Ron's evening was a fiasco of the first sort. His \"''traditional''\" dress robes embarrassed him and his date, [[Padma Patil]], and when Ron saw Hermione with [[Viktor Krum]], he became intensely jealous. This led to a blazing argument between them during the end of the ball, with Ron making comments about Krum being too old for her and Hermione accusing him of ruining everything. Though their friendship did not suffer, it was clear that both had developed feelings for each other.<ref name=\"GOF\"/> \n\n[[File:Harry_ron_second_task.gif|234x234px|thumb|[[Harry Potter|Harry]] retrieving a captive Ron during the second task]]\n\nDuring the Yule Ball, Ron had overheard [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] telling the Beaubaxtons Headmistress Olympe Maxime that he was half-giant. This information was also overheard by ''Daily Prophet'' Reporter [[Rita Skeeter]], who wrote an article telling the wizarding world of Hagrid's heritage. This drove Hagrid to stop teaching for a time until Ron, Harry, and Hermione told him that they he was still their friend, no matter what.<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n\n=====Imprisoned by sea creatures=====\nOn [[24 February]], Ron was put into an enchanted sleep and tied up at the bottom of the [[Great Lake|Black Lake]], to be \"rescued\" by Harry as part of the second task of the Triwizard Tournament. When he found out that Harry had stayed behind to save Fleur's sister [[Gabrielle Delacour]] as well, Ron jokingly took him to task, but was impressed when Harry was given extra points for \"''outstanding moral fibre''\". Fleur thanked Ron and Harry in turn for helping save Gabrielle, kissing both of them on the cheek. Ron gained much attention from the other students due to his being taken hostage for the task. He proceeded to exaggerate the events of what happened until Hermione called him on it.<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n\n=====Preparing for the end=====\n[[File:B4C36M1 Snape Dark Mark reveal.png|250px|thumb|left|Ron was present when the Minister for Magic visited Harry in the hospital wing]]\n\nEarly in the spring, Ron joined Harry and Hermione in visiting [[Sirius Black]], who had taken to hiding in Hogsmeade. There, they discussed the disappearances of Ministry officials [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Barty Crouch Snr]] and [[Bertha Jorkins]]. In the weeks leading up to the final tournament task, Ron and Hermione helped Harry prepare by researching and trying out different jinxes and other helpful spells for the task. Ron and Hermione watched Harry together from the sidelines.<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n\nThey were shocked when Harry returned with [[Cedric Diggory]]'s dead body. Ron was relieved to see Harry when he was brought to the infirmary by [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], eagerly wanted to question Harry about Diggory, but he was told off by Molly Weasley who, along with his brother [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], had come to watch Harry. Ron was furious with the Minister for Magic, [[Cornelius Fudge]], when he refused to believe Harry and Dumbledore, and calmed Molly when she was shocked by Black's appearance in the room. Ron did not go against Harry's story when he finally heard it, sticking by his best friend.<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n\n====Fifth year====\n{{Quote|Weasley cannot save a thing, he cannot block a single ring.<br />That's why Slytherins all sing, Weasley is our king!...|[[Slytherin]]s mocking Ron's [[Keeper]] abilities|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n\n[[File:B5C6M1 Doxycide Grimmauld Place.jpg|250px|thumb|Ron with others in 12 Grimmauld Place preparing to clean]]\n\nAfter Voldemort rose to power and the [[Second Wizarding War]] began, [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] reformed the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. In the summer of 1995, the Order moved into their headquarters at [[12 Grimmauld Place]] with the Weasley schoolchildren and Hermione Granger, where they helped [[Molly Weasley]] clean the old house and remained watchful for information about Harry. In August, Harry arrived at the headquarters after a [[Attack in Little Whinging|Dementor attack]] on his cousin. Ron felt sorry that he had to keep Harry oblivious to the Order's plan and soon learnt that Harry's anger had been growing due to his isolation from his friends and his persecution by the media.<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\nRon, Harry and Hermione stayed at Grimmauld Place throughout August. In late August, Ron and Hermione were made a [[Gryffindor]] [[prefect]], for which Molly and Arthur gave Ron a new [[Cleansweep Eleven]]. Bound by their prefect duties, Ron and Hermione were separated from Harry on the [[Hogwarts Express]] and could only join Harry in his compartment for the last part of the journey. When they arrived, Ron expressed concern that [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] was not at the welcoming feast and was suspicious of the new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor, [[Dolores Umbridge]].<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\n[[File:Umbridge teaching.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The first DADA class with Umbridge as the professor]]\n\nAt school, Ron was one of the many students who expressed frustration with Professor Umbridge's refusal to teach the class practical defensive magic. He also won the position of [[Keeper]] on the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] but was described by the team captain as \"needing improvement\". Ron's [[Quidditch]] practice caused him to fall behind in his schoolwork, to Hermione's chagrin. Soon, Ron's brother [[Percy Weasley]] sent him a letter advising him not to remain friends with Harry, whom he accused of being mad for supporting [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]].<ref name=\"OOTP\"/> Ron was outraged by the letter's contents, tearing it into eight pieces and throwing it into the Gryffindor common room's fireplace, angrily declaring his brother to be \"the world's biggest git.\"\n\n=====Initiating Dumbledore's Army=====\nLate in September, one evening when Harry returned from detention with Professor Umbridge, Ron, somewhat reluctantly, joined Hermione in convincing that Harry teach his fellow students defence against the dark arts. Harry initially disagreed, but after a few days he decided to give it a go. Around this time, Professor Umbridge was appointed the first [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor]], giving her the power to randomly create new school rules and inspect teachers' lessons.<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\n[[File:DA meeting ootp.jpg|250x250px|thumb|Ron during the meeting of students in the [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]] that would become known as Dumbledore's Army]]\n\nLate in October, students had their first visit to [[Hogsmeade]]. There, Harry, Ron, and Hermione met with several students who were interested in learning proper defence. Ron defended Harry against [[Zacharias Smith]]''' '''when questions rose, and was among the first to sign the recruitment parchment. On the way home from Hogsmeade, Ron became upset when he learned from Hermione that his sister [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] was dating Ravenclaw student [[Michael Corner]]. The following morning, Ron awoke to find that suddenly, by order of Professor Umbridge, all student groups had been disbanded including the House Quidditch teams, but he was mollified when Harry said they would continue with their secret group, which Ginny named \"''[[Dumbledore's Army]]''\" during their first meeting, mocking the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]'s fears of student uprisings.<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\n=====Playing Quidditch and Hagrid's tale=====\nIn the weeks following the first Dumbledore's Army meeting, Quidditch season arrived. Ron had nervous issues prior to the first match against Slytherin. They had made badges saying \"''Weasley is our king'',\" which Harry decided could not mean anything good. In an attempt to distract Ron from the Slytherins, Hermione kissed him on the cheek for luck, effectively stunning Ron. Ron's play was abysmal, and it was not helped by the Slytherins' new song also entitled, \"''[[Weasley is Our King]]''\". Following the game Ron wanted to resign, but learned he could not, as Harry Potter, [[Fred Weasley|Fred]], and [[George Weasley]] had been banned from Quidditch for life. That evening Hagrid returned from his unknown disappearance. Although initially resistant he regaled the trio with his tales of the [[giant]]s, though he refused to give them any hint about his gruesome injuries from Golgomath's tribe. Ultimately Hagrid's mission was a failure.<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\n[[File:Order-of-the-phoenix-weasleys harry.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry informs the Weasleys of their father's attack at the Ministry]]\n\nFollowing Hagrid's return, he took up his post as [[Care of Magical Creatures]] professor. In Hagrid's first lesson, Ron learned about [[Thestral]]s, magical creatures that could only be seen by wizards and witches who had witnessed death.<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\n=====The attack on Arthur Weasley=====\nFrequent Dumbledore's Army meetings, [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] homework, and his prefect duties took up most of Ron's time as the holidays approached. Following the last meeting of the term, Ron was amazed at Harry's \"romantic\" tale, earning him a stern talking to from Hermione who suggested that Ron had ''\"the emotional range of a teaspoon''.\" That night, Harry witnessed Ron's father, [[Arthur Weasley]], being attacked by Lord Voldemort's snake, [[Nagini]]. When Harry's story was confirmed by Dumbledore and McGonagall, Ron, his siblings, and Harry were immediately sent to the Order's Headquarters, so they could look in on their father's convalescence, and there they spent the [[Christmas holidays]], joined by Hermione the next day.<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\nDuring their first trip to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]] Hospital, Ron overheard \"[[Alastor Moody|Mad Eye\" Moody]] thinking that Harry had been possessed by Voldemort. Ron was worried when Harry became quiet after the visit and wanted to talk to Harry about it. He got his chance after Hermione arrived and convinced Harry to come downstairs. Ron, Hermione, and Ginny told Harry how worried they had been and managed to confess that he was not being possessed. They had an enjoyable holiday, but on their second visit to the hospital, Ron learned the truth about the torture of [[Neville Longbottom]]'s parents.<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\n[[File:DA Luna Fred Ginny George Ron.jpg|250px|thumb|Ron with siblings Fred and George, and Ginny practising with the [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]]]]\n[[File:RonExpectoPatronum.gif|250px|thumb|Ron conjuring his Patronus]]\n\nThroughout the term, Ron continued to learn defensive and offensive magic from Harry. He also stayed on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, despite his very poor performances. Due to Quidditch, he missed the [[Valentine's Day]] visit to Hogsmeade. Though, he was impressed that Harry went public and hopeful that people might believe Harry when ''[[The Quibbler]]'' came out. Soon, Umbridge managed to sack [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]], but her ability to name a replacement was pre-empted when [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] arranged to have [[Firenze]] the Centaur teach the subject. Umbridge was affronted by this new staffing appointment.<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\n=====Marietta Edgecombe's betrayal=====\nSoon after Trelawney's sacking, [[Marietta Edgecombe]], a friend of Ravenclaw Student [[Cho Chang]]'s who only reluctantly joined Dumbledore's Army, told Umbridge about the group, but was unable to give up any pertinent information once she saw a [[Dumbledore's Army parchment jinx|jinx]] activate on her face. Ron was able to escape when Umbridge, raided the Dumbledore's Army headquarters, but he was incensed when Professor Dumbledore was forced out of the school. He was also wary when his brothers Fred and George Weasley said they were going to do their part for Professor Dumbledore. After Fred and George's secret escape from Hogwarts, Ron was certain that his mother would blame him, but he was saved from this fate when Harry revealed that it was he who financed [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]].<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\n[[File:DA captured by Umbridge.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Ron and other D.A. members being held captive by Umbridge]]\n\nRon played in the final Quidditch match of the season, though Harry and Hermione did not watch, as Hagrid finally revealed the source of his injuries to them. Ron played better, and Gryffindor won the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]]. Ron was unable to settle to his studies the following day, but Harry and Hermione brought him down with Hagrid's secret injuries.<ref name=\"OOTP\"/>\n\n=====Battle of the Department of Mysteries=====\nShortly thereafter, their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] exams were upon them. Ron managed to do very well, but he made a few mistakes. During their final exam, Harry dozed off and had another vision. This time, he saw Sirius being tortured by Voldemort in the Ministry. When Harry told Ron and Hermione of this they were wary, and Hermione suggested that Harry try to contact Sirius first. Ron ran off to distract Umbridge, but the plan failed, and Ron and his friends were rounded up and taken to Umbridge's office. There, Ron, Ginny, Neville, and Luna Lovegood managed to fight off Umbridge and her Slytherin Guards and escape to find Harry and Hermione outside the forest.[[File:The trio Ginny Neville Luna Death Chamber.gif|241x241px|frame|Ron, [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]], [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]], [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] in the Death Chamber]]\n\nRon insisted that he join Harry in rescuing Sirius, but also insisted that the rest remain behind, but realised when many Thestrals appeared. When Harry led them into the [[Department of Mysteries]], Ron stuck with him into the deepest recesses of the Department. There, the six Dumbledore's Army members were ambushed by twelve [[Death Eaters]], led by wizarding aristocrat [[Lucius Malfoy]], and Ron helped defend the prophecy Harry took from the Hall Of Prophecies, but his fight was soon over as a Death Eater had wiped his brains. Ron was so confused that he summoned a tentacled-brain from a vat in the Thought Chamber and was attacked by it, but soon recovered later on. Ron was devastated by [[Sirius Black|Sirius]]'s death, but Hermione made sure that Sirius's death was not discussed around Harry.\n\n====Sixth year====\n{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione Granger|You said to us once before that there was time to turn back if we wanted to. We've had time, haven't we?|Ron|We're with you, whatever happens.|A commit to Harry and his [[Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter's Horcrux Hunt|Horcrux hunt]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\n\nDuring the summer following the battle, Ron learned he had received seven [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]], only failing [[Divination]] and [[History of Magic]]. Ron explained he did not mind, as he, like Harry, didn't like those subjects very much, anyway. Also during that summer, Ron learned that his brother Bill was engaged to [[Fleur Delacour]]. While this annoyed his mother, sister, and later Hermione, Ron took to defending Fleur and if she surprised him, he would still take on that dumbstruck look. His soft spot for Fleur particularly annoyed Hermione, who was finding it harder to keep her feelings for him under wraps. When Ron and Hermione learned that [[Harry Potter|Harry]] was in fact the \"Chosen One,\" Ron remained at Harry's side.<ref name=\"HBP\"/>\n\n=====A rough start=====\n[[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-ron tryouts.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Ron trying out as [[Keeper]] for the Gryffindor Quidditch team]]\n\nRon would suffer much personal turmoil in his sixth year. Harry was named [[Gryffindor]] team captain. Ron was nervous about Quidditch try-outs, but beat out [[Cormac McLaggen]] in saves, partly because Hermione cast a [[Confundus Charm]] on McLaggen in retaliation for him insulting Ron and Ginny. He was also envious when Harry and Hermione were invited to the [[Slug Club]], while the new [[Potions (class)|Potions]] professor [[Horace Slughorn]] ignored him, and when attention was paid to him, Slughorn usually got his name wrong. During this time, Ron showed brief flashes of jealousy about Harry and Hermione's closeness. He would take exception whenever Hermione complimented Harry on something Ron thought was equally due to him. Ron was temporarily mollified about this when [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] asked if he would like to attend the club's Christmas party with her, and he agreed, but thought it was only as friends.<ref name=\"HBP\"/>\n\n[[File:Ron Keeper.jpg|250px|thumb|Ron playing as Keeper against Slytherin in the first match of the year]]\n\nRon was also worried over his sister's increasing involvement with boys, and after stumbling upon her kissing [[Dean Thomas]], he blew up at her. In retaliation, Ginny belittled him for his complete inexperience with the opposite gender, declaring that Harry and Hermione had also snogged people. The siblings treated each other coldly afterwards, and Ron was so bothered by this \u2014 and by the revelation that Hermione had kissed Viktor Krum almost two years earlier \u2014 that he began to perform poorly in Quidditch. He also began to treat Hermione with a cold indifference, which confused her. He even offered to resign from the team. To boost his confidence, Harry pretended to pour the [[Felix Felicis]] into Ron's [[Pumpkin Juice]] at breakfast. Harry even allowed Hermione to see the vial, so she would object to the cheating. This convinced Ron that he had an edge in the game, which caused him to play excellently. However, when after the match Harry revealed it was a trick, Ron rounded on Hermione and accused her of having no faith in his abilities.<ref name=\"HBP\"/>\n\n=====Dating Lavender Brown=====\nShortly thereafter, Ron began his exhibitionist relationship with [[Lavender Brown]]. Hermione, incredibly angry and hurt by Ron's vindictive actions, conjured a flock of canaries to [[Oppugno Jinx|attack]] him; the birds scratched Ron badly. Although he did not report this, he spent a long time ranting about her violent and hypocritical act, and he and Hermione stopped talking to each other after that. When Hermione attended the Slug Club's Christmas party, she had originally wanted to attend with Ron but went with his hated rival, [[Cormac McLaggen]], while Ron snogged Lavender in public and made fun of Hermione's behaviour in [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] class, reducing her to tears.<ref name=\"HBP\"/>\n\nBy Christmas break, however, Ron was becoming disenchanted with his relationship with Lavender, who had become increasingly possessive, annoyed him with the nickname \"''Won-Won'',\" and gave him a gift of a necklace that said \"''My Sweetheart''\". Hermione did not come to the[[the Burrow| Burrow]] for the holidays, as she usually did, and Ron made an attempt to speak to her after returning to school, but she ignored him.<ref name=\"HBP\"/>\n\n=====Poisoned twice=====\n[[File:Harry Potter saving a poisoned Ronald Weasley.jpg|244x244px|thumb|left|Ron having a fit after ingesting the poisoned mead]]\n\nOn [[1 March]] [[1997]], Ron ate chocolate that he believed to be one of the presents for [[Ronald Weasley's seventeenth birthday|his 17th birthday]], but was in fact a gift from [[Romilda Vane]] to Harry spiked with a [[Amortentia|love potion]]. He found the box on the floor after Harry had chucked it out of his trunk thinking in was apart of his pile of presents by the foot of his bed. Upon ingesting the chocolate, Ron became maddened with an obsessive need to see and be with Romilda. Harry thinking fast proceeded to take Ron to Slughorn's office to get an antidote. When in Slughorn's office while Harry attempted to get Slughorn in a good mood hoping to get the true memory from him, Ron was nearly killed by poisoned mead intended for [[Albus Dumbledore]]. Harry managed to save Ron with a [[bezoar]]. The bezoar was one Slughorn had in his kit taken from a previous potions lesson. If it wasn't for Harry's timely actions and quick thinking Ron would have died.<ref name=\"HBP18\">{{HBP|B|18}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Poppy Pomfrey - Ron Weasley.jpg|245x245px|thumb|A poisoned Ron being attended by [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] and visited by Harry, Hermione, and Ginny]]\n\nA panic-stricken Hermione arrived at the [[Hospital Wing]], forgetting her anger with him. Ron said Hermione's name in his sleep upon hearing her speak for the first time all day, and the two quietly reconciled after his near-death experience. Ron also took to feigning sleep whenever Lavender tried to visit him. He remained in the hospital the following week and was not able to play Keeper on Saturday [[8 March]] for the [[Gryffindor vs Hufflepuff Quidditch match (1997)|Gryffindor vs Hufflepuff Quidditch match]].<ref name=\"HBP19\">{{HBP|B|19}}</ref>\n\n=====Re-embracing friends=====\nOn Monday [[10 March]] Ron and Harry, who suffered a cracked skull from a mishit [[Bludger]] during the match, were able to leave the hospital wing, although Ron did not tell Lavender this.<ref name=\"HBP20\">{{HBP|B|20}}</ref> His subsequent avoidance of Lavender and simultaneous spending more time with Hermione made Lavender suspicious; after she spotted him and Hermione leaving the boys' dormitories, seemingly alone (Harry was with them, but under his [[Cloak of Invisibility]]), Lavender ended the relationship, much to Ron's relief. A little later, Ron was suitably impressed when Harry told him and Hermione how he managed to obtain the Horcrux memory from Professor Slughorn. A few weeks later, when Harry used ''[[Sectumsempra]]'' on [[Draco Malfoy]], Ron lent his potions book to Harry, so Professor Snape would not confiscate the Half-Blood Prince's book.<ref name=\"HBP\"/>\n=====Battle of the Astronomy Tower=====\n[[File:Funeral of Albus Dumbledore.png|251x251px|thumb|left|The [[funeral of Albus Dumbledore]]]]\n\nOn the night of the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], Ron took Felix Felicis on Harry's instructions, along with Hermione and Ginny. Those three were joined by [[Neville Longbottom]] and [[Luna Lovegood]], whom Hermione had summoned using the [[Dumbledore's Army coin|D.A. coins]]. While Hermione and Luna monitored Professor Snape's office, Ron and the others watched the [[Room of Requirement]].

He was shaken by his oldest brother [[William Weasley|Bill]]'s scarring at the hands of the vicious [[werewolf]] [[Fenrir Greyback]]. Shortly afterwards, Ron attended the funeral of Albus Dumbledore, where he comforted a sobbing Hermione.

Ron stunned one of the [[Death Eaters]] in the face while flying. Ron reassured Hermione by nuzzling her back slightly upon landing as she had been quite worried about him and he was saddened at the death of [[Alastor Moody|\"Mad-Eye\" Moody]]. He was also saddened by the death of Harry's beloved pet owl [[Hedwig]], over which he comforted Harry.

During the preparations for Bill's wedding, Mrs Weasley set Ron, Harry, and Hermione to separate tasks to prevent them from planning. On Harry's seventeenth birthday, Ron gave Harry a copy of ''[[Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches]]''. Later that evening, [[Minister for Magic]] [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] visited the Burrow to dispense the contents of Dumbledore's will.

Ron was irked and jealous that [[Viktor Krum]] was a guest, especially since he immediately complimented Hermione, who Ron quickly asked to dance shortly afterwards.

After they arrived at Luchino caf\u00e9 they were ambushed by [[Death Eaters]] [[Antonin Dolohov]] and [[Thorfinn Rowle]] there and a skirmish broke out.

This, as well as the locket's negative influence, caused great tension and animosity amongst the group of friends. When he wore the locket, Ron was sullen and suspicious, lashing out at his friends and continuously complaining. Ron abruptly abandoned his friends one evening after getting into a fight with Harry over the additional task of locating [[Sword of Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor's Sword]] in order to destroy the locket. He accused Harry of having no plan and of not being very concerned about [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], whom they had learned was punished back at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].

When Ron attempted to use Godric Gryffindor's Sword to destroy the locket, horrible incorporeal images of Harry and Hermione came forth which cruelly mocked Ron about his many insecurities, including his fears that Hermione would choose Harry over him. This brought Ron to the point of tears. However, Ron successfully stabbed the Horcrux with Godric Gryffindor's Sword.<ref name=\"DH\"/>\n\nAfterwards, Harry took Ron aside to assuage his fears about Harry and Hermione. Saving Harry's life earned him Harry's forgiveness, but Hermione \u2014 who was unaware of what the Horcrux had done \u2014 was still furious with him for his abandonment for some time and attacked him mercilessly upon sight until Harry cast a [[Shield Charm]] to stop her.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\n====Visit to the Lovegood House====\n{{Quote|Aha!

He sought to hide this happiness when around Hermione in an act of contrition. When Hermione proposed a trip to the Lovegood's house to investigate a recurring symbol, Ron wholeheartedly agreed.

They narrowly escaped, Hermione engineering it in a way that preserved Ron's alibi of being sick at home. While Harry obsessed over the Hallows, Ron and Hermione thought they should focus on finding the Horcruxes, as Dumbledore had instructed them.

Hermione hit Harry in the face with a [[Stinging Jinx|Stinging Hex]] in order to disguise him. Harry, Hermione, and Ron quickly lied and gave fake names; Harry being Vernon Dudley, Hermione being [[Penelope Clearwater]], and Ron being Stan Shunpike. Ron was beaten (his mouth extremely bloody) and was then forced to use another name, Barny Weasley. This was due to the Snatchers already knowing who Stan Shunpike was. The Snatchers also found Godric Gryffindor's sword in their tent, there was no explaining that.<ref name=\"DH\"/> \n\nThey were then brought to Malfoy Manor, where Lucius Malfoy attempted to get his son to identify Harry. Draco said that he did not know whether it was Harry or not, but immediately recognised Ron and Hermione. The trio then meet with Bellatrix Lestrange, whom separated them. Ron tried to persuade Bellatrix to take him for questioning instead of Hermione. She responded that she would interrogate him next if Hermione died during questioning, as \"''blood-traitor was next to mud-blood in her book''\". Ron was forced into the dungeon with Harry, [[Dean Thomas]], and the goblin [[Griphook]]. In the dungeon they found Luna and Mr Ollivander, whom were captured in 1996.<ref name=\"DH\"/> \n\n[[File:B7C23M1.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Dobby dropping the chandelier allowing the prisoners time to escape]]\n\nHermione was kept upstairs and tortured by Bellatrix, her screams reducing Ron to tears.

Ron disarmed Bellatrix after she avoided a chandelier dropped by Dobby, and pulled Hermione from the wreckage of the fallen chandelier, Disapparating them both to Bill and Fleur's home [[Shell Cottage]].

Harry, Ron, and Hermione apparated under the [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility cloak]] to Hogsmeade looking for a way into Hogwarts. They were soon cornered by [[Death Eaters]] set to watch the town. Ron drew his wand ready to fight them, but Harry suggested that advantage lay in stealth and that attacking would give away their position.

Hermione used the fangs to destroy the Horcrux of [[Hufflepuff's Cup]], and they then reunited with Harry. When Ron expressed desire to evacuate the [[house-elf|house-elves]] from the Kitchens, Hermione, who had always been concerned for creatures so often mistreated by society, was so touched that she ran, nuzzled and kissed him, much to Ron's delight.

They then witnessed the death of Ron's brother Fred in combat, which devastated Ron, who wanted revenge. Hermione managed to calm him by reminding him that they would have to fight on their way to finding [[Nagini]], Voldemort's final Horcrux.

However, as [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Luna Lovegood]] pointed out, his humour could occasionally be hurtful, even if unintentionally.<ref name=\"HBP\" /> During his time searching for [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s [[Horcrux]]es with [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and Hermione, Ron matured greatly, and even took to leading the trio when Harry temporarily fell into a depressive mood.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\nThough his loyalty and bravery never faltered Ron's character was also marked by occasional jealousy and insecurity rising from feeling overshadowed by his five older brothers and his parents' constant comparisons between him and their other children. He could be argumentative, a trait particularly displayed in his bickering with the equally argumentative and occasionally highly critical Hermione. Though their bickering was frequent, it was never malicious (with the brief exception of sixth year) and generally a way to hide their deeper feelings for each other. Inheriting the Weasley trait of a strong temper Ron was not above provocation especially when dealing with the spiteful treatment of Professor Snape and the bigotry and hatred of Draco Malfoy. Always willing to stand up for his friends and family even when angry with them, Ron never stopped standing up for Hermione when she faced Muggle-born related prejudice and hatred. He also stood by Harry's side when he was met with disbelief and scorn from his classmates and Wizard society in general. Ron frequently demonstrated great bravery in attempting to protect those he loved, from facing his arachnophobia to stand by Harry in his second year<ref name=\"CS\" /> to trying to take Hermione's place when [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] isolated her for interrogation with the [[Cruciatus Curse]].<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\n{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Ron|What are you doing?

Many, if not all, of Ron's possessions were hand-me-downs, including his robes, school books, wand, and even a pet rat whom he called [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]]. His family's lack of finances often made Ron a target for taunting by [[Draco Malfoy]], a spoiled, arrogant [[Slytherin]].<ref name=\"PS\" /> Ron was also prone to insecurity about his abilities, when compared to his older siblings and to his famous best friend. When he felt insecure or embarrassed, it was noted that his ears turned red. This became his tell-tale sign of his anger and embarrassment.<ref name=\"GOF\">{{GOF}}</ref> He felt as if he was consistently overshadowed by the legacy of his older brothers and the fame of Harry; this lead to a feeling of being \"''second-best''\".\n\nAlthough passionate about Quidditch, especially the [[Chudley Cannons]], and a fine flyer, Ron had a problem with nerves, and sometimes his playing ability suffered for it.<ref name=\"OOTP\"/> [[Slytherin's Locket|Salazar Slytherin's Locket]] revealed that Ron's deepest fears were that his mother loved him least and that Hermione preferred Harry to him.<ref name=\"DH\" /> He also suffered from arachnophobia, a fear originating from his brother [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] transfiguring his teddy bear into a spider when Ron was a child.<ref name=\"CS\" />\n\nRon's point of view on many topics was often that of the stereotypical wizard, which clashed many times with those of Harry and Hermione because they were both raised by [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s; but in exchange, he was typically more aware of standard factors abided by wizardkind. Examples of this are that while he liked Lupin the entire third year, the moment he discovered that Lupin was a werewolf he exclaimed \"''Get away from me, [[werewolf]]!''\"; that he was more shocked and disgusted than Harry and Hermione at discovering that Hagrid was half giant; and when he got into an argument with [[Griphook]] over wizards not giving [[goblin]]s wands. However, he was clearly very much appreciative of Dobby's sacrifice for them, as he helped Harry dig the grave, found it difficult to say stuff at the grave (it is mentioned it \"''came out thickly''\", implying he was choked up), and he had sat on a rock and stripped off his shoes and socks, giving them to Dobby to be buried in.\n\n[[File:Ron eating chicken.gif|250px|thumb|right|Ron showing his fondness for food as he enthusiastically eats chicken legs]]\nRon was particularly fond of food. He had a tendency to talk with his mouth full, often to Hermione's disgust, and a great fondness for bacon sandwiches, though he disliked corned beef sandwiches, as mentioned in his first year; his love of food eventually made him settle into a portly middle age. And like Harry, Ron was intelligent, but lacked the motivation to put forth effort in class due to incredible laziness; during their years at school, Ron frequently expected Hermione's help, and when she either refused or was unavailable, he was often dumbfounded about how to proceed. If not for Hermione's help, he would have undoubtedly failed his exams.\n\nRon was also shown to have a habit of swearing. In 1993, he called [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] something that caused Hermione to exclaim: \"''Ron!''\". Also, after [[Draco Malfoy]] insulted him, Ron told him to do something he would never have dared say in front of Mrs Weasley. He also called Draco Malfoy a \"''two face-bastard''\" during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] after saving him from a Death Eater, and rescuing him for a second time, from death.\n\nRon was brave, to a level which would put him on a par with his best friend Harry; he never hesitated to put himself into extremely dangerous situations with his best friends Harry and Hermione, and as shown many times, he would rather die than have someone else he cared about be harmed. He risked his life on many occasions, and his bravery was not unnoticed by his friends.\n\nRon was also quite pragmatic and, despite his occasionally fierce temper, was usually able to keep a more level head in stressful situations compared with Harry and Hermione. His pragmatism was demonstrated by his defence of [[Bartemius Crouch Senior]]'s harsh treatment of his house elf [[Winky]], with Ron stating that Winky liked being told what to do by Crouch to the point that she held a seat for him despite her acrophobia and that this was because she wasn't human and as such didn't think like one.<ref name=\"GOF9\">{{GOF|B|9}}</ref> Another example of Ron's pragmatic nature was when he discovered the truth about [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s past with [[Gellert Grindelwald]] as while Harry was disgusted by Dumbledore's past desires to rule over Muggles alongside Grindelwald and Dumbledore's secrecy over this, and even Hermione expressed huge shock over this, Ron simply stated that Dumbledore was still growing up at that age and changed as he got older.<ref name=\"DH20\">{{DH|B|20}}</ref> However, Ron's pragmatism occasionally made him na\u00efve and insensitive, as while he believed that Winky liked being told what to do and acknowledged that she wasn't human, he was ignorant to Winky's acrophobia and her emotional distress once she was sacked by Crouch Senior.<ref name=\"GOF9\">{{GOF|B|9}}</ref>\n\nRon was also a person who liked to do things the easy way, as he did not like to work hard. This quality was reflected in his first year when he just picked up books from the Hogwarts Library shelves randomly when finding out about [[Nicolas Flamel]]. He also had a tendency to make up predictions for his [[Divination]] homework, and frequently copied most of his homework from Hermione Granger. However, he could afford to let go of this tendency of his during tougher times, like when he researched information to help [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] in letting off Buckbeak in his third year. His peculiar trait did not seem to vanish, even after he grew up, as he [[Confundus Charm|confunded]] his driving examiner (breaking the International Statute of Secrecy which is considered illegal) and shrugged off his guilt by saying \"''I could always use a [[Supersensory Charm]] for that''\".\n\nRon was very protective of those he cared about, and this was shown perhaps, best of all, when Ginny was involved in a relationship with [[Dean Thomas]]. He was, of course, looking out for her, but his temper got the best of him and he lashed out at her, as she did the same to him.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n[[File:Ron's dog Patronus.jpg|215x215px|thumb|right|Ron's corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] (form of a Jack Russell Terrier)]]\n{{Quote|First \u2014 to Mr Ronald Weasley for the best played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award [[Gryffindor]] house [[House points|fifty points]].|[[Albus Dumbledore]] acknowledging Ron's talent at Wizard's Chess|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}\nRon was often insecure about his own abilities when compared to his elder brothers and famous best friend. However, once that lessened a bit he proved to be a powerful wizard in his own right. Ron was able to conjure a corporeal [[Jack Russell terrier]] Patronus, which is a mark of superior magical ability.\n*'''[[Wizard's Chess]]''': Ron was extremely talented at chess. It was he who taught Harry how to play. Ron and Harry often played Wizard's Chess together when they had free time.<ref name=\"PS12\"/> In his first year, his logistic ability helped him, Hermione, and Harry play past Professor McGonagall's [[Chessboard Chamber|magically Transfigured giant chessboard]] to get to the Philosopher's Stone and prevent it being stolen by Voldemort. As a result, he got fifty points for his house for \"''the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years''\", as Dumbledore himself noted.<ref name=\"PS\"/> \n[[File:Download.gif|250px|thumb|Ronald and Hermione casting the [[Stunning Spell]] during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': Ron was more than capable in battle; it is notable that he survived both the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]<ref name=\"OOTP\"/> and the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]]<ref name=\"HBP\"/> and fought very courageously in both. He fought well in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], [[Stunning Spell|stunning]] a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] while flying. This was seen as such a noticeable feat that Tonks stated that she couldn't believe it and that it was a very hard thing to do. Ron also [[Disarming Charm|disarmed]] Bellatrix Lestrange, and saved Hermione during the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]]. Later he took down [[Fenrir Greyback]] with [[Neville Longbottom]] and defeated several other Death Eaters during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. He also escaped a group of Snatchers, unharmed after he temporarily left the [[Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter's Horcrux Hunt|Horcrux hunt]].<ref name=\"DH\" /> It should also be noted that Ron had a [[Muggle duelling|physical approach to fighting]] as well as magical, as more than one occasion, he resorted to fighting physically rather than magically especially in his earlier years. He advised Harry to punch [[Draco Malfoy]] if his wand did not work during his first year as well as fight him with Neville during a Quidditch match.<ref name=\"PS\"/> He took this trait to his later years when he wrestled with Wormtail at Malfoy Manor and punched Draco after saving his life a second time during the Battle of Hogwarts.<ref name=\"DH\"/> When Ron became an [[Auror]], his skills greatly improved as he was able to track down and defeat multiple Death Eaters after the Battle of Hogwarts. He was also shown to help in overpowering [[Delphini]] when she tried to go back in time to stop Voldemort from killing Harry when he was a baby.\n{{Quote|\u201cRiddikulus!\u201d bellowed Ron, and the spider's legs vanished; it rolled over and over...|Ron's successful casting of the Boggart-Banishing Spell in his third year|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}\n[[File:RonRiddikulus.gif|thumb|Ron repelling his spider [[Boggart]] with ''Riddikulus'']]\n*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Ron was very skilled in this subject as, in 1996, he managed to achieved an 'Exceeds Expectations' grade on his O.W.L. exam which allowed him to study it further at N.E.W.T. level.<ref name=\"HBP\"/> He was able to successfully use various defensive spells, such as [[Boggart-Banishing Spell]] which he mastered in his third year.<ref name=\"POA\"/> Ron was also the co founder of [[Dumbledore's Army]] and mastered all the defensive and offensive spells that Harry taught.

He was capable of helping in turning Harry into a doppelganger of Voldemort, further showing he had increased his skills in the field.\n*'''[[Herbology]]''': Ron achieved an '[[Exceeds Expectations]]' on his O.W.L. exam. He attended N.E.W.T.-level Herbology in his sixth year.<ref name=\"HBP\"/> He could also cast Herbology related [[charm]]s such as the [[Fire-Making Spell]]<ref name=\"OOTPG\">{{OOTP|G}}</ref> and the [[Herbivicus Charm]].<ref name=\"GOFG\"/>\n{{Quote|My turn ...

In his first attempt at reading tea leaves, he predicted that Harry would receive \"a windfall, unexpected gold\".<ref name=\"POA\"/> Harry received unexpected gold the following year (by winning the [[Triwizard Tournament]] after [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] secretly submitted his name). He later inherited gold from his godfather, [[Sirius Black]], after the death of Sirius. Ron also saw \"a blob a bit like a bowler hat\" among the tea leaves. [[Cornelius Fudge]] had a bowler hat when he met with Dumbledore and Harry after [[Return of Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's re-birth]], and refused to believe Harry's story about the incident.<ref name=\"GOF\"/>\n*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': Ron was able to [[Stunning Spell|stun]] a man who attempted to attack [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] in [[1998]] without saying the [[incantation]], which is highly advanced magic.<ref name=\"DH\"/> He is also noted to have been able to achieve this at a young age as demonstrated in his second year when he attempted to \"[[Slug-Vomiting Charm|curse]]\" Draco when he insulted Hermione. The curse worked without him saying the incantation, even though it backfired due to him using a broken wand.<ref name=\"CS\"/>\n*'''[[Astronomy]]''': Ron earned on [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] in this subject.<ref name=\"HBP\"/> It is unknown if he was able to continue on to the N.E.W.T. class, seeing as he did not apply for advancement.\n*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': Ron got an 'Exceeds Expectations' on his [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] in the subject.<ref name=\"HBP\"/> He showed talent in handling dangerous [[creature]]s like his brother [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]].\n[[File:Ron playing Quidditch.jpg|thumb|Ron playing Quidditch]]\n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Like his brothers, Ron was excellent at flying. He was good enough to be on the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] and he flew successfully during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]. Ron was a reasonably good Keeper for the team, however his performance sometimes suffered due to his lack of confidence, but overall he was a highly talented [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player. \n*'''Tactical thinking''': Ron was good with tactical thinking and showed a talent for thinking outside of the box. For example, it was Ron who suggested that Harry use [[Felix Felicis]] to try to get [[Horace Slughorn]]'s memory of telling [[Tom Riddle]] about the [[Horcrux]]es,<ref name=\"HBP\" /> and Ron's idea to go to the [[Chamber of Secrets]] in order to get [[Basilisk]] fangs to destroy the Horcruxes.<ref name=\"DH\" /> Ron was also able to keep a level head in highly stressful situations, and was generally more pragmatic than either of his best friends. His knack for strategy allowed him to consistently outclass his peers in both combat and strategy games such as Wizards Chess. His tactical mindset allowed him to recognise Quidditch plays and strategies almost instantly, which is an impressive feat, given that Quidditch is a sport with a three-dimensional playing field.\n*'''Impersonation''': Ron was clever at imitating voices. While at Malfoy Manor, he was able to convincingly imitate Peter Pettigrew to avoid arousing the suspicions of Bellatrix and the Malfoys. He was also able to mimic Parseltongue effectively, which is a rather difficult language to learn or even imitate, enough to open the [[Chamber of Secrets]] after previously hearing Harry do it.\n*'''Leadership skills''': While it was mostly Harry or Hermione who did the leading, Ron also had relatively good leadership skills as he took charge of the Wizard's Chess obstacle during their search for the Philosophers Stone and ordered Harry and Hermione to continue searching for it when he decided to become a sacrifice in the end. He later formed and co-lead Dumbledores Army alongside Harry and Hermione, and temporarily lead their Horcrux hunt when Harry briefly fell into depression over his obsession for the Deathly Hallows. After the war ended, his leadership skills were again shown when he, Harry and Hermione helped to reform the Auror department and Ministry of Magic, and help reduce the prejudice towards non-pure bloods and other underprivileged magical creatures, and when he co owned Weasley Wizard Wheezes afterwards alongside George Weasley.\n*'''Business''': As Ron co-owned [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] alongside his brother George after leaving his profession as an Auror, he likely developed good business skills as he helped turn the business into a big \"money-spinner\" and helped George run it after Fred's death.\n\n==Possessions==\n{{Quote|You never get anything new, either, with five brothers.

Scabbers was already very old when Ron got it, and even if Ron complained about it all the time, saying that Scabbers was useless, he got angry when it seemed that [[Crookshanks]] ate the rat.

Although he was sometimes embarrassed by their lack of money, Ron was fiercely protective of his siblings, and always stoutly defended his parents. He was outraged when his brother [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] called their [[Arthur Weasley|father]] a failure and greatly upset their [[Molly Weasley|mother]] with his estrangement, as Ron was close to both of his parents.<ref name=\"OOTP\" />\n\nRon looked up to his older brothers [[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]], though their accomplishments also made him feel insecure about what he had to live up to.<ref name=\"PS\" /> Percy tried to be a role model for Ron, but Ron considered him rather pompous and annoying, and took after [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]] more in terms of personality. Notably, Ron was the only family member Percy contacted after his estrangement from his family, congratulating Ron on becoming a prefect and advising him to cut ties with Harry, even though Ron was further disgusted by Percy's estrangement.<ref name=\"OOTP\" /> Once he reconciled with his family, Percy was also the one who comforted Ron over Fred's death during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].<ref name=\"DH\" /> The twins delighted in teasing Ron, as did his younger sister [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], though they were all close. Ron was very protective of Ginny, particularly in disapproving of her love life, which sometimes led to them fighting.<ref name=\"HBP\" />\n\nOther relatives of Ron were [[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]] and [[Gideon Prewett]], who were his uncles and members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. During the [[First Wizarding War]], the brothers were attacked by five [[Death Eaters]], including [[Antonin Dolohov]]. Both were killed in battle and were described as having \"''fought like heroes''.\"\n\nAfter the [[Second Wizarding War]], Ron's family was extended when four of his siblings were married and had children. He also had two children with [[Hermione Granger]], [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]], and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]] Weasley.\n\n====Harry Potter====\n{{Quote|If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!|Ron's loyalty to Harry|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}\n\n[[File:Harry Potter.jpg|thumb|[[Harry Potter]], his best friend and future brother-in-law]]\n\nHarry Potter had been Ron's best friend since [[1991]]. The two were as close as brothers, as the Weasleys became like a surrogate family to Harry soon after the pair met on the [[Hogwarts Express]] at the start of their first year. They took to each other immediately, bonding over the vast array of wizarding sweets Harry happily shared with Ron, who was not able to afford his own from the Hogwarts Express [[Trolley witch|food trolley]]. When [[Draco Malfoy]] spoke disparagingly of Ron's family, Harry rejected Draco's offer of friendship in favour of Ron's. Both Ron and Harry were [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into Gryffindor and therefore shared a dormitory. Ron defended Harry from fellow classmates and even Professor Snape.\n\nLike all real brothers, Harry and Ron occasionally fought, especially when Ron's insecurities got the best of him. When Harry was chosen by the [[Goblet of Fire]] as Champion for the [[Triwizard Tournament]], Ron believed Harry had indeed cheated to get into the contest. The two briefly fell out, but the friendship was repaired after the Tournament's First Task, when Ron realised that Harry could possibly lose his life to an event he had genuinely not wanted to enter.<ref name=\"GOF\" />\n\n[[File:Tumblr_my6tk9mIK81rjyrpro8_250.gif|250px|left|frame|Harry and Ron reunite before the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]]]\n\nThe two had another falling out in [[1997]], when the negative energy in [[Slytherin's Locket|Salazar Slytherin's Locket]] affected Ron to the point of making him resentful of Harry and unreasonably jealous of Harry's relationship with [[Hermione Granger]], their other best friend and Ron's love interest. Ron temporarily abandoned his friends, though he instantly regretted it, and returned to save Harry's life.<ref name=\"DH\" /> By and large, Ron was always fiercely loyal to Harry and risked life and limb on countless occasions for him. Even in 2020, Ron tried to prevent Harry from being transfigured into Voldemort due he didn't want Harry to be affected by his trauma. The two eventually became brothers-in-law when Harry married [[Ginevra Weasley|Ron's sister]]. Ron was the uncle of Harry's three children, and was godfather to Harry and Ginny's son [[James Potter II|James]]. Since the two became Aurors, it is likely that they worked together later in life.\n\n====Hermione Granger====\n{{Quote|Oh, maybe she and Ron will be alright with a bit of counselling, you know.

From the time Ron first met Hermione on the [[Hogwarts Express]] at the start of their first year, he found her annoying for \"''showing off''\" and regularly reciting the school's rules. His first thought was that he didn't want to be in her house and he groaned when she was Sorted into Gryffindor. Later on, he informed others of his annoyance with her, and mentioned that it was unsurprising that she didn't have any friends, which she overheard. Hurt, Hermione hid in the bathroom, crying, until Harry and Ron saved her from a troll that had been let into Hogwarts by [[Quirinus Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]]. Following the troll incident, Hermione lied to [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] to prevent Harry and Ron from getting into trouble.<ref name=\"PS\" /> From that time onwards, the trio were best friends, in spite of Ron and Hermione's tendency to bicker.\n\nRon first began showing signs of romantic interest in Hermione in their [[1992|second year]]; he was irritated by her crush on [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], became so angry that [[Draco Malfoy]] called her a \"[[Mudblood]]\" that he tried to hex him, and was even more upset than Harry when she became one of the victims of the [[Serpent of Slytherin|basilisk]].<ref name=\"CS\" /> In their third year, Ron and Hermione had their first real fight, when Ron accused Hermione's cat [[Crookshanks]] of eating his pet rat [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]], which had gone missing.\n\nThe two stopped speaking to each other for a time, but made up after [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] scolded Ron and Harry for their treatment of Hermione; Ron offered to help her with [[Buckbeak]]'s trial, and Hermione hugged him. Also in their third year during their [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class when Professor Lupin was \"[[Werewolf|ill]]\" and [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] was teaching instead, Ron was the only person that had enough courage to go as far as standing up to Snape when he called Hermione an \"''insufferable know-it-all''\".<ref name=\"POA\">{{POA}}</ref>\n\nIn their fourth year, Ron and Hermione's romantic feelings for one another began to grow and become more obvious. Hermione was jealous of Ron's crush on [[Fleur Delacour]], the [[Half-Veela|part-Veela]] champion from [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]], and Ron became jealous of [[Viktor Krum]], with whom Hermione attended the [[Yule Ball]] after Ron failed to ask her in time and then offended her with his clumsy attempt to do so. Though they rowed heatedly over Hermione seeing Krum, their friendship only suffered slight strain.<ref name=\"GOF\" /> Hermione's frustration over Ron's failure to realise and act on his feelings continued into their fifth year, as she commented that he had \"''the emotional range of a teaspoon''\". Ron was visibly affected when Hermione kissed him on the cheek before his first [[Quidditch]] game and irked that Hermione maintained a correspondence with Viktor Krum.<ref name=\"OOTP\" />\n\n[[File:Hermione and Ron kissing in the Chamber of Secrets.gif|250px|left|frame|Ron and Hermione kiss in the Chamber of Secrets]]\n\nTheir sixth year would be a trying time for Ron and Hermione. When Hermione and Harry were invited to the [[Slug Club]], while [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] ignored Ron, Ron became resentful and jealous. He brightened up considerably after Hermione asked him to go to Slughorn's Christmas party with her. However, Ron had a row with [[Ginevra Weasley|his sister]] after catching her snogging [[Dean Thomas]], during which she revealed that Hermione had snogged [[Viktor Krum]] sometime during their fourth year. Ron started acting coldly towards Hermione, much to her bewilderment. \n\nIn an attempt to boost Ron's confidence for an upcoming Quidditch match, Harry pretended to slip him some [[Felix Felicis]] in Ron's morning pumpkin juice, giving Ron the desired placebo effect that kept his nerves from hindering his performance as a [[Keeper]]. Harry had managed to trick Hermione into thinking he had given Ron a drop of the Felix Felicis as well, and she berated both Harry and Ron for taking an unfair advantage in the game. Though Ron had initially believed the Felix was behind his flawless performance, when Harry revealed he had not actually slipped anything in Ron's drink, Ron accused Hermione of not having faith in his abilities and thenceforth started ignoring her completely.\n\n[[File:DH1 Ron and Hermione picking up stones.jpg|250px|thumb|Ron teaching Hermione how to skip rocks]]\n\nAll this caused Ron to begin a shallow relationship with [[Lavender Brown]]. Hermione was hurt and furious, [[Bird-Conjuring Charm|conjuring a flock of canaries]] to attack Ron, after which the two did not speak for months. Hermione even retaliated by attending the aforementioned Christmas party with [[Cormac McLaggen]], an older [[Gryffindor]] whom Ron despised, simply to annoy Ron. By this time, Ron was already growing tired of his relationship with the very clingy Lavender. \n\nWhen Ron was accidentally poisoned with mead on his birthday, Hermione forgot her anger in her worry for him, staying by his side until he recovered. Ron looked forward to these visits from her while pretending to be asleep whenever Lavender visited him. By the time Ron was allowed to leave the [[Hospital Wing]], he and Hermione were closer than ever, and the former's romance with Lavender ended quickly when Lavender saw Ron and Hermione coming down from the boys' dormitories together, while Harry was with them under his [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]]. At the end of the year, their mutual affection was visible when Ron gently comforted Hermione as she cried on his shoulder at Dumbledore's funeral.<ref name=\"HBP\" /> \n\nAfterwards, the two grew much closer, though were only \"''sort of''\" together, according to Harry. They danced together at [[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]], where Ron also showed his continuing jealous dislike of Viktor Krum, who was a guest. During the hunt for the [[Horcrux]]es with Harry, Ron comforted Hermione several times by putting his arm around her, and the two were generally kinder to one another; Harry even suspected that they had fallen asleep in [[12 Grimmauld Place]] holding hands after waking up and noticing that their hands were barely an inch away from each other.\n\n[[File:Tumblr_luvo6cY9NJ1qili3vo1_500.gif|250px|thumb|left|Ron and Hermione fell asleep hand-in-hand in [[12 Grimmauld Place]]]]\n\nWhen Remus Lupin informed them of the Ministry's crack down on Muggle-borns, Ron offered to vouch for her by telling people that Hermione was his cousin, at which Hermione affectionately touched his hand and reminded him that they were on the run with the most wanted wizard in Britain. When Ron temporarily left his friends, Hermione cried over him for weeks; Ron was able to return by hearing Hermione's voice saying his name through his [[Deluminator]]. When Ron destroyed the [[Slytherin's Locket|locket Horcrux]], it taunted him with visions of his greatest fears, one of which was Hermione preferring Harry to him. Hermione was initially furious with Ron for his abandonment, to the point of physically attacking him, though she eventually forgave him.\n\nLater on, when the trio was brought to [[Malfoy Manor]], [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] isolated Hermione for interrogation by the means of torture. Ron begged in vain to be taken in her stead, and after being thrown into the basement, Hermione's screams from above caused Ron to call her name in anguish, eventually reducing him to tears. During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Hermione was touched when Ron expressed concern for the castle's [[house-elf|house-elves]], for whom she had always been concerned, and initiated a kiss, to which Ron responded very enthusiastically.<ref name=\"DH\" />\n\nSometime after the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Ron and Hermione married and had two children, [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]].<ref name=\"DHE\" />They were rather young when they married, as noted by Ron in 2020. His nephew, Albus, noted that Ron was rather openly affectionate towards his wife and was known to kiss her in public rather frequently. At this time Ron proposed to Hermione again after reading about renewing wedding vows, showing that Ron had become rather romantic as he matured, which made Hermione melt, deeply touched by her husband's romantic gesture and agreeing on the spot to it. This shows hows Ron and Hermione's relationship had evolved and much of their bickering subsiding a bit for a more gentle marriage, yet still rife with their uniquely combative and verbally alarming undertones to it.\n\n====Children====\n{{Quote|Don't get too friendly with him, though, Rosie.

As Rose was preparing to leave for her first year at Hogwarts in 2017, Ron jokingly told her that if she wasn't in [[Gryffindor]] he'd disinherit her. He also told her to beat [[Draco Malfoy]]'s son [[Scorpius Malfoy]] on their tests, and that he was grateful she had inherited her [[Hermione Granger|mother]]'s brains.\n\nRon's daughter Rose was close in age to Harry and Ginny's younger son [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus]], while Ron's son Hugo was close in age to Harry and Ginny's daughter, [[Lily L.

Bill and Fleur had three children: [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]], [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]], and [[Louis Weasley|Louis]]. Percy and his wife, [[Audrey Weasley|Audrey,]] had two daughters, [[Molly Weasley II|Molly]] (after [[Molly Weasley|Ron's mother]]) and [[Lucy Weasley|Lucy]].

However, after the the second task in the [[Triwizard Tournament|Tournament]], when Harry \"saved\" Fleur's younger sister, [[Gabrielle Delacour|Gabrielle]] from the [[Great Lake|Black Lake]], Fleur treated both Harry and Ron (whom she believed helped Harry save Gabrielle) much more warmly. Following the death of [[Cedric Diggory]] and the end of the Tournament, Fleur kissed Ron and Harry and said goodbye to them before she left. After the Tournament, Fleur started dating Ron's brother, [[William Weasley|Bill]]. Bill sent her to live with his family for a few days, so that she could become more familiar with them. Ron told Harry that it was difficult to get used to her visiting when she kept appearing suddenly, leaving Ron in a sort-of trance.\n\nFleur eventually married Bill, and they lived at their own house, [[Shell Cottage]]. While Ron was looking for [[Horcrux]]es, he abandoned Harry and Hermione temporarily after they fought and spent that time at Shell Cottage with Bill and Fleur. Ron went to Shell Cottage again, after the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]], and Fleur cared for him and his friends like a mother.\n\nEventually, Ron and Fleur fought alongside each other and survived the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].\n\n===Neville Longbottom===\n{{Quote|No, you're not.

Neville was shy and nervous, and regularly found himself being bullied by [[Slytherin]] students, like [[Draco Malfoy]]. Ron encouraged Neville to be more confident and to stand up for himself, and the two became close friends. Both Ron and Neville became members of [[Dumbledore's Army]] in 1995, and fought together in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] in 1996, and the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] in [[1997]].\n\nRon was shocked when he learned that Neville's parents were patients at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], having been tortured to the point of insanity by [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]], [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], [[Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus]], and [[Rabastan Lestrange]], and sympathised with his friend.\n\nWhile Ron, Harry and Hermione left Hogwarts to find Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es, Neville led [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], [[Luna Lovegood]] and several other students in reviving Dumbledore's Army and maintaining a steady opposition against the new Headmaster [[Severus Snape]] and professors [[Amycus Carrow|Amycus]] and [[Alecto Carrow]]. Neville was adamant that the rest of the DA be included in whatever Ron, Harry and Hermione were doing to bring down [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], and he fought together with them in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], ultimately beheading Nagini with the [[Sword of Gryffindor]] and destroying the last remaining Horcrux. Together, Ron and Neville took down [[Fenrir Greyback]].\n\nAfter the [[Second Wizarding War]], Ron and Neville remained close and saw each other regularly, as Neville was appointed [[Herbology]] professor at Hogwarts, and taught [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Ron's daughter]] in 2017.\n\n===Draco Malfoy===\n{{Quote|Think my name's funny, do you?

Upon meeting Ron on the [[Hogwarts Express]] at the beginning of their first year, Draco Malfoy immediately expressed his disdain for the Weasleys. He was further irritated when Harry turned down his offer of friendship in favour of Ron's.<ref name=\"PS\" /> Like their fathers, [[Arthur Weasley]] and [[Lucius Malfoy]], Ron and Draco despised each other and frequently exchanged insults.\n\nIn their second year, Ron tried to hex Draco to vomit slugs after he called Hermione a \u201c''filthy little [[Mudblood]]''\u201d, but the charm backfired due to a broken wand. He also attempted to physically attack him after Draco expressed a wish that Hermione was killed rather than [[petrification|petrified]] during the [[Chamber of Secrets]] affair.<ref name=\"CS\" /> In their fourth year, Ron was immensely amused when [[Alastor Moody]] ([[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] in disguise) [[Transfiguration|transfigured]] Draco into a ferret.

Ron discouraged his daughter [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] from becoming \"too friendly\" with Draco's son [[Scorpius Malfoy|Scorpius]].<ref name=\"DH\" /> In 2020, it is shown Ron is slightly annoyed with Draco becoming friendly with Harry, and even cited that despite this he still disliked him. Nevertheless, he admitted that he felt sorry for Draco for the loss of Astoria, showing that despite their mutual enmity, even Ron in the end was not entirely without empathy for him.\n\n===Luna Lovegood===\n{{Quote|You know, she's grown on me, Luna.

She found him very funny, but Ron suspected she was making fun of him when she laughed uproariously at a joke he made. After getting to know her better through [[Dumbledore's Army]], Ron gradually became fonder of Luna, especially after she was one of the only D.A. members to come to the trio's assistance when they ventured to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries|a battle]] ensued, during which Luna protected a [[Confundus Charm|cursed]] Ron and his injured [[Ginevra Weasley|sister]].<ref name=\"OOTP\" /> \n\nRon was very amused when Luna commentated on a [[Quidditch]] match the [[1997|following year]], and when she danced by herself at the wedding of his older brother [[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Fleur Delacour]].

Although he was not as close to them as he was to Harry, Ron was nevertheless friendly with both of them. When he and Harry had a falling out over the [[Goblet of Fire]] drawing Harry's name, Ron spent a lot of time with Seamus and Dean.<ref name=\"GOF\" />\n\nRon stood up for Harry against Seamus when he and Harry argued about [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s return.

Dean, like Ron, Harry and Hermione, left Hogwarts in [[1997]], because it was supposed that he was a [[Muggle-born]]. He was caught by a group of [[Snatchers]], led by [[Fenrir Greyback]], along with Ron, Harry and Hermione. They escaped from [[Malfoy Manor]], where they had gone, and lived for a few days at [[Shell Cottage]].\n\nSeamus and Dean eventually fought along with Ron in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].\n\n===Scabbers/Peter Pettigrew===\n{{Quote|I let you sleep in my bed!|Ron disgusted at Peter Pettigrew|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}\n\n[[File:Wormtail_DH1.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Pettigrew]], his once pet]]\n\nScabbers was an unusually old and scraggly-looking rat that originally belonged to [[Percy Weasley]], but was passed down to Ron when Percy was given [[Hermes]]. At first, Ron showed little outward affection for Scabbers, as the rat was uninteresting and one of Ron's many hand-me-downs. However, Ron later demonstrated that he genuinely cared for the rat; he was so devastated when Scabbers disappeared during the 1993\u20131994 school year that he nearly ended his friendship with [[Hermione Granger]], believing her cat, [[Crookshanks]], had eaten Scabbers. Ron was clearly overjoyed when they later discovered Scabbers hiding in Rubeus Hagrid's cabin. When [[Sirius Black]] and [[Remus Lupin]] revealed that Scabbers was actually an [[Animagus]] named Peter Pettigrew, Ron refused to believe it until they forced the rat to transform back into his human form. Ron took this revelation as a personal insult, and refused to listen to Pettigrew's pleas for mercy.\n\nIn [[1998]], Ron, Harry, and Hermione were captured and imprisoned in the cellar of [[Malfoy Manor]]. When the house-elf [[Dobby]] came to rescue them, Peter was sent to investigate the noise. Harry and Ron ambushed Pettigrew, and Ron took his wand. Harry reminded Pettigrew of the life-debt he owed Harry when Pettigrew tried to strangle him, and Peter momentarily loosened his grip. However, the [[Peter Pettigrew's silver hand|silver hand]] given to Peter by Voldemort turned on him instead, and, despite Harry and Ron's attempts to save him, Pettigrew was killed for showing the slightest bit of mercy. Ron subsequently gained possession of [[Peter Pettigrew's second wand|Pettigrew's wand]].

Hagrid was very fond of Harry, Ron and Hermione, regularly inviting them to his hut for tea. Though all three returned Hagrid's affections, Ron was openly incredulous of Hagrid's [[love]] of dangerous [[Creature]]s, and was furious with Hagrid after his pet [[Acromantula]], [[Aragog]], and Aragog's family tried to eat him and Harry. During Ron's fourth year, it was revealed to the [[wizarding world]] that Hagrid was a [[half-giant]], and Hagrid consequently received a good deal of hate mail, which led to his self-imposed seclusion within his hut. Through the efforts of Ron, Harry, Hermione and [[Albus Dumbledore]], Hagrid became convinced that people still loved him and wanted him around.\n\nRon and Hagrid also fought alongside one another in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] and in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

In [[1997]], when Harry fought with Remus for attempting to temporarily leave his pregnant [[Nymphadora Tonks|wife]] to aid Harry, Ron, and Hermione in their mission, Ron expressed his disappointment in the way Harry handled the situation, despite agreeing with the point Harry was trying to make.\n\nRon and Lupin fought alongside each other in the: [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], the [[Attack at the Burrow]], and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], where Remus was murdered by [[Antonin Dolohov]].

I mean, they've got all the Muggles looking out for him too....|Ron about Sirius Black after he escaped from prison|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}\n\n[[File:Sirius_Black_Profile.JPG|thumb|left|[[Sirius Black]], his best friend's godfather]] \n\nRon first learned about Sirius Black in [[1993]], when the latter became the first wizard to escape from [[Azkaban]], and was believed to be planning to track down and kill Harry at Hogwarts. As it turned out, Sirius was actually after Ron's pet rat, who was actually the [[Animagus]] [[Peter Pettigrew]] in disguise. At the end of their third year, Ron, Harry and Hermione learned that Sirius was not only innocent of the crime of betraying [[Lily J. Potter|Lily]] and [[James Potter I|James Potter]] to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], but that he was, in fact, Harry's godfather. After revealing Pettigrew's true form, Sirius felt responsible for Ron's loss of \"''Scabbers'',\" and gave him an owl as replacement. During their fourth year Ron along with Harry and Hermione provided food for Sirius, who was hiding in a cave outside of Hogsmeade.\n\nDuring the [[Second Wizarding War]], Ron and Sirius bonded during their time cooped up at [[12 Grimmauld Place]], and Ron defended Sirius against all of Hermione's critical remarks about Sirius's selfish treatment of Harry as a friend rather than a godson, as well as her belief that Sirius was trying to live vicariously through Harry, Ron, and herself.\n\n===Minerva McGonagall===\n{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Professor McGonagall|You'd better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley, you're bleeding.|Ron Weasley|Not much. Professor, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted \u2014|The Sorting Ceremony is over. Your sister is also in Gryffindor.|Oh, good.|Professor McGonagall to Ron Weasley at the beginning of the [[1992\u20131993 school year]]|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\n\n[[File:600full-harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-photo.jpg|thumb|[[Minerva McGonagall]], his head of house and professor]]\n\nMinerva McGonagall was the [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] Professor and [[Gryffindor]] [[Head of House]] during Ron's time at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. She was very strict, and regularly reprimanded Ron, Harry and Hermione for the many instances they ended up bending or outright breaking school rules. However, she was just and impartial as a disciplinarian, and always acted in the best interest of all Hogwarts students, often showing lenience and understanding where it was deserved. She clearly cared about Ron, as she cared about all of her students, and Ron fought alongside McGonagall during the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], both surviving the [[Second Wizarding War]].\n\n===Nymphadora Tonks===\n{{Dialogue a-b|Ron|Listen, no bloke in his right mind's going to fancy Tonks when Fleur's around. I mean, Tonks is okay-looking when she isn't doing stupid things to her hair and her nose, but ''[...]'' |Ginny Weasley|She's a damn sight nicer than [[Fleur Delacour|Phlegm]]!|Ron and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] comparing Tonks and Fleur|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\n\n[[File:Nymphadora Tonks DH promo headshot .jpg|thumb|left|[[Nymphadora Tonks]], his friend]]\n\nNymphadora Tonks was a young witch, a [[metamorphmagus]], and an [[Auror]]. Ron met Tonks in [[1995]], when both became members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. Ron generally liked Tonks and found her amusing, despite at one point comparing her looks unfavourably to Fleur Delacour's. Saying that she was merely okay looking \"''when not doing stupid stuff to her nose and hair''\". He also mentioned that she was not as much of laugh anymore as she was starting to \"''look more and more like [[Myrtle Warren|Moaning Myrtle]]''\".\n\nTonks and Ron fought alongside each other during the: [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] (where they were paired together), the [[Attack at the Burrow]], and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], where Tonks was murdered by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. Ron was devastated by her death and after the war, he became a friend of Tonks's son, [[Edward Lupin|Teddy]]. It can also be assumed that he was around Teddy often, seeing as his best friend was Teddy's godfather.\n\n===Severus Snape===\n{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione Granger|How many times have you suspected Snape, and when have you ever been right? Dumbledore trusts him, he works for the Order, that ought to be enough.|Ron|He used to be a Death Eater. And we've never seen proof that he really swapped sides.|Ron's mistrust towards Snape|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n\n[[File:Severus Snape Profile.jpg|thumb|[[Severus Snape]], his professor]]\n\nSeverus Snape was the [[Potions Master]] and [[Head of Slytherin House]] during Ron's time at Hogwarts. He made no attempt to hide his preference for his own House, nor his disdain for the [[Gryffindor]] students, and showed particular dislike for both Ron and Hermione as Harry's best friends. Ron believed that Snape, who was a former Death Eater, had never truly joined their side, and that he was still working as a double agent for Voldemort. During his fifth year, Ron suggested that Snape was trying to open Harry's mind to Voldemort rather than close it during Harry's [[Occlumency]] lessons.\n\nIn [[1997]], Ron fought in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], after which he learned that Snape had killed [[Albus Dumbledore]], and a few months later, during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], Snape accidentally cursed off George Weasley's ear, while aiming a ''[[Sectumsempra]]'' at a Death Eater who was poised to kill [[Remus Lupin]]. Ron, like most of the Order and Hogwarts staff, viewed Snape as a cowardly, heartless murderer. However, Ron witnessed Snape's [[death]] as ordered by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], and eventually learned that Snape had been working for their side all along, at great personal risk. It was likely that Ron came to appreciate Snape's unwavering bravery.\n\n===Albus Dumbledore===\n{{Quote|Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker all right!|Ron's own unique compliment of Dumbledore|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}\n\n[[File:Albus_Dumbledore_HBP.jpg|thumb|left|[[Albus Dumbledore]], his headmaster]]\n\nRon was raised within the [[wizarding world]], and knew of Albus Dumbledore, [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] headmaster and probably the greatest wizard of the time, since childhood. Ron met Dumbledore when he first attended Hogwarts in [[1991]]. Although Ron never spent much, if any, one-on-one time with Dumbledore, it was clear that Dumbledore trusted Ron, along with Hermione, and valued their individual skills. He felt Ron and Hermione could be trusted to aid Harry in his mission to destroy Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es, the existence of which was a secret of vital importance unknown to a living a soul aside from the trio, Dumbledore, and Voldemort himself.\n\nAfter Dumbledore's death, it was discovered that the Headmaster had bequeathed Ron his [[Deluminator]]. Unknown to Ron at the time he received it, the Deluminator had the magical ability to return Ron to his friends if the time came, as Dumbledore had anticipated, when Ron would part ways with Harry and Hermione during their quest. The Deluminator's function as a homing device for Ron's friends suggested that Dumbledore understood Ron well enough to know that as surely as he would struggle with the mission, he would be just as certain to want to return to his friends' sides.\n\nIn return, Ron admired Dumbledore for his extraordinary magical prowess and intelligence greatly and felt a great amount of respect for him. During Dumbledore's funeral, Ron was clearly distraught as Dumbledore's body was laid to rest. This respect clearly became greater than ever when Ron realised that Dumbledore valued him as Harry's friend enough to give him the Deluminator, showing great appreciation and gratitude for the Headmaster's trust in him. Due to his pragmatism, he is entirely unaffected by the revelation of Dumbledore's past with Gellert Grindelwald whereas even Hermione could not help but be deeply shocked by it, believing it only happened because Dumbledore was still growing up at that age and defending him from Harry when he mentioned about it.\n\nRon, along with Hermione and Harry, visited [[Albus Dumbledore's portrait|Dumbledore's portrait]] after the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] to discuss the fate of the [[Deathly Hallows]].\n\n===Lavender Brown===\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Ron|I love you, Hermione.|Hermione Granger|Don't let Lavender hear you saying that.|I won't. Or maybe I will...then she'll ditch me...|Ron and Hermione discussing Ron's relationship with Lavender|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\n\n[[File:Lavender Brown 1997.jpg|thumb|[[Lavender Brown]], his ex-girlfriend]]\n\nLavender Brown, a [[Gryffindor]] in Ron's year, developed a crush on him when they entered their [[1996|sixth year]]. At first, Ron seemed vaguely flattered, but not particularly interested in Lavender's flirtatious behaviour. However, after becoming angry with Hermione and being taunted by Ginny over his lack of romantic experience, Ron began an exhibitionist relationship with Lavender. The couple was frequently seen snogging in public, much to the disgust of a jealous and hurt Hermione as well as Ginny, who considered him a \"''filthy hypocrite''\" because he insulted her for being caught kissing [[Dean Thomas|her boyfriend]] earlier in the year. Lavender threw herself into the relationship almost obsessively, alarming even her best friend, [[Parvati Patil]]. Lavender called Ron by the annoying nickname of \"Won-Won\", pressed Harry for details of Ron's feelings for her, and gave him a necklace with the words 'my sweetheart' for [[Christmas]]. After that Christmas, Lavender tickled Ron, and was noticed by Harry. Ron found these traits irritating, and admitted to Harry that the relationship consisted of little talking and mostly snogging.\n\n[[File:Tumblr_m99kguTpmB1qfjd5ao1_250.gif|250px|thumb|left|Ron and Lavender kissing or \"snogging\"]] \n\nBy [[1 March|his birthday]], Ron was unhappy in the relationship; he feigned sleep whenever Lavender visited him in the infirmary after his poisoning and said Hermione's name in his sleep. He was spared the task of breaking up with Lavender when she became suspicious that something was going on between him and Hermione, and ended the romance. Ron was happy to see things finished, though he felt guilty for it, but Lavender was upset for some time afterwards. It is unknown how Ron reacted to Lavender's death in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. It can assumed that he was saddened by it, as they were once friends.\n\n===Viktor Krum===\n{{Quote|Hasn't he asked you to call him Vicky yet?|Ron jealously mocking [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s relationship with Viktor Krum|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\n[[File:Goffilm39.1.jpg|thumb|[[Viktor Krum]], his rival]]\nRon was a huge fan of Viktor Krum, as he was the [[Seeker]] for the [[Bulgarian National Quidditch team]], enthusiastic to the point of purchasing a miniature Krum figurine at the [[Quidditch World Cup]] and bringing it with him to school. However, his feelings changed markedly when Krum began seeing [[Hermione Granger]] and the two attended the [[Yule Ball]] together in [[1994]]. Despite his jealousy, Ron asked Krum for his autograph following the end of the [[Triwizard Tournament]], much to Krum's surprise and Hermione's amusement. During Ron's sixth year, he discovered that Hermione had \"snogged\" Krum in the course of their brief romance, which caused Ron's jealousy of Krum to resurge. He expressed these feelings in [[1997]], at Bill and Fleur's wedding, when Krum's appearance as a guest inspired Ron to whisk Hermione away to dance.\n\n===Pigwidgeon===\n{{Quote|I've got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes. He annoys me too, come to that.|Ron regarding his pet owl|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}\n\nPigwidgeon became Ron's owl in [[1994]]. He was given to Ron by [[Sirius Black]], as Sirius felt partially responsible for the loss of Ron's pet rat, who turned out to be the [[Animagus]] and [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], [[Peter Pettigrew]], in disguise. Initially, Ron loved him, and enjoyed having an owl of his own, but Pig, as Ron preferred to call him, turned out to be very tiny and hyperactive, and became mainly annoying to Ron (as [[Errol]] and [[Hermes]], according to Ron) and had to be kept away from them. It can be assumed that deep down Ron still loved Pigwidgeon considering that before he found out the truth about Peter Pettigrew he still loved \"Scabbers\" despite complaining about his uselessness nonstop.<ref name=\"POA\"/> \n\n===Crookshanks===\n{{Dialogue a-b-a-b-a|Ron Weasley|OY! GET OFF, YOU STUPID ANIMAL!|Hermione Granger|Ron, don't hurt him!|CATCH THAT CAT! Look at him! He's skin and bone! You keep that cat away from him!|Crookshanks doesn't understand it's wrong!

It heard me say that Scabbers was in my bag!|Ron's inital dislike of Hermione's cat|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}[[File:CrookshanksPottermore.png|thumb|left|Crookshanks]]\nCrookshanks was [[Hermione Granger]]'s large, bandy-legged, ginger-coloured, half-[[Kneazle]] [[cat]]. Ron strongly disliked him at first, largely due to his antagonistic behaviour towards Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. In [[1993]], Scabbers, who was actually the [[Animagus]], [[Peter Pettigrew]], faked his own death for the second time after Sirius Black escaped from [[Azkaban]]. Ron initially believed Scabbers had been eaten by Crookshanks, and he nearly ended his friendship with Hermione.<ref name=\"POA\"/>\n\nWhen Ron discovered the truth about Scabbers, and found that Crookshanks had been helping Sirius all along, he seemed to appreciate Crookshanks as a good judge of character, and even half-jokingly asked the cat if [[Pigwidgeon]] was really an owl.<ref name=\"POA\"/> When Crookshanks meowed happily, Ron actually seemed relieved. It is unknown if Ron ever saw Crookshanks after the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], since he had been left at [[the Burrow]] during Bill and Fleur's wedding.\n\n===Cormac McLaggen===\n\n{{Quote|Well, good luck. Hope you hammer McLag \u2014 I mean, [[Zacharias Smith|Smith]].|Ron to [[Harry Potter]] before a [[Quidditch]] match|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\n\n[[File:Mclaggen.jpg|thumb|[[Cormac McLaggen]], his rival]]\n\nIn [[1996]], Ron's competition for the [[Keeper]] position on the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] was Cormac McLaggen, a [[Gryffindor]] a year above him. Before the try-outs, Hermione overheard McLaggen insulting Ron and Ginny, and placed a [[Confundus Charm]] on him that made him miss his last save. Ron thus beat him, though McLaggen claimed that this was due to favouritism. Ron greatly disliked him, which prompted Hermione to attend [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]'s Christmas party with him to retaliate against Ron for his romance with [[Lavender Brown]]. Ron disliked McLaggen even more, and was happy when his date with Hermione did not go well, and when McLaggen did not perform well as replacement keeper while Ron was in the [[Hospital Wing]].<ref name=\"HBP\" />\n\n===Dolores Umbridge===\n{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Hermione Granger|She's an awful woman, awful. You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in ... we've got to do something about her.|Ron Weasley|I suggested [[poison]].|No ...

She was a sadistic, very unpleasant woman who derived great satisfaction from torturing students as punishment (most notably, forcing [[Harry Potter]] to carve the words \"''I must not tell lies''\" into the back of his own hand, using a [[Black Quill|Blood Quill]]). Ron, like most of the students and faculty at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], greatly disliked her intrusive, hypocritical and often outright insulting ways, in return Umbridge disliked Ron, as he was a main offender of the rules and loyal to Harry and a member of Dumbledore's Army. She had an obsession with pure-blood status and both hated and feared people she called ''[[half-breed]]s'', like [[centaur]]s and [[half-giant]]s. She also hated [[Muggle-born]]s, and probably half-bloods, despite being half-blood herself. In the end of the year, she was attacked by a group of centaurs and eventually brought to the [[Hospital Wing]] by [[Albus Dumbledore]]. Though she attempted to abscond, [[Peeves]] the [[Poltergeist]] discovered her sneaking away, and led the students in driving her out Hogwarts.\n\nRon met again Umbridge in [[1997]], when he was disguised as [[Reginald Cattermole|Reg Cattermole]], a Ministry official, and while Umbridge was in charge of trying Muggle-borns before they were sent to [[Azkaban]]. Harry stunned Umbridge during the interrogation of [[Mary Cattermole]], when Umbridge attempted to flaunt [[Slytherin's Locket|Salazar Slytherin's Locket]] as proof of her relation to the [[Selwyn family]]. After Hermione retrieved the locket and replaced it with a decoy using the [[Doubling Charm|Geminio]] curse, Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded to help the Muggle-borns awaiting trial escape from the Ministry. After the Second Wizarding War, Umbridge herself was imprisoned in Azkaban for life.\n\n===Ghosts===\n{{Dialogue a-b|Moaning Myrtle|Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me.|Ron|But, it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it would just go right through you.|An example of Ron's unintentional insensitivity to [[ghost]]s|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}\n\n[[File:Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington.png|thumb|[[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]]]]\n\nRon's lack of sensitivity causes him to be unpopular with the Hogwarts ghosts, namely Nearly Headless Nick and [[Myrtle Warren|Moaning Myrtle]]. Ron first met Nearly Headless Nick in [[1991]] during his first welcoming feast. He knew Nick because he heard [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]] talking about him. Nick requested that Ron should address him as \"''Sir Nicholas''\" instead of Nearly Headless Nick. During later feasts, Ron would annoy Nick by reminding him he was dead and how much he enjoyed food.\n\nRon met Moaning Myrtle in [[1992]], during the re-opening of the [[Chamber of Secrets]]. Myrtle was upset since [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] had unknowingly thrown [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|a diary]] at her. Ron pointed out that it couldn't hurt Myrtle since she was a ghost, and the book would go through her. Myrtle swooped down on Ron with rage and sarcastically commented that everyone should throw books at her and make a game out of it.\n\n===Lord Voldemort===\n{{Quote|He beat you!|Ron to Voldemort (talking about [[Harry Potter]]) during the Battle of Hogwarts|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}\n\n[[File:Lord Voldemort.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], a hated enemy]]\n\nAs Ron was raised within the [[Weasley family|wizarding world]], he had grown up fearing the name of Lord Voldemort, the most dangerous [[Dark Wizard]] of all time. He was afraid to say the name or even to hear it, and protested when Harry refused to refer to Voldemort as \"You-Know-Who\" or \"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.\" Ron helped Harry protect the [[Philosopher's Stone]] from Voldemort at the end of their first year, when he won a game of Wizard's chess by sacrificing himself. Ron also helped Harry get into the [[Chamber of Secrets]] and save Ron's [[Ginevra Weasley|younger sister]].\n\nRon's fear of saying Voldemort's name ended up being justified and delaying the capture of Harry, Hermione and himself, as he managed to convince Harry and Hermione to refer to Voldemort as \"You-Know-Who\" around the same time saying the name was made [[Taboo]]. In [[1998]], Ron used Godric Gryffindor's sword to destroy [[Slytherin's Locket|Salazar Slytherin's Locket]], one of Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es. The locket tortured Ron, as a \"Riddle-Harry\" and a \"Riddle-Hermione\" appeared, eventually kissing, telling Ron that he was useless, that no woman would choose him over Harry, that his own mother will choose Harry as a son instead of him, and that she wanted a girl when she had him. Ron showed the strength of his personality in by overcoming his insecurities and stabbing the locket with [[Sword of Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor's Sword]], destroying the Horcrux.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Ron was present when Voldemort told the crowd that Harry had been killed while trying to save himself. Forgetting his fear, and breaking the [[Silencing Charm]] Voldemort had placed over the crowd, Ron shouted that Harry had defeated him. Ron also witnessed Voldemort's final duel with Harry.\n\n===Dumbledore's Army===\n{{Dialogue a-b|Neville Longbottom|Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be about doing something real. Or was all that just words to you?|Ron|Maybe you don't have to do this all by yourself, mate.|Ron, along with Neville, shows his loyalty to the Army, and to Harry|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}[[File:Dumbledore's_Army.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Dumbledore's Army]], his friends and allies]]\n\nDumbledore's Army was an organisation led by Harry Potter, in order to oppose [[Dolores Umbridge]], and as a supplementary means of practising [[Defence Against the Dark Arts|defensive magic]]. In [[1995]], Ron and Hermione convinced Harry to teach anyone who was interested about protective spells and counter-jinxes that had helped him survive his many encounters with Voldemort, as the purely theoretical instruction they were receiving from Umbridge was wholly inadequate. Six members of the D.A. fought in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]. In addition to [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]], [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Luna Lovegood]], [[Lavender Brown]], [[Seamus Finnigan]], and [[Dean Thomas]], there were eighteen other known members.\n\nThe [[Gryffindor]] students who were members of the DA included [[Colin and Dennis Creevey]], [[Parvati Patil]], [[Lee Jordan]] (Fred and George Weasley's best friend) [[Alicia Spinnet]] and [[Katie Bell]] (members of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]) and [[Angelina Johnson]] (captain of the Team, and Ron's future sister-in-law, after marrying George). Fred and Colin Creevey were both murdered by [[Death Eaters]] in during the Battle.\n\nThe [[Hufflepuff]] students were [[Hannah Abbott]], [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], [[Susan Bones]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], and [[Zacharias Smith]]. Ron was friendly with all of them, except Zacharias, the only one who didn't fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].\n\nThe [[Ravenclaw]] students were [[Padma Patil]] (Parvati's twin sister), [[Cho Chang]], [[Terry Boot]], [[Anthony Goldstein]], [[Michael Corner]], and [[Marietta Edgecombe]]. Ron attended the [[Yule Ball]] with Padma, who wasn't pleased with Ron's appearance in his tattered dress robes, and Ron wasn't particularly fond of Michael Corner, who was Ginny's ex-boyfriend. They all fought together during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]], with the exception of Marietta, who did not return to Hogwarts at any point.\n\n===Order of the Phoenix===\n{{Dialogue a-b-c|Harry Potter|So what is this place?|Ron|Headquarters.|Hermione Granger|Of the Order of the Phoenix. It's a secret society. Dumbledore formed it back when they first fought You-Know-Who.|Ron and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] explaining to [[Harry Potter|Harry]] the Order|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}\n\n[[File:Order of the Phoenix.png|250px|thumb|The original [[Order of the Phoenix]]]]\n\nThe Order of the Phoenix was an organisation founded and led by [[Albus Dumbledore]]. The Order included Ron's [[Weasley family|family]], [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], [[Rubeus Hagrid]], [[Remus Lupin]], [[Sirius Black]], [[Fleur Delacour]], [[Minerva McGonagall]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]], and [[Severus Snape]] as well as several other notable members of the [[Wizarding world|wizarding community]].\n\nIn [[1994]], for Ron's fourth year at Hogwarts, [[Alastor Moody|Alastor \"Mad Eye\" Moody]], an Auror famous for his great skill, vast experience, and growing paranoia, was appointed professor of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]. Prior to the start of the school year, on [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s orders, Moody was attacked and imprisoned in his own magical trunk by [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]], who impersonated Moody and took his place at Hogwarts by using [[Polyjuice Potion]] until 24 June, [[1995]]. Ron clearly held Moody in high regard, as he looked forward to his classes and persistently hoped that Moody would tell him he would make a good Auror, as he had Harry and Hermione (albeit, it was actually Barty Crouch Jnr who suggested Harry and Hermione consider becoming Aurors). Ron met the real Mad-Eye later in 1995, at [[12 Grimmauld Place]], the headquarters of the Order. Ron and Moody fought alongside one another in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] and in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], where Mad-Eye was killed. Ron, like the other members of the Order, was shocked and devastated by the death of someone as tough and skilled as Moody.\n\nRon was also familiar with the \"''useless git''\" [[Mundungus Fletcher]], an almost grudging member of the Order. Though Ron was initially amused by Mundungus, he quickly grew disgusted with Mundungus's continued general disregard for other people, or their property and safety, particularly when he abandoned Alastor Moody in the midst of the Battle of the Seven Potters. Ron met Mundungus again when he, Harry and Hermione wanted information regarding the whereabouts of [[Slytherin's Locket|Salazar Slytherin's Locket]] and appeared amused by Kreacher's repeated abuse of Fletcher.\n\nWhen Ron, Harry and Hermione apparated into [[Hogsmeade]], intent on sneaking into Hogwarts to find an object that had once belonged to Rowena Ravenclaw, they found themselves in a trap set by [[Death Eaters]]. They were saved by [[Aberforth Dumbledore]], [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s younger brother, and owner of the [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]]. They discovered that they had been saved by him once before; it was Aberforth who had sent [[Dobby]] to rescue them from the [[Malfoy Manor]] after Harry saw his eye in the remaining shard of Sirius's [[two-way mirror]]. They were later also informed by Neville that Aberforth had been supporting Neville and the other DA members remaining at Hogwarts by feeding them, passing messages using enchanted coins, and generally backing them in their resistance against Severus Snape and the [[Carrow family|Carrows]].\n\nOther Order members Ron encountered were [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], a skilled Auror who would later go on to become [[Minister for Magic]] and who was greatly admired by Ron, Harry, Hermione, and the Weasleys; [[Elphias Doge]], Albus Dumbledore's friend; as well as [[Dedalus Diggle]], [[Hestia Jones]], [[Sturgis Podmore]], and [[Emmeline Vance]]. Emmeline Vance was killed by Death Eaters in 1996, and Podmore was imprisoned because he attempted to get into the Department of Mysteries, under the [[Imperius Curse]], the news of which shocked and horrified Ron.\n\nIt is likely that every surviving member of the Order (except [[Arabella Figg]], who was a Squib and unable to fight, but might have helped in another way) fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] alongside Ron, Harry, and Hermione.\n\n==Etymology==\n''{{w|Ronald}}'' is the Scottish form of the Scandinavian name ''Ragnvald'', which was derived from the Old Norse ''Ragnvaldr'', composed of the elements ''ragn'', \"advice\", and ''valdr'', \"ruler\".<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/ronald Behind the Name: Ronald]</ref> It is a cognate of the name ''{{w|Reginald}}'', which is derived from the Germanic form of the name, ''Raginwald'', meaning \"the prince's counsellor\". All these names carry the meaning of a person who acts as a trusted advisor to a person in power, much as Ron acted as a friend and confidant to [[Harry Potter]].\n\nIn keeping with the pattern of Weasley family members taking names from Arthurian legend, \"Ron\" is the name of Arthur's lance in Geoffrey of Monmouth's ''History of the Kings of Britain''. Ron is short for ''Rhongomyniad'', which means \"striker spear\" in Welsh.\n\n''Bilius'' comes from the word \"{{w|bile}}\", as one of the {{w|Humourism|four humours}} discussed by Ancient Greek philosophers. Yellow bile was connected to the element of fire, which is the element of [[Gryffindor]] house, and someone with an excess of it was believed to be bad-tempered, as Ron is. The English adjective ''\"bilious\"'' also applies to those who have an irritable temper.<ref>{{wtlink|bilious}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Ron_-_Jim_Kay.jpg|thumb|Ron as he appears in {{PS|IE}}, illustrated by [[Jim Kay]]]]\n[[File:OOTP promo front Ron cropped.jpg|thumb|Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley]]\n[[File:Ronald_DH2.png|150px|thumb|Ron Weasley in [[1998]]]]\n[[File:Ron weasley pottermore.PNG|150px|thumb|Ron on {{PM}}]]\n[[File:QuidditchKeeperRonWU.png|150px|thumb|Quidditch Keeper Ron Weasley as he appears in {{WU}}]]\n[[File:RonWeasleyWU.png|150px|thumb|Ron Weasley as he appears in {{WU}}]]\n[[File:Lego2 06 character.jpg|150px|thumb|Ron Weasley in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]\n[[File:Ron-lego y 5-7.jpg|150px|thumb|Ron Weasley in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]\n*[[J.

They are third cousins, however it is unknown if they know of this.\n*Ron is portrayed by [[Great Britain|British]] actor [[Rupert Grint]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]] of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Chamber of Secrets]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Half-Blood Prince]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|Deathly Hallows: Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Part 2]]'' and is one of the 14 characters to appear in all 8 film adaptations; by British actor [[Paul Thornley]] in {{CC|P1}}.<ref name=\"cast1\">[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3368162/Still-magic-middle-age-s-Harry-Potter-new-look-Hermione-Cast-set-star-highly-anticipated-stage-play-revealed.html Still magic in middle age... It's Harry Potter and a new-look Hermione: Cast set to star in highly-anticipated stage play is revealed]</ref>\n**Rupert Grint does not have a long nose, as Ron is described as having in the novels, but he does have freckles - make-up covers them and they aren't on his face, causing some fans to claim he has no freckles at all. He also has green eyes, in contrast to Ron's blue eyes. Ironically, co-star [[Daniel Radcliffe]] has blue eyes in contrast to his character's green eyes. Unlike Ron, Rupert is not particularly tall, nor does he have large hands or feet. Although, like Ron, Rupert is the tallest of the three actors however.\n**Just like Ron Weasley, Rupert Grint comes from a large family, has red hair, and suffers from arachnophobia. Although the Weasley's accent origin is not divulged, Rupert speaks in a combination of modern Received Pronunciation and Cockney accents.\n**Rupert Grint says his favourite scene is the Yule Ball scene in the fourth film, the same as his co-star [[Emma Watson]].\n**[[Jamie Waylett]] plays Ron when he is disguised as [[Vincent Crabbe]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Chamber of Secrets]]'', as do [[Steffan Rhodri]] when he is disguised as [[Reginald Cattermole]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|Deathly Hallows: Part 1]]'' (with no voice change) and Rupert Grint (himself) when he is disguised as \"Dragomir Despard\" in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Deathly Hallows: Part 2]]''. [[Daniel Radcliffe]] also plays Ron in the \"Seven Potters\" scene.\n*Ron was one of the few characters who was created before [[J. K. Rowling]] began writing the series, and whose name never changed from the original drafts.\n*Rowling described Ron's [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] as a \"really sentimental choice\" on her part, since she has a Jack Russell.<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-3.htm 16 July 2005 The Leaky Cauldron Interview with J.K. Rowling]</ref>\n*Rowling has also said that if she had a [[Boggart]], hers would likely be the same as Ron's, as she also dislikes [[spider]]s.<ref name=\"AccioQuote\" />\n*Throughout most of the series, Ron does not like to hear [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s name spoken out loud, and as such, never says it even when Harry and Hermione do. However, he says the name three times in {{DH}}, even after asking Harry and Hermione not to. The first is at [[the Burrow]] when Hermione is packing books to take with them, and Ron says, \"''I forgot we'll be hunting down '''Voldemort''' in a mobile library''\". The second is at [[12 Grimmauld Place]] when [[Remus Lupin]] tells them that [[Pius Thicknesse]] is Minister for Magic, and Ron says, \"''Why didn't '''Voldemort''' declare himself Minister for Magic?''\". The third is again at 12 Grimmauld Place when Harry has a vision of Voldemort killing a woman and her children in his hunt for [[Mykew Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]]. Together, the three try to work out what it means and Ron says, \"''But according to you, '''Voldemort's''' got Ollivander locked up somewhere''\". Ron also said the name in {{QH}}, where he jokingly says, \"'''''Voldemort's''' gettin' really inventive''.\"\n*In the films:\n**Ron is shown as the one to lose his head in a crisis (early on) rather than Hermione.\n**Ron is well known for using the phrase, \"Bloody hell\" when he is surprised or frightened.\n*In {{PS|FA}}, Ron is one of the group of four students to serve detention by helping out Hagrid in the Forbidden Forest. This differs from the book, since Neville was the fourth student (along with Hermione, Harry, and Draco Malfoy). This can be attributed to the significantly less amount of time spent on Hagrid having Norbert, along with the differing circumstances on how they were caught. In the book, Ron wasn't helping deliver Norbert because he was being treated for injuries suffered when he was helping Hagrid take care of Norbert.\n*In {{POA|FA}}, Ron is dragged away by the foot instead of by the arm by Sirius Black in his Animagus form causing the leg to break instead of having Ron break it when hooking it to the [[Whomping Willow]]'s root to avoid being dragged away.\n*In {{GOF|FA}}, Ron supports Bulgaria instead of Ireland, which is who he supports in the book (despite being a Krum fanatic at the time).\n*In {{OOTP|FA}}, Ron was introduced to [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s half-brother [[Grawp]] at the same time as Harry and Hermione. In the book however Ron was playing in the final match of Quidditch championship during that time. This change was due to the removal of Quidditch from the film.\n*In {{HBP}}, Professor [[Horace Slughorn]] refers to Ron by several names, one of which is [[Rupert Grint|Rupert]], which, in fact, is the name of the actor who plays Ron.<ref name=\"HBP\" />\n*In {{DH}}:\n**Ron is revolted by the coffee Hermione ordered for them at the Muggle caf\u00e9, from which we can either assume he didn't like the caf\u00e9's coffee or he doesn't like coffee at all. The latter is more likely since he was raised a wizard and knew little about Muggles except from possibly his father's work with Muggle objects and from being friends with two wizards/witches who were raised by Muggles\n**Ron was shocked that Harry and Hermione had never heard of the children's stories by [[Beedle the Bard]] wizard kids grew up with and when Hermione reminded him that she and Harry were raised by Muggles and that they had grown up with Muggle fairy tales such as \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\" and \"Cinderella\", Ron thought the latter was an illness.\n*In {{DH|F1}} it is George who walks in on Harry and Ginny kissing in the kitchen on Harry's birthday. In the book, it is Ron bursting in on them in Ginny's bedroom.\n*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, Ron has the ability to control Scabbers.\n*The wand that Ron wields in his two full body shot posters for {{DH|F2}} differs. In the first, the wand he is pointing is his [[Ronald Weasley's second wand|second wand]], which was taken from him prior to the film. In the second poster, he is holding the [[Peter Pettigrew's second wand|wand]] he obtained after the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]].\n*Many fans feared the possible death of Ronald Weasley, yet in 2000, Rowling seemed dismissive of these fears, stating \"As if I'm going to kill Harry's best friend.\"<ref name=\"goodscare\">''Time'' Magazine - \"A Good Scare\" - Available on [http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-time-staff.htm Accio Quote]</ref> Yet, when Daniel Radcliffe interviewed Rowling for a special feature on the combo pack Blu-ray edition of {{DH|F2}}, Rowling stated that at a time she had considered killing one of three members of the [[Trio]], specifically Ron. Reflecting upon this, she noted that she wasn't in a good place in her life at the time.\n*He is the only known Pureblood wizard who obtains a Muggle driving licence. It is unclear when Ron obtained his driving licence. However, it has to be after the Second Wizarding War and before the epilogue, which means between May 2nd, 1998 and September 1st, 2017.\n\n===Author's comments===\nIn an interview with J. K. Rowling and Mugglenet, when asked about Ron and the Deluminator she says:\n\n\"''He wasn't the most skilled, or the most intelligent, but he held the trio together; his humour and his good heart were essential.''\"\n\n\u201c''Ron and Hermione, however, are drawn to each other because they balance each other out. Hermione's got the sensitivity and maturity that's been left out of Ron, and Ron loosens up Hermione a bit, gets her to have some fun. They love each other and they bicker a bit, but they enjoy bickering, so we shouldn't worry about it.''\u201d -JK Rowling\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nRon LEGO (old).jpg|Ron Weasley as a LEGO minifigure (old edition)\nRon LEGO (new).jpg|Ron Weasley as a LEGO minifigure (new edition)\nRonaldWeasleyPOP.jpg|Ron Weasley (with his [[Charles Weasley's wand|broken wand]]) as a [[POP!
