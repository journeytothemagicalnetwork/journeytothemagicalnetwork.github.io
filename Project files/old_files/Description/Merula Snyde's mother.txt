She was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] along with [[Merula Snyde's father|her husband]] for their allegiance to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], as they were both [[Death Eaters]].<ref>{{HM|3|8}}</ref> She had at least one daughter, [[Merula Snyde|Merula]], born circa [[1973]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nIn her youth, she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin]], where she would have gained her [[magic]]al education.<ref>After losing a duel against [[Jacob's sibling]], Merula says that she is a fourth-generation [[Slytherin]].</ref> She was part of the [[Frog Choir]].<ref name=\"HMFC\"/> She played on the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]].<ref name=\"Quidditch\">{{HM}}, during a practise match with [[Jacob's sibling]], Merula said that both her parents played for Slytherin's Quidditch team.</ref> At some point, she owned a [[Unicorn]] for a short period of time.<ref>{{HM|3|A Unicorn Surprise!}}</ref>\n\n===First Wizarding War===\nAt the start of the war, she was pregnant with her daughter, [[Merula Snyde|Merula]], who was born around [[1973]]. After that, she and her husband, as [[Death Eaters]], started fighting in the [[First Wizarding War]], as loyal and committed servants of the [[Dark Wizard|Dark Lord]] [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]. She was very powerful and skilful witch and successfully defeated many [[Auror]]s whilst [[duelling]] them. On one particular occasion, she used the [[Incarcerous Spell]] on an Auror, binding them with ropes.<ref>{{HM|5|1}}</ref> On [[Merula Snyde's tenth birthday|Merula's tenth birthday]], she and her husband gave Merula a [[Broomstick|broom]] as a present. They took turns taking Merula on the broom.\n\n===Aftermath===\nShe was sentenced to [[Azkaban]] following the war for her crimes as a Death Eater, along with her husband. This made her very distraught to be separated from her much [[love]]d husband and daughter; the separations appeared to have a very negative effect on the family overall, particularly on young Merula, an event which is widely believed to have resulted in her developing her bitter, cold and spiteful personality towards others.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nMerula's mother was a very cruel, ruthless and powerful [[Wizardkind|witch]]. She was a vicious [[pure-blood supremacist]], and strongly believed in the importance of [[Blood status|blood purity]]. It was the reason why she, along her husband, became [[Death Eaters]]. She was very loyal to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], and was in particular very accomplished in [[duelling]]. Her abilities as a Death Eater allowed her to survive [[First Wizarding War]], and most likely in the Second, if she continued to serve Voldemort following his return. \n\nDespite her malevolent nature, she was very [[Love|loving]] and loyal towards her family. She cared deeply about [[Merula Snyde's father|her husband]] and daughter, [[Merula Snyde|Merula]]. After the war, she was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for several years, which would have had a considerably negative effect on both her mental state and [[magic]]al abilities.\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Merula's mother was skilled in transfiguration, as she was able to bind an [[Auror]] in ropes using the [[Incarcerous Spell]], a form of [[conjuration]], which is a particularly advanced and difficult branch of transfiguration.\n*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': As a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] and loyal and devoted servant of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], Merula's mother would have been proficient with dark magic, and was highly likely to have been capable of performing the [[Unforgivable Curses]], along with various other [[dark charm]]s.\n*'''[[Duelling]]''': Being a Death Eater, Merula's mother was a very competent duellist with considerable proficiency in [[martial magic]]. During her time as a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], she successfully defeated many skilled [[Auror]]s, showing the true extent of her to have been quite formidable in this field.\n*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': Merula's mother was talented in caring for [[magic]]al [[creature]]s, as it was said that she successfully cared for [[unicorn]] in her youth. This would imply a great amount of talent in this area, as taming Unicorns is notoriously difficult given their strict preferences to only bond with certain individuals.\n*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': During her Hogwarts years, Merula's mother played [[Quidditch]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] in an unknown position, showing her to have been an accomplished [[Broomstick]] flyer.<ref name=\"Quidditch\"/>\n*'''Singing skills''': Merula's mother was a talented singer, a trait she passed on to [[Merula Snyde|her daughter]]. She performed in the [[Frog Choir]], where it can be assumed she honed her singing ability.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Family===\nMerula's mother was very caring, [[Love|loving]] and loyal towards her family. She loved [[Merula Snyde's father|her husband]] and daughter [[Merula Snyde|Merula]], and was distraught by the fact that she would be separated from both of them following her imprisonment (along with her husband) in [[Azkaban]]. \n\n===Lord Voldemort===\nMerula's mother was very loyal and devoted to the [[Dark Wizard|Dark Lord]] [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]. She became a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] and fought in the [[First Wizarding War]]. In particular, she passionately shared Voldemort's extremist beliefs in [[pure-blood supremacy]] and also in his radical vision for a strictly [[pure-blood]] society.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{HM}} {{1st Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Death Eaters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Snyde, Mrs}}\n\n[[es:Madre de M\u00e9rula Snyde]]\n[[Category:Azkaban convicts]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Death Eaters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Married individuals]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Pure-blood supremacists]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Snyde family]]\n[[Category:Unnamed family members]]"
