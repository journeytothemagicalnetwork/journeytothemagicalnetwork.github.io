In Irish mythology this was the name of the goddess of fire, poetry and wisdom, the daughter of the god Dagda. In the 5th century it was borne by Saint Brigid, the founder of a monastery at Kildare and a patron saint of Ireland. Because of the saint, the name was considered sacred in Ireland, and it did not come into general use there until the 17th century.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{COS|G}} {{1st}} {{C|PC version}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Duelling Club}}\n[[es:Bridget]]\n[[fr:Brigitte]]\n[[pl:Bridget]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Brown-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:Duelling Club members]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Slytherins]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
