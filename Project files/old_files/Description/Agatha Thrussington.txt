She could usually be found on the [[Exterior Walkway]] during the [[1996\u20131997 school year]].<ref name=\"HBPG\">{{HBP|G}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Agatha\" is the Latinized form of the Greek name \u0391\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7 (Agathe), derived from Greek \u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 (agathos) meaning \"good\". Saint Agatha was a 3rd-century martyr from Sicily who was tortured and killed after spurning the advances of a Roman official. The saint was widely revered in the Middle Ages, and her name has been used throughout Christian Europe (in various spellings). The mystery writer Agatha Christie (1890\u20131976) was a famous modern bearer of this name.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{POA|G}} {{1st}} {{C|Console versions}}\n*{{HBP|G}} {{NDS only}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thrussington, Agatha}}\n[[pl:Agatha Thrussington]]\n[[fr:Agatha Thrussington]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Hufflepuffs]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
