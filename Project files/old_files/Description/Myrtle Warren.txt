Myrtle then ran into one of the bathroom's stalls and started crying. Shortly after Myrtle had entered the bathroom, [[Tom Riddle|Riddle]] entered and started speaking in [[Parseltongue]] in order to open the [[Chamber of Secrets]], the entrance of which was hidden behind the sink in front of the very stall occupied by Myrtle at the time. The [[Serpent of Slytherin]] (a [[basilisk]]) then emerged from the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. The monster had been using the pipes as a means of transportation, as to not be seen and therefore never being caught.<ref name=\"COS16\">{{COS|B|16}}</ref>\n\n[[File:COS carrying Myrtle's body away.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Myrtle's body being removed from school grounds]]\nMyrtle, still in one of the stalls, recognised the voice as being that of a boy. Opening the stall's door, she was about to yell at Riddle to go away. On Riddle's command, the Basilisk stared at Myrtle and her eyes met with the monster's.

Myrtle attended the wedding of Olive's [[Olive Hornby's brother|brother]] uninvited, and apparently caused a massive scene to remind Olive of she bullied her, causing a huge mess. Olive went to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] to restrain Myrtle, who was thereafter obliged to remain at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name=\"GOF25\"/> Ever since, Myrtle haunted the bathroom where she had died, although she was sometimes seen in other bathrooms, and was even flushed into the lake occasionally. As a result of her haunting, her lavatory grave was rarely used, and was thus available for clandestine activities, such as forbidden [[potion]]-brewing, as long as one did not mind the company.<ref name=\"COS10\"/>\n\n====1985-1986 school year====\nMyrtle attended her first [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's four-hundred and ninety-third Deathday Party|deathday party]] held by [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Sir Nicholas]], and also [[Erling the Great|Erling]] later on, on [[31 October]] [[1985]].

In the 1992\u20131993 school year, the Chamber was opened again, fifty years after its previous opening, by a [[Gryffindor]] [[first year]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], who was possessed by the [[T.

(It is possible that Harry was the first person to treat it as something worth asking about.) Myrtle remembered only having seen a pair of enormous yellow eyes, but neither Harry nor Ron recognised this as a clue that the monster was a [[basilisk]]. Hermione had already deduced the monster's nature by [[Hogwarts Library|library]] research before she was [[Petrification|petrified]], so Myrtle's clue was of no practical importance. However her presence in the bathroom combined with Hermione's clue about the basilisk's use of pipes did single the bathroom out as the entrance to the chamber of secrets.<ref name=\"COS16\"/>\n\n====1994-1995 school year====\n{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Moaning Myrtle|Oh ...

Before the second task, the champions had to solve the mystery behind their [[golden egg]]s, which, when opened, emitted a harsh screeching sound. The secret was that the noise became speech when heard underwater. One champion, [[Cedric Diggory]], decided to meditate upon the clue in the [[prefects' bathroom]]. Myrtle spied on Cedric in the tub, admitting to Harry that it took Cedric a long time to figure it out; nearly all the bubbles in the bath were gone by the time he cracked it. Cedric later suggested to [[Harry Potter]] that he take his egg the prefects' bathroom. With Myrtle's hints, Harry was able to decipher the riddle.<ref name=\"GOF25\"/>\n\nMyrtle also appeared to Harry whilst he was in the [[Great Lake|Black Lake]], and pointed him in the right direction to find the [[Merpeople village|village]] of the [[Merpeople]], thereby helping him to reach the Tournament hostages before the other champions.<ref name=\"GOF26\">{{GOF|B|26}}</ref>\n\n====1996-1997 school year====\n{{Quote|...he's sensitive, people bully him, too, and he feels lonely and hasn't got anybody to talk to, and he's not afraid to show his feelings and cry!|Moaning Myrtle regarding Draco Malfoy|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}\nIn [[1997]], Harry and Ron encountered Myrtle in the boy's bathroom as they were talking.

They hoped to interfere with Diggory in the Second Task as well, but in order to do so, needed a means to reach the grounds. They realised that they could do so from the pipes in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Upon seeing them, Myrtle said it had been a while since there had been boys in her bathroom, but noted that she had a soft spot for Potters and was once partial to a Malfoy as well. As such, she helped them by showing them how they could access a pipe to reach the lake.\n\nAfter they did so, Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, Professor [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]] and Ginny Weasley arrived in the bathroom.

The Roman poet Virgil relates the myrtle to Venus and used them in wedding rituals, something that Jewish liturgy, which deemed it sacred, also used. Myrtle has also uses in Wiccan rituals, and was considered medicinal by the ancients, including Hippocrates, Pliny, Galen and Arabian writers.<ref>{{wikilink|Myrtus}}</ref>\n*''Myrtle'' is a variety of the colour {{w|green}}.

This does not seem to happen in male bathrooms, so I enjoyed placing Harry and Ron in such uncomfortable and unfamiliar territory in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' and ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''.|[[J. K. Rowling]] on her inspiration for Moaning Myrtle|Pottermore}}\n*Myrtle was the first person to be killed by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]].\n*Apparently she never informed anyone about her death until she told Harry, Ron and [[Gilderoy Lockhart|Lockhart]]. It's unknown why she never told Armando Dippet or Albus Dumbledore about the cause of her death. It is possible that shortly after her death she was too distraught or traumatised to talk about it and was not asked for fear of upsetting her.\n*Depending on the month she was born in, she may have been in the same year as Gryffindor Rubeus Hagrid, who was accused of killing her with his Acromantula Aragog.\n*Hermione and Myrtle, both Muggle-born, shared similar experiences: both Hermione and Myrtle run to the girls' lavatory upon being teased by classmates, a move that puts both in mortal danger (from a [[Troll in the Bathroom|troll]] and basilisk, respectively.)\n**However, while Hermione is saved by a repentant Ron and Harry, Myrtle is killed by the unfeeling Riddle.\n*Moaning Myrtle was portrayed by [[Shirley Henderson]] in the film adaptations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.\n**Being 5' 0\u00bd\" (1.54 m) and 37 years old when she first played Moaning Myrtle, she is the oldest actress to play a teenage Hogwarts student in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]].<ref name=\"teen\">Technically, graduate students such as [[Albus Dumbledore]] are still Hogwarts students, and played by actors older than Henderson. Myrtle, being dead and not actively studying, is neither an active student. Although she died in [[1943]] and must have been 60 to 68 years old when she first appeared in the [[Harry Potter (book series)|novels]], she stopped ageing when she became a ghost, and thus she can arguably be considered a teenager.</ref>\n**Myrtle is omitted from {{HBP|FA}}.\n*[[Annabel Baldwin]] played Moaning Myrtle in {{CC|P1}}.\n*[[Chika Sakamoto]] voiced Myrtle in the Japanese dubs.\n*According to [[J. K. Rowling]]'s early drafts for {{COS}}, this character was supposed to have been called \"Wailing Wanda\".<ref name=\"pottermoreghosts\">{{WW|hogwarts-ghosts}}</ref>\n*Though never seen or mentioned, Ron and Hermione may have seen Myrtle when they went back down the Chamber of Secrets to destroy Hufflepuff's Cup in ''Deathly Hallows''.\n*Myrtle's surname was never mentioned in the novels; however, in [[2015]], after being asked by a fan over Twitter, J.K. Rowling announced it was Warren and that Myrtle also had a middle name (Elizabeth). Rowling also referred to the middle name of Elizabeth as \"just one of those classic British middle names\". The name was later used in the play ''[[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (play)|Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]''.\n*In one scene of ''Chamber of Secrets'', Ron jokingly suggests that [[Tom Riddle]] earned his Special Award for Services to the School for killing Myrtle; this foreshadows the fact that Riddle did indeed kill her.\n*Myrtle is shown to have a crush on Harry throughout the series.\n**In {{GOF|FA}}, the bathroom scene shows her acting sexually towards Harry.\n*In {{GOF|FA}}, Myrtle mentioned to Harry that she briefly spotted some [[Polyjuice Potion]] in the drains and asked him if he had been doing any more illicit brewing, which he denied. Had Harry investigated Myrtle's suspicions, it might have been discovered much earlier that [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] was impersonating [[Alastor Moody]]. This did not happen in the book.\n*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, Harry and Ron battle Myrtle in the fourth level of the ''Chamber of Secrets'', as she throws numerous objects from the toilets at them in an angry temper, before they can get their hands on Tom Riddle's Diary. In the fourth level of the ''Goblet of Fire'', Myrtle is able to use a [[wand]] in order to perform the basic [[Levitation Charm]] with Harry, so they can use the charm together when needed, despite the series not showing ghosts to be able to cast [[spell]]s or use wands.\n*In {{LEGO|Y2}}, her character is only available wearing her swimsuit.\n*At {{WWHP}}, Moaning Myrtle haunts the restrooms, though only her voice is heard.<ref name=\"wizardingworld\">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJyKvR0dZ0s See this video]</ref> \n*Possible origins of her name and nickname include:\n**It is possible she was named \"Myrtle\" to continue J.K. Rowling's tradition of naming characters after flowers.\n**It is possible she was given the middle name Elizabeth and surname Warren as a reference to two characters from Arthur Miller's ''The Crucible'': Elizabeth Proctor and her young servant Mary Warren, both of which are accused of being witches at some point.\n**The myrtle tree is a close relative of the willow tree. \"Moaning Myrtle\" is a similar phrase to \"weeping willow.\"\n**Possibly related to the \"Moaning Minnie,\" the British name for a German WWII artillery shell that made a distinctive moaning whine before it hit.\n*Myrtle is similar to {{w|Hanako-san}}, a Japanese legend talking about a girl who haunts school bathrooms.\n*Shirley Henderson's first scene in the film ''Bridget Jones's Diary'' involves her character, Jude, crying in a women's toilets.\n*Shirley Henderson and [[Kelly Macdonald]], who played another Hogwarts ghost, [[Helena Ravenclaw|The Grey Lady]], played sisters in the film ''{{w|Intermission (film)|Intermission}}''.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Myrtle Warren}}\n[[File:Moaning Myrtle PAS.png|150px|thumb|Myrtle as she appears in {{PAS}}]]\n*{{COS}} {{1st}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{COS|F}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{COS|G}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{GOF}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{GOF|F}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{OOTP|G}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{HBP}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{CC}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{CC|P}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{PM}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{WW}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{TCG}} {{Mention}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{LEGO}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{WWHP}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{HPV|CH}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{HM}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{WU}} {{Ghost}}\n*{{MA}} {{Ghost}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Warren, Myrtle}}\n\n[[de:Maulende Myrte]]\n[[de2:Myrte Warren]]\n[[es:Myrtle la Llorona]]\n[[fr:Mimi Warren]]\n[[ru:\u041f\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0440\u0442\u043b]]\n[[nl:Jammerende Jenny]]\n[[ja:\u5606\u304d\u306e\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb]]\n[[pl:J\u0119cz\u0105ca Marta]]\n[[pt-br:Murta Que Geme]]\n[[Category:1943 deaths]]\n[[Category:Basilisk victims]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Deaths by creature]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Foundables]]\n[[Category:Ghosts]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts students during the Riddle-era]]\n[[Category:Horcrux victims]]\n[[Category:Killed by Lord Voldemort]]\n[[Category:Muggle-borns]]\n[[Category:Non-graduate Hogwarts students]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 20th century]]\n[[Category:Warren family]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
