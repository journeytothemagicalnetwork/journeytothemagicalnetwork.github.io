We know that Zygmunt Budge tried to enter the Championship sometime in the 16th century, at the age of 14. One can easily determine the years the Championship was held by continuously adding 7 to 1407 \u2014 and Budge's possible birth years are determined by subtracting 14 to each of the 16th century Championship years. He could have also been born in any year 15 years before a 16th century Championship year if he had not yet had his birthday by the time the Championship was held that year.</ref>\n|died = \n|blood = \n|marital = \n|nationality = {{GBorIE}}\n|alias = *\"Fungus-face\" (by his mother)\n*The Hermit of Hermetray (by his neighbour on the [[Isle of Harris]])\n|title = \n|signature = \n|species = [[Human]]<ref name=\"PN\">See [http://pottermore-news.com/2013/06/11/sony-to-release-harry-potter-book-of-potions-for-wonderbook/ this article]</ref>\n|gender = Male\n|height = \n|weight = \n|hair = Dark\n|eyes = \n|skin = Pale\n|family = *[[Zygmunt Budge's mother|Mrs Budge]] (mother)\n*[[Zygmunt Budge's great-grandmother|Great-grandmother]]\n|romances = \n|animagus = \n|boggart = \n|wand = \n|patronus = \n|job = *Author<ref name=\"ps\">See [http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2013/06/e3_2013_sony_brews_wonderbook_book_of_potions_for_playstation_3 this article]</ref>\n*[[Potioneer]]\n|house = \n|loyalty = *[[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] (formerly)\n*[[Wizarding Schools Potions Championship]]\n}}\n{{Quote|I am Zygmunt Budge, and I am the greatest potion-maker ever born.

After this, he would move to the remote island of [[Hermetray]] in the [[Hebrides]], where he lived in solitude, conducted experiments and wrote the ''[[Book of Potions]]'', a [[List of books|textbook]] on the brewing of various [[potion]]s.<ref name=\"PSBLOG\">[http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2013/10/31/wonderbook-book-of-potions-arrives-on-ps3-next-month/ Wonderbook: Book of Potions arrives on PS3 next month - PlayStation.Blog]</ref>\n\nAfter his [[death]], some of his personality lingered in his ''Book of Potions'', and was capable of acting like a guide to future readers of the book.<ref name=\"PSBLOG\" />\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nZygmunt was born somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]], in the [[16th century|16th]] or late [[15th century]]<ref name=\"birthyear\" />.\n\n[[File:Zygmunt Budge and Great-grandmother.png|140px|thumb|left|A young Zygmunt Budge, brewing a potion alongside his [[Zygmunt Budge's great-grandmother|great-grandmother]]]][[Zygmunt Budge's mother|His mother]] did not seem to care for him much, referring to him as 'Fungus-face', on account of his not-so-good looks.\n\nHis [[Zygmunt Budge's great-grandmother|great-grandmother]] was, however, a \"''distressingly giggly''\" witch, in sharp contrast of Zygmunt's temperament, even as a child (in his later years, Budge would find that laughter was ''undignified''). This great-grandmother showed an interest in [[Potion|Potion-making]], and handed him down an old recipe for the [[Laughing Potion]], which he set himself the challenge of refining in his adult years.<ref name=\"BoPlaughingpotion\">{{WBP}} - Chapter 5 (''Laughing Potion'')</ref>\n\n===Hogwarts years===\n{{Quote|As I've said, it was my life's dream to win the Wizarding Schools Potions Championship.

As it was never specified which month the Potions Championship was held in, this gives three possible options:<br/>1) The Potions Championship was held between [[September]] and [[December]] in his third year, and he had already had his birthday earlier that school year, making his sorting happen in a year two years before a Potions Championship, in the year 1503, 1510, ... 1594.<br/>2) The Potions Championship was held in the year when he finished his third year and started his fourth. He had already had his birthday in his third year, but not fourth. This makes his sorting happen three years before a Potions Championship, in the year 1502, 1509, ...1593.<br/>3) The Potions Championship was held between January and June (as the competition did not take place during the [[summer holidays]]) in his fourth year and he had not yet had his birthday that year. This makes his sorting take place four years before a Potions Championship, in 1501, 1508, ... 1592.</ref>.

The incident \u2014 a rival student of his spilled [[Love Potion]] onto himself, thus becoming attracted to their [[16th century Potions Professor|ancient Potions professor]] \u2014 was one that he recollected whenever he needed a loud roar of uncontrollable laughter for his [[Laughing Potion]].<ref name=\"BoPlaughingpotion\" />\n\nBy the time Budge was fourteen, in his third or fourth year, he was top of his class in [[Potions (class)|Potions]], and was even able to correct [[16th century Potions Professor|his Professor]] on the proper use of [[Mackled Malaclaw]] [[Mackled Malaclaw tail|tails]] in potion-making. Having decided he was sufficiently prepared, he asked the Headmaster for permission to enter the [[Wizarding Schools Potions Championship]]. The Headmaster, however, forbade him, because he had not reached the age of seventeen and the competition was too dangerous for him. Furious, Budge decided to drop out of school at once, in protest. Budge considered Hogwarts to have been \"''the school that sought to stifle'' [his] ''brilliance as a potioneer''\", and never regretted his decision.<ref name=\"BoPsleepingpotion\">{{WBP}} - Chapter 4 (''Sleeping Potion'')</ref>\n\n===Living in seclusion===\n{{Quote|Please, understand, some have suggested disappointment warped me.

He lived there the rest of his long life, conducting experiments, perfecting formulae, and creating new concoctions. He also wrote the ''[[Book of Potions]]'', his masterpiece, that he intended to become his legacy for future generations of potioneers.\n\nAfter his death, some of his personality lingered in his ''Book of Potions'', and was capable of acting like a guide to whoever read the book \u2014 in the hopes that, one day, he would be able to aid a budding potioneer to win the [[Wizarding Schools Potions Championship]].\n\n==Magical abilities and skills==\n*'''[[Potion]]s''': Zygmunt Budge was a remarkably brilliant [[Potioneer]], with him being considered as one of the most accomplished of his profession in [[Wizarding world|wizarding]] history. Budge showed his remarkable talent from a young age as a [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] student, with his excellent performance in [[Potions (class)|Potions class]] and his superior knowledge of potions and their ingredients, even compared to his [[Potions Master]]. His exceptional skills in potions allowed him to find and invent new and innovative ways of brewing potions as well as outright create his own brews, which were deemed to be among the most powerful potions in the world, with him even writing his own book, the [[Book of Potions|Book'' of Potions'']], as a showcase of his superb knowledge and skills in this field of [[magic]].\n*'''[[Herbology]]''': Budge was also very familiar with the magical plants used as ingredients for potions, and capable of thoroughly explaining to the one he chose as his champion their functions.\n*'''[[Magizoology]]''': Budge was quite knowledgeable in magical [[creature]]s, as while aiding the one he chose as his champion, he was capable of quickly identifying the weaknesses of the monsters in the way of winning the [[Wizarding Schools Potions Championship]] and figuring out the potion needed to be brewed to overcome them.\n*'''[[Charm]]s''': Budge appeared to be considerably skilled in charm-work, as he was capable of enchanting his [[Book of Potions]] to contain some of his personality inside the book and adding several powerful enchantments inside the book to aid the one he chose to represent him as champion for the [[Wizarding Schools Potions Championship]]. He was also capable of sealing inside the book a [[Portkey]] that can take the reader of his book into the [[Enchanted garden (Book of Potions)|Enchanted Garden]] said event was held in.\n\n==Etymology==\n*'''[[Wikipedia:Zygmunt|Zygmunt]]''' is a Polish name, adapted from the German '''[[Wikipedia:Sigismund|Sigismund]]''', which, along with its variants '''Sigmund''' and '''Siegmund''' means ''\"protection through victory.\"''\n*'''[[Wikipedia:Sigmund|Sigmund/Siegmund]]''' is also the name of a hero from Norse mythology, the father of the [[dragon]]-slayer Sigurd.\n*'''Budge''' is an English verb, meaning \"to move\", often from a state of inactivity.
