During his school career, if his later profession is any indication, he was well known for his sense of humour. Sometime either during his schooling or after he graduated from Hogwarts, he poured [[Bulbadox powder]] in [[Horace Slughorn]]'s [[mead]] as a prank.<ref name=\"HM45\">{{HM|4|5}}</ref> It is also unknown what [[Hogwarts Houses|House]] he was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into whilst at Hogwarts.\n\n===Later life===\nHe once accidentally set off some [[Stink Pellets]] in the closet in his home and, unable to get the smell out, resolved to burn every piece of clothing he owned and buy new ones, only to accidentally burn his home to the ground in the process. This mistake would haunt him for many years to come. By the [[1980s]], Bilton had settled down in [[Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade Village]] and took up a job at the local joke shop. Loud and affable, and with a childlike fondness and enthusiasm for pranks and mischief, Bilton was always happy to accommodate the young scoundrels of [[Hogwarts Castle]] with the latest within classical trouble-making whenever they came to his shop looking for prank devices, and actively encouraged their practical jokes.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Bilton Bilmes}}\n*{{HM}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogsmeade}}\n{{Character-stub}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bilmes, Bilton}} \n[[ru:\u0411\u0438\u043b\u0442\u043e\u043d_\u0411\u0438\u043b\u043c\u0441]] \n[[fr:Jussien Turlupin]]\n[[Category:Blue-eyed individuals]]\n[[Category:British individuals]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Shop owners]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
