He was a [[Beater]] for the [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team]] during the [[1993\u20131994 school year]].<ref name=\"QWC\">{{QWC}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Jason\" comes from the Greek name \u0399\u03b1\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd (Iason), which was derived from Greek \u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 (iasthai) \"to heal\". In Greek mythology Jason was the leader of the Argonauts. After his uncle Pelias overthrew his father as king of Iolcos, Jason went in search of the Golden Fleece in order to win back the throne. During his journeys he married the sorceress Medea, who helped him gain the fleece and kill his uncle, but who later turned against him when he fell in love with another woman.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{QWC}} {{1st}} \n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Samuels, Jason}}\n[[de:Jason Samuels]]\n[[es:Jason Samuels]]\n[[fr:Jason Samuels]]\n[[pl:Jason Samuels]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:Beaters]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ravenclaws]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
