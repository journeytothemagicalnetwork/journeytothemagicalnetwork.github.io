Alexis once signed up for [[Quidditch]] training at 7pm on Saturday on a sign-up sheet that was posted on the [[Gryffindor Notice Board|bulletin board]] in the [[Gryffindor Common Room]].<ref name=\"WWHP\">{{See image|File:QuidditchTrainingSignupSheet.jpg}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Alexis\" comes from the Greek name \u0391\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 (Alexis), which meant \"helper\" or \"defender\", derived from Greek \u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03c9 (alexo) \"to defend, to help\". This was the name of a 3rd-century BC Greek comic poet, and also of several saints. It is used somewhat interchangeably with the related name \u0391\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 or Alexius, borne by five Byzantine emperors. In the English-speaking world it is more commonly used as a feminine name.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WWHP}} {{Mentioned on a poster}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Hogwarts quidditch positions}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marie, Alexis}}\n[[es:Alexis Marie]]\n[[pl:Alexis Marie]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Marie family]]\n[[Category:Quidditch players]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
