Once, he had an [[Illegal growth hex|illegal hex]] (perhaps ''[[Engorgio Skullus]]'') used on him by [[James Potter I|James Potter]] and [[Sirius Black]] which caused his head to grow twice its original size. It is unknown what motivated the duo to hex him, though it rewarded them a double detention.<ref name=\"HBP24\">{{HBP|B|24}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Bertram means \"bright raven\", from Germanic roots. The name meaning has quite a connection with the Ravenclaw house (bright as in witty, and raven as in Ravenclaw), which could lead to speculation that Bertram Aubrey was a Ravenclaw.\n\nThe name Aubrey has multiple meanings. It can mean \"noble and bright\", \"blond ruler\" and \"rules with elf wisdom\". This could also connect him to Ravenclaw, being \"bright\".\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{HBP}} {{1st Mention}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aubrey, Bertram}}\n\n[[de:Bertram Aubrey]]\n[[es:Bertram Aubrey]]\n[[fr:Bertram Aubrey]]\u00a0\n[[pl:Bertram Aubrey]]\n[[ru:\u0411\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043c \u041e\u0431\u0440\u0438]]\n[[Category:20th century births]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Hogwarts students during the Marauders' era]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sorted in the 20th century]]\n[[Category:Unknown House]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
