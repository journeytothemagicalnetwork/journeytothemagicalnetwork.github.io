He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in his youth, and was a member of [[Gryffindor]] house.<ref name=\"House\">{{LEGO|Y1}} ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-AxllULlEE/ see video])</ref> Eventually, he began driving the [[Knight Bus]]. He worked with [[Stanley Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]], the conductor of the Knight Bus, who sometimes called Ernie by his nickname, Ern.<ref name=\"PA3\"/> \n\n===[[1990s]]===\n{{Quote|Best go wake up [[Madam]] [[Marsh]], Stan, we'll be in [[Abergavenny]] in a minute|Ernie whilst driving the Knight Bus|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}\n[[Harry Potter]] first encountered Prang in [[1993]], when he was picked up by the [[Knight Bus]] after leaving his [[Petunia Dursley|Aunt]] and [[Vernon Dursley|Uncle]]'s [[4 Privet Drive|house]]. When Harry was taken to the [[Leaky Cauldron]] Ernie followed him in and was forced to leave by [[Cornelius Fudge]], the then-Minister of Magic.<ref name=\"PA3\">{{POA|B|3}}</ref>\n\nErnie was also present at [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|funeral]] in [[1997]].<ref name=\"HP30\">{{HBP|B|30}}</ref>\n\n==Physical appearance==\nPrang was described as an elderly grey-haired wizard with very thick glasses, giving him an \"[[owl]]ish\" appearance.<ref name=\"PA3\"/>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nPrang was very clearly committed to his driving, and seldom talked much to passengers on the Knight Bus. (leaving that to Stan Shunpike, preferring to concentrate on his driving).<ref name=\"PA3\"/> He also was clearly a supporter of [[Albus Dumbledore]], following his decision to attend his funeral, implying he also supported the [[Order of the Phoenix]] and its goals as well.<ref name=\"HP30\"/>\n\nPrang's driving skills left much to be desired and were in dire need of improvement, as he frequently drove off the road and into objects, such as post boxes, lamp posts and trees. This may have been at least partly due to the bus' extreme speed. Fortunately, due to the bus' magical nature, the objects got out of the way.<ref name=\"PA3\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nErnie Prang and [[Stanley Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]], the driver and conductor of the [[Knight Bus]], were named after [[J. K. Rowling]]'s grandfathers, Ernest Arthur Rowling and Stanley George Volant, respectively.<ref name=\"Pottermore\" /> Ernie's last name is a play on words, as \"prang\" is English slang meaning \"to wreck an automobile\".\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*In {{POA|FA}}, Ernie is played by the late [[Jimmy Gardner]].\n*In the 2004 {{LEGO}} set 4755 [[Knight Bus]], Prang was replaced by [[Stanley Shunpike]] as the driver of the [[Knight Bus]]. Despite this, Prang was included later in the 2011 remake set 4866 [[Knight Bus]].\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Imagecat|Images of Ernie Prang}}\n[[File:LEGOernie.png|thumb|150px|Ernie as a LEGO minifigure (2019 edition)]]\n[[File:Legoernieprang.png|thumb|150px|Ernie Prang in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]\n*{{POA}} {{1st}}\n*{{POA|F}}\n*{{OOTP}} {{Mention}}\n*{{HBP}}\n*{{PM}} {{Mention}}\n*{{LEGO|B}}\n*{{LEGO|C}}\n*{{LEGO|Y1}}\n*{{LEGO|Y2}} {{C|Consoles and Windows versions}}\n*{{LEGO}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Prang, Ernest}}\n[[de:Ernie Prang]]\n[[es:Ernie Prang]]\n[[fr:Ernie Danlmur]]\n[[pl:Ernie Prang]] \n[[it:Ernie Botto]]\n[[Category:British or Irish individuals]]\n[[Category:Gryffindors]]\n[[Category:Knight Bus crew]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]"
