"Carl Hopkins was a wizard and Gryffindor student who most likely began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s.During the 19961997 school year at Hogwarts, he took N.E.W.T.-level Potions, as he someday hoped to be an Auror. He confessed to Harry Potter in 1997 that he would have liked a new broom. He also admitted that he was a \"disaster\" in Potions. At the end of the school year, he could be found in the Entrance Courtyard, near Scott Ancrum.Potions: Carl must have achieved a high grade at Ordinary Wizarding Level in order to qualify for N.E.W.T. level Potions, although he commented that he largely struggled with the subject at such an advanced level, labelling himself a \"disaster\".The name \"Carl\" is the German form of Charles.If he survived the Battle of Hogwarts, it is likely that he would have gone on to join the British Ministry of Magic alongside his peers, Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, Neville Longbottom and - possibly - also Fay Dunbar, seen Kingsley Shacklebolt offered a place at the Auror Office for students that survived the final battle of the Second Wizarding War.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (First appearance) (Console versions)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS version only)"
