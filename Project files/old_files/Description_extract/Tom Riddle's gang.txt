"Tom Riddle's gang were a group of fellow Slytherin students whom Tom Riddle had around him during his time at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.Tom Riddle assembled this gang at Hogwarts. He claimed they were his friends, and made it appear so in public. In truth, however, he had no emotional attachment to them, as he never once desired a friend, and he only manipulated them to do his deeds, which led to nasty incidents over the years, among them being them assisting Riddle to open the Chamber of Secrets. Through Riddle's intelligent and discreet methods, the gang was never connected to these incidents.Presumably, although the gang disbanded after Riddle graduated from Hogwarts in 1945, it was a precursor to the Death Eater organisation. According to Riddle, he was even already going by the name \"Lord Voldemort\" among the members of the gang. Indeed, at least some of the members became the earliest known Death Eaters.Tom Riddle (leader)AveryLestrangeRosier (possibly)Mulciber (possibly)Nott (possibly)The Death Eaters may at some point have been titled the Knights of Walpurgis. This name seems to be a play on Walpurgis Night, the evening of 30 April when, according to legend, witches and demons gather.Interestingly, this group shares many of the same surnames with those who were part of the gang of Slytherins that attended Hogwarts in the 1970s. This is likely not coincidental as those in the latter group may be the children of those in the former.It's unknown what happened to the members of the gang when Tom was abroad looking for followers. It's possible that they travelled with him or they may have simply kept in correspondence with him while remaining in England.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (First mentioned)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (First appearance) (Appears in flashback(s))Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film) (Appears in flashback(s))Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (Appears in flashback(s))"
