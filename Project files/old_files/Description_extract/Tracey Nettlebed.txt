"Tracey Nettlebed was a Slytherin student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.Several students stated that she was willing to \"dish the dirt on anyone\" if what she gained in return was to her satisfaction. In keeping with this assessment, in 1996 she agreed to tell Harry Potter what she knew about Draco Malfoy's activities in the Seventh-floor corridor in exchange for a Skiving Snackbox, which she planned to use to skip Transfiguration (a subject she described as \"stupid\"). She warned Harry not to tell anyone about what she told him.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (PS2 version only)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS version only)"
