"Kim Sheringham was a witch and Ravenclaw student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s. In 1996, she took a silver dress belonging to Luna Lovegood, which she described as \"horrid\" and thought needed to be hidden \"somewhere dark.\" Luna wanted to wear this dress to Professor Slughorn's Christmas party. However, although she said she thought it ought to be kept out of sight, Kim wore the dress herself in public, allowing Harry Potter to find her in the Clock Tower Courtyard. Harry had to give her a bottle of Butterbeer in order to get her to give the dress back.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (First appearance) (Console version)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS version only)"
