"Kouta Ohnishi was a wizard and Hufflepuff student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s.During the 19961997 school year, he had to brew a Draught of Peace for Potions, but could not do so because he lacked the horned slugs that were one of the ingredients required to make the potion. He traded syrup of Hellebore with Harry Potter in order to get the horned slugs he needed. He was also a member of the Duelling Club.The name \"Kouta\" is from Japanese  (kou) \"peace\" and  (ta) \"thick, big\".It is most likely that Kouta was in his fifth year in the 19961997 school year, as the Draught of Peace is usually brewed in that year.Given his name, he is most likely of Japanese descent.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (PS2 version only) (First appearance)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS version only)"
