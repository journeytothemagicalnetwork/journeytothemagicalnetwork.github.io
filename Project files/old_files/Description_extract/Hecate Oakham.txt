"Hecate Oakham was a witch, born in or prior to 1982, somewhere in either Ireland or Great Britain. When she turned eleven she began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. During the 1993-1994 school year, Harry Potter saw her roaming the castle alone rather often.Hecate gets her name from Hecate, in Latin, or Hekate, in Greek. They both refer to the same goddess. In Greek mythology, she is an embodiment of the dark side of the moon and is the deity of magic. She is a foggy figure of unclear allegiances, sphere and parentage. She is chthonic and often is associated with sorcery, being the mother of angels and poisonous plants.The Goddess Hecate in turn has verious etymology behind her name. Her name may originally come from the Greek word for will. Various Greeks have also translated her name to mean \"operates from afar\", \"she removes or drives off\", \"the far reaching one\" or \"the far-darter\". Another suggested root of the name is from the Egyptian goddess of childbirth, however, evidence for this is lacking.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (PS2 version only)"
