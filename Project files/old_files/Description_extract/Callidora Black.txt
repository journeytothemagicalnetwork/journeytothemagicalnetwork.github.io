"Callidora Longbottom (n\\xe9e Black) (b. 1915) was a pure-blood witch, the eldest daughter of Arcturus Black II and Lysandra Yaxley and sister of Charis and Cedrella. She married Harfang Longbottom, and the couple had two children, a son and a daughter. She is related to the Crouch and Weasley families through her sisters, and may be related to Mr Longbottom and his son and grandson.Callidora means \"gift of beauty\" in Greek. It is also the name of a species of sedge moths.Callidora's sister Cedrella was disowned by their family for marrying Septimus Weasley, a \"blood traitor\". Given that Callidora was not burned off the Black family tree tapestry for her marriage, this suggests that the Longbottoms are considered to be a more \"respectable\" pure-blood family than Weasleys. Interestingly, the Longbottom family would be seen as \"blood traitors\" now because they opposed Voldemort's reign and the notion of blood purity.Since Callidora and Cassiopeia were born in the same year, it is most likely that they were classmates at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.Callidora's and Elladora's pictures on the family tree in the film are the same.Callidora was not featured on the Longbottom family tree shown on Pottermore.As Callidora and her sisters Cedrella and Charis were born between 1915 and 1919, they would have been three of the many first ever Slytherins Horace Slughorn taught when he became Potions teacher in 1931.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film) (Appears on Black family tapestry)Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game) (Seen on Black family tree tapestry)Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (video game) (Seen on Black family tree tapestry)"
