"Euan Abercrombie was a wizard and Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s.He began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in September 1995, when Harry was in his fifth year. As he was first in his year alphabetically, he was the first to be sorted, and was sorted into Gryffindor House. He was a small boy with prominent ears, who often looked terrified. He appeared to believe in the Daily Prophet's smear campaign against Harry Potter, as he looked at him fearfully when Harry tried to smile at him.\"Abercrombie\" is a surname of Celtic or Gaelic origin. It comes from the name of a parish in Fife, Scotland, on the northern shore of the Firth of Forth, whence the possessor took his surname; from Aber, marshy ground, a place where two or more streams meet; and cruime or crombie, a bend or crook. Aber, in the Celtic and Gaelic, and also in the Cornish British, signifies the confluence of two or more streams, or the mouth of a river, where it flows into the sea; hence it is often applied to marshy ground, generally near the confluence of two rivers. It also signifies, sometimes, a gulf or whirlpool. \"Euan\" is of Scottish and Gaelic origin, and it means \"born of yew\" or \"youth\". It also means \"little swift one\" in Irish Gaelic.Chinese (Simplified): \\xb7Chinese (Traditional): \\xb7Croatian: Euan AbercombieDutch: Eelco AbeelGreek:  Hebrew:  Japanese: Lithuanian: Juanas AberkrombisNorwegian: Johan AbelinRussian:   (Yuan Aberkrombi)Serbian:   (Juan Aberkrombi)Ukrainian:   (Yuan Aberkrombi)The following languages are the same as the original:Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (First appearance)"
