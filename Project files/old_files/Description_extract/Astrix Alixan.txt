"Astrix Alixan (b. 1670s) was a Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1680s and 1690s. He was once Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team from 1688 to 1692.In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, set during the 19921993 school year, it is mentioned that the Gryffindor team had been one player short during the final match of the previous school year, against Ravenclaw (Harry Potter had been unconscious in the Hospital Wing), and had for that reason suffered their worst defeat in three-hundred years. That would mean that their previous worst defeat ever had taken place in around the 1691-1692 school year, most likely during Astrix Alixan's captaincy.Harry Potter films (Name appears on plaque)Harry Potter: The Exhibition (Name appears on plaque)"
