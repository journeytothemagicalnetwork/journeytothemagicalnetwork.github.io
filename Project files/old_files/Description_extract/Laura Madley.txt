"Laura Madley (born c. 1983) was a witch that started attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1994, and was sorted into Hufflepuff. Laura would share a dormitory with Eleanor Branstone who was also sorted into Hufflepuff that year.Laura is the feminine form of the Late Latin name Laurus, which meant \"laurel\".
