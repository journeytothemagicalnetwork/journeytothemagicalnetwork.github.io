"Edward was a Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School during the 1990s. In 1992 he became a member of the Duelling Club and was ranked ten on the Club's top-ten duellists list.The name \"Edward\" means \"rich guard\", derived from the Old English elements ead \"rich, blessed\" and weard \"guard\". Saint Edward the Confessor was the king of England shortly before the Norman conquest. He was known as a just ruler, and because of his popularity this name remained in use after the conquest when most other Old English names were replaced by Norman ones. The 13th-century king Henry III named his son and successor after the saint, and seven subsequent kings of England were also named Edward. This is one of the few Old English names to be used throughout Europe (in various spellings).Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) (First appearance)"
