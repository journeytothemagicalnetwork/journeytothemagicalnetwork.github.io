"Haley Dakota was a Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She once signed up for Quidditch training at 7pm on Tuesday on a sign-up sheet that was posted on the bulletin board in the Gryffindor Common Room.The name \"Hayley\" is from a surname which was originally derived from the name of an English town (meaning \"hay clearing\" from Old English heg \"hay\" and leah \"clearing\"). It was popularised by the British child actress Hayley Mills (1946-), though the name did not become common until over a decade after she first became famous.The Dakota are the Santee branch of the Sioux people who traditionally lived in parts of Canada and the United States. There are many places and people named for the Dakota. Dakota, which refers both to the people and their language, is made up of two words - da meaning \"considered\" or \"to think of as ...\" and koda meaning \"friend\", \"companion\", \"friendly\" or \"friendship.\" The name Dakota translates literally as \"considered friend\" and came to mean \"friendly\", \"allies\", \"allied\",\"ally\" or \"the allied ones.\" Earlier spellings of Dakota include Dakhota and Dakotah.Dakota, the earliest of the three, is linguistically related to the other two dialetical branches Lakota and Nakota (i.e. Assiniboine). Instead of koda, the Lakota use the word kola and the Nakota use the word kona to denote a friend or ally. The Lakota also use the word ko to mean \"included\" which may indicate that kola, along with kona and koda may, themselves, be compound words. Lakota is listed as meaning \"alliance of friends\".The Wizarding World of Harry Potter (Mentioned on a poster)"
