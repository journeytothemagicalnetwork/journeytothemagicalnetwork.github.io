"Davies was a wizard and student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s. On one occasion during the 19961997 school year, Professor McGonagall caught him about to enter the girls' lavatory, and scolded him for it.It is possible this individual may be a relative of Chester and Roger Davies.It is uncertain whether the script writers intended this individual to be Roger Davies, though if they did this would likely not be a canonical mention, as mentions of Roger in the books (and lack thereof in the sixth book) imply that he graduated the previous year.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film) (First mentioned)"
