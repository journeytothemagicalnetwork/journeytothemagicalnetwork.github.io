"Natalie Fairbourne was a Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s. She claimed to be the best Exploding Snap player at Hogwarts, and, during the 19961997 school year, managed to win a Viktor Krum figurine through playing the game. She agreed to give this figurine to Harry Potter if he could beat her at a game of Exploding Snap.The name \"Natalie\" is from the Late Latin name Natalia, which meant \"Christmas Day\" from Latin natale domini. This was the name of the wife of the 4th-century martyr Saint Adrian of Nicomedia. She is venerated as a saint in the Orthodox Church, and the name has traditionally been more common among Eastern Christians than those in the West. It was popularised in America by actress Natalie Wood (1938-1981), who was born to Russian immigrants, and is now considered a fairly common name.This particular student was only featured in the PlayStation 2 version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Nintendo DS version of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (PS2 version only)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (NDS version only)"
