							<b>This webpage is the final project for the course Social graphs and interactions (02805) offered by the Technical University of Denmark.</b>
							<br>
							<br>
							Welcome to this magical journey through the mysteries and insights of the Harry Potter universe!
							<br>
							<br>
							Choosing the main topic for our final project was not easy, as the internet is full of fandoms and there are millions of pages we could have turned to. But all three members of this wonderful team felt the same when we thought of Harry Potter. We reminisce about those fantasy films we grew up with and dreamt about so many times. All of us agreed that Harry Potter had influenced our childhood and adolescence in a way that was as special as a few other book and film sagas.
							<br>
							<br>
							This project makes it clear that motivation towards a task completely changes the perspective with which the task is approached. In our case, and from the first day we decided to tackle this topic, we felt the magic of the Harry Potter world welling up inside us and turning us into frenzied fans of the magical world at the mercy of networks and graphs. The opportunity we had before us to venture into the secrets of the connection between characters, between the houses of Hogwarts, or even the development of the feelings of the most important characters throughout the saga... Simply thrilling!
							<br>
							<br>
							Our most arduous task is to lead the audience, namely you, along this path in which enormous amounts of information are revealed and to keep the mystery and excitement of further reading. We have tried to make this adventurous journey through data analysis that combines the world of knowledge with the magic of JKRowling's pen as bearable as possible. So, without further ado, welcome to Harry Potter and the Graph of Secrets.
							<br>
							<br>
							The following video, besides being an amazing visual experience, summarizes the central idea of the project and gives a great introduction to the project. Enjoy!

							<h2><b>Project 1 -</b> WordCloud analysis of houses</h2>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 40px; ">
								We have computed the wordcloud of each of the house with and without tc-idf transformation to show that the tc-idf WordClouds are more descriptive. We also have highlighted the main attributes of each house, for instance for the house of Slytherin, the fact that the words like "kill" and "killing" again show the evil nature of the Slytherins.
							<h2><b>Project 2 -</b> Communities</h2>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 40px; ">
								We have used the Louvain communities algorithm to cluster the characters from the wikipage. We can see how the Louvain algorithm has managed to group the characters together, often managing to separate characters of the movies from the characters from the games. The algorithm also managed to put old Gryffindor quiddich captain into one group, and other past quiddich playes in another group. The size of the communities varied a lot however, with community 1 having almost 200 members while several other communities didn't even have 10. This meant that some of the communities would be hard to analyze using WordCloud and sentiment analysis since there wouldn't be enough data for proper analysis.
							<h2><b>Project 3 -</b> Sentiment Analysis</h2>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 40px; ">
								We have used the scripts from the movies to analyze the evolution the characters' sentiment. First, as there sentiments are calculated per chapter, there are several characters whose sentiment graphs aren't complete as they don't appear in every chapter. When we look at the main character, Harry Potter, we can see that the VAder sentiment and LabMT sentiment generally tend to follow each other. Sometimes one will have a more extreme peak or dip than the other, for example, the LabMT sentiment has a much more dramatic drop than the vader sentiment at the end of movie 1.
								<br>
								When we looked at the overall sentiment, we noticed that the average sentiment of each movie seems to be about the same. We also provide a analysis of the sentiment per house and the explanation of the drop and spike per chapter.
							<h2><b>Project 4 -</b> Similarity between characters</h2>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 40px; ">
								We decided to go out of our comfort zone by applying a new type of algorithm: Node to Vector to find similarity between characters. We created a weighted graph to have a better reflection of the relation between the characters. Then, the algorithm will create one vector per node and based on this vector, we can do some mathematical operation. The outcomes of this project have been:
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 80px; ">
								 - To identify who is Harry Potter's closest characters according to the graph
								<br>
								 - Who is Harry Potter's lover, according to the graph?
								<br>
								 - Understand the Louvain communities with the Node to Vector algorithm?
							<h2><b>Project 5 -</b> Emotion</h2>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 40px; ">
								In order to go beyond the positive and negative sentiment and get complex emotion such as happiness, hate or worry, we trained a model to recognize those sentiments on a training set (made by categorized tweet) and apply it to the Harry Potter's movie scripts. This technique is called transfer learning. The outcome was to show the impact of each emotion or feeling in each scene of the entire Harry Potter saga. We have analysis the evolution of each emotion and gave explanation for each drop/spike.

							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
								First of all, we started with a study of the Harry Potter wiki page, looked at how we could extract information and brainstormed possible ideas for the scope of our final project. We decided to begin by extracting information on as many characters as possible and, to commence with, categorizing them by their Hogwarts houses:
							</p>
							<br>
								<table  class="center" style="text-align:center">
									<tr>
										<th><img alt='Gryffindor' src='assets/images/Gryffindor.png' width='200'></th>
										<th><img alt='Ravenclaw' src='assets/images/Ravenclaw.png' width='200'></th>
										<th><img alt='Hufflepuff' src='assets/images/Hufflepuff.png' width='200'></th>
										<th><img alt='Slytherin' src='assets/images/Slytherin.png' width='200'></th>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td><h2>Gryffindor</h2></td>
										<td><h2>Ravenclaw</h2></td>
										<td><h2>Hufflepuff</h2></td>
										<td><h2>Slytherin</h2></td>
									</tr>
								</table>
							<br>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
								Eventually, we added a fifth cathegory called "Unknown_House" as some of the characters are not members of a house. 
								<br>
								<br>
								In order to create the wonderful graph plotted below, where each character is shown as a node colored by its house and connected to the characters its wiki fandom page links to, we had to undertake a deep process of data cleaning from the data obtained from the querys. 
								<br>
								<img src="assets/images/graph_houses.png" alt="Graph Houses" width="10000" height="1000" >
								<br>
								One of the most challenging parts of this first steps was the cleaning of the raw data obtained from the wiki of Harry Potter. In order to achieve that and get the "clean" version of each character description, we had to carefully analyse, detect and eliminate each of the patterns effectively. When dealing with this task we encountered a huge amount of different patterns we had to look for and carefully remove to leave the relevant information intact for us. These are some examples:
								<br>
								<img src="assets/images/patterns.PNG" alt="patterns" width=450>
								<br>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									...and much more. As it can be seen, there was much to take into consideration when dealing with the cleaning of the text, not only with different forms of holding the text but also unicode and special characters. The final version of the main patterns used can be seen below:
									<br>
									<img src="assets/images/final_patterns.PNG" alt="patterns" width=450>
									<br>
									<br>
									Finally, we got the network! The main characteristics of this network are given by a number of <b>511 nodes and 5446 links</b>. It is worth mentioning that throughout the project we have noticed that the size of the network has changed slightly, presumably due to changes in the Harry Potter wiki page. 
									<br>
									<br>
									The TOP connected characters in the network (all degree) are the following:
									<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 40px; ">
										- Harry Potter (371)
										<br>
										- Albus Dumbledore (222)
										<br>
										- Tom Riddle (218)
										<br>
										- Ronald Weasley (211)
										<br>
										- Hermione Granger (201)
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									Wonderful! The names shown were expected as they are some of the most famous characters. Tom Riddle is of course "he who must not be named", also known as Lord Voldemort. For more insights please refer to the explainer notebook.

	                            	After concluding that our network  follows a scale-free regime, we wanted to check "the 80/20 rule". Following the NetworkScienceBook by A.L.Barabási, <i>"The 80/20 rule is present in networks as well: 80% of links on the Web point to only 15% of webpages; 80% of citations go to only 38 percent of scientists; 80% of links in Hollywood are connected to 30% of actors. Most quantities following a power law distribution obey the 80/20 rule." </i><a href="http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/4#power-laws" target="_blank" style="color:DodgerBlue"><u>Ref.</u></a> Let's find out how this 80/20 rule behaves in our Network!
	                            	<br>
	                            	<img src="assets/images/8020rule.png" alt="80/20 Rule" width="700" class="center-im">
	                            	<br>
	                            	After doing the analysis and plotting the results we conclude that our network follows the 80/20 rule, as we can see that in our case the 80% of the network is represented by the 26.6% of the characters. In fact, the character that makes the 80% of the links of the Harry Potter wikipage is called "Cadogan", representing the 26.6% of all the characters in the network.
	                            <br>
	                            <br>
	                            Finally, we plot the network in a more beautiful display thanks to the use of the "forceatlas2" package. In the network the most relevant names of each house have been printed. As expected, they match with our expectations based on our knowledge about the saga. Great!

								This part is about analyzing the different houses of Hogwarts with the use of wordclouds, i.e. we will generate images consisting of words, with the size of the words in the image proportional to the number of times that word appears in the string used to generate the image. Firstly, we want to analyze how the members of the different houses speak and see if there are any patterns/trends there. Secondly, we want to use the characters' wiki-descriptions to look for any trends/differences between the houses.
								<h2><b>Part A -</b> WordClouds based on character dialogue                     
                            	</h2>
								<br>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
	                            	For the analysis of the way members of the different houses speak, we used the movie scripts data. The results are shown in the wordclouds below: 
	                            <br>
	                            <br>
								<img src="assets/images/script_WordClouds.png" alt="Script WordClouds" class="center-im">
								<br>
								<br>
								<h2 style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;"><u>Gryffindor</u></h2>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									We can see that the names Harry, Ron and Hermione appear a lot in the Gryffindor script. This makes sense as these are the three main characters we follow through the movies and they are all from the Gryffindor house, hence when they talk to each other they will likely say each other's names. The fact that the word Voldemort also appears often shows that Voldemort is an imprtant charcter in the movies, but also that the main characters aren't scared of saying "He-who-must-not-be-named"'s name, character traits of true heros.
								<h2 style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ravenclaw</u></h2>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									One name which appears often here is Luna, which is from Luna Lovegood who is an important character of the Ravenclaw house. Words such as "wand" and "disarm" show that often when we come across Ravenclaw characters in the movies it involves them performing magic. Finally, two words of great importance are "deathly" and "hallows" which display the part members of the Ravenclaw house played during the wars in the final two movies (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 and 2). Luna Lovegood's father, Xenophilius Lovegood, wears a symbol of the Deathly Hallows, which could be another reason why those words appear so much.
								<h2 style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;"><u>Slytherin</u></h2>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									One thing that stands out here after havig watched the movies are the words "Potter", "Weasley", and "mudblood", which isnantly makes one thing of Draco Malfoy when he mucks the trio. He often refers to Hermione as "mudblood", and refers to Harry and Ron as "Potter" and "Weasley" in very degrading ways. Words such as "lord" and "prophesy" show that the Slytherins look up to "Lord Voldemort", and words like "kill" show their even nature.
								<h2 style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;"><u>Hufflepuff</u></h2>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									Basically, all words in the script tc-idf WordCloud of the Hufflepuff house are associated with the Mandrake plants. Words like "mandrake", "seeding", "earmuffs", "pull" and "pot" show this.
								<br>
								<br>
								<h2><b>Part B -</b> WordClouds based on character wiki-pages                       
	                            </h2>
	                            <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
	                            	For the analysis of the characters' wiki-pages, we used the DataFrame created from the Harry Potter wiki pages. The results obtained are shown in the wordclouds below: 
	                            <br>
	                            <br>
								<img src="assets/images/wiki_WordClouds.png" alt="Wiki WordClouds" class="center-im">
								<br>
								<br>
								<h2 style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;"><u>All Houses</u></h2>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									Some words that occur in the WordClouds of each house are words such as "professor", "death", "wand" and "magic". These words describe the overall jist of the movies: It's about magic at a school, and there's a lot of death and grief.
								<h2 style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;"><u>Gryffindor</u></h2>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									"Friend", "muggle" and "battle" are some of the words that stand out in the Gryffindor WordCloud. The fact that words liek "friend" and "muggle" appear often could be a sign that the Gryffindor house is more open for muggle-born wizards and witches, and also has a more friendly vibe than other houses. The word "battle" might show that the are a lot of members of the Gryffindor house who are involved in the battle against Voldemort.
								<h2 style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;"><u>Ravenclaw</u></h2>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									For the Ravenclaws, words such as "book" and "class" show that they have a strong focus on academia.
								<h2 style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;"><u>Slytherin</u></h2>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									Here, the word "voldemort" stands out even more than in the other houses' WordClouds, this makes sense since many Slytherins are fighting for him, and he himself is a part of the Slytherin house. Words like "kill" and "killing" again show the evil nature of the Slytherins.
								<h2 style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;"><u>Hufflepuff</u></h2>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									Again, here for the WordClouds based on the wiki descriptions, a major part of the Hufflepuff WordCloud is based around the plants. "plant", "greenhouse", "mandrake", and "herbology" show this.

								In this section we will group all the characters into communities using the <b>Louvain algorithm</b>. We will do this in order to see if any interesting partitions occur, e.g. <i>Will all the professors end up in a group together? Will the "good" characters be grouped together and the "evil" characters together?</i>
								<br>
								<br>
								The <b>Louvain algorithm</b> belongs to the class of modularity maximization algorithms for community detection, it tries to optimize the overall modularity of the found partitionning. In terms of its functioning, it works by repeating two steps until the communities found in the last iteration don't have a better modularity than those in the previous iteration. These 2 steps are:
								<br>
								<br>
								<b> - Step One:</b> Each node in the network is assigned its own community, and the modularity of the graph is calculated. Then, each node is grouped with each of its neighbours to form a new tentative community, and the net change in total modularity is calculated from the resulting graph. Once this has been done for all of a node's neighbours, the tentative community that provided the greatest increase in modularity is chosen and becomes an actual community (that is, the two nodes that were grouped are assigned the same community). The algorithm then procedes to the next node and does the same until all nodes have been processed.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b> - Step Two:</b> The second step consists in building a new network in which each newly determined community is represented by a single node. The weights of the links between the nodes (former communities) in the new network are given by summing up the weights of the links between nodes in the two former communities. After the creation of the network, step one is done again.
								The algorithm ends when there is no more positive gain achieved to the modularity of the network when re-doing step one.
								<br>
								<br>
								We are using the Louvain algorithm in order to identify our communities. It is worth noting that the Louvain algorithm is nondeterministic and dependent on the order in which the nodes are processed. That is why we have used a random seed, so that we can comment on the results without having to worry about them changing if the notebook is run again.
								<img src="assets/images/communities_sizes.png" alt="Communities Sizes" width='700' class="center-im">
								In order to have a better insight of the communities, here is the list of most relevant characters in each community number:
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 40px; font-size:75%;">

							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">

								We will now have a look at the results and see if we can conclude anything interesting about these communities. Of course, we can instantly see from the size distribution plot that community 1 is the largest community by far. Furthermore, when we look at the 10 characters with the highest degree of each community, we also se that community 1 contains most of the main characters, including Harry, Ron and Hermione. Looking at the other communities' characters with the highest degrees, we can see some interesting patterns form:
								<br>
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 40px; ">
								<b>Community 1 - </b>This community is the largest by far as can be seen in the distibution of community sizes. We can also see that this partition contains most of the main characters: Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny and Hagrid just to name a few.
								<br>
								<b>Community 2 - </b>This community is made up of former Gryffindor quiddich captains. These characers don't appear in person anywhere, but they appear on plaques in the movies.
								<br>
								<b>Community 3 - </b>This community is made up of three people who all share the same surname, Bletchley. None of them are main characters, one of them is even from the game, however, in their wiki descriptions it says that they might be related, hence why they ended in the same partition.
								<br>
								<b>Community 4 - </b>This is a fairly large community, and it consists mainly of characters from the Slytherin house.
								<br>
								<b>Community 5 - </b>This is another fairly large community, and this community consists of charcters mainly from the Harry Potter video game.
								<br>
								<b>Community 6 - </b>This community consists of just two people: "Louise", and "Louise's admirer". They both appear in the Harry Potter game: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.
								<br>
								<b>Community 7 - </b>This is another very small commnity, consisting of just three people: Two Slytherin students who blocked an area of the school together, and one character from the game.
								<br>
								<b>Community 8 - </b>This community consists of characters from the game and a few old slytherin quiddich players.
								<br>
								<b>Community 9 - </b>This is another community consisting of old students of quiddich teams who appear on plaques in the movies.
								<br>
								<b>Community 10 - </b>This community contains characters such as Headless Nick, Myrtle Warren and Helena Ravewclaw, who are all ghosts. Indeed, this is a community consisting mainly of ghosts roaming Hogwarts.
								<br>
								<b>Community 11 - </b>Characters from the game: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
								<br>
								<b>Community 12 - </b>Characters from the Fantastic Beasts movies, many of whom are part of the British Ministry of Magic.
								<br>
								<b>Community 13 - </b>This is another large community, and many of its members are professors at Hogwarts.
								<br>
								<b>Community 14 - </b>This is a small community, consisting of just three people. These people were members of the Duelling Club in the Training Grounds during the 1996–1997 school year. The members are Maynard Hatton, Fergus Cowley and Anthony Otterburn.
								<br>
								<b>Community 15 - </b>This community has just two people: James Tuckett (I) and James Tuckett (II).
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
								<br>
								For the 8 most relevant communities we have created the following <b>wordclouds</b>, which help identify and understand how the categorization has been made, and give us insights into the characters in each category.
								<br>
								<img src="assets/images/communities_WordClouds.png" alt="Communities WordClouds" class="center-im">
								<br>
								For the WordClouds based on the wiki descriptions, we decided to only take those communities who had at least 10 members, as to not get anywhere the WordClouds were only based on two or three people. This leaves us with 8 communities to calculate the WordClouds for. 
								<br>
								<br>
								We can see in the WordCloud for community 2 that this community is indeed all about quiddich, as some of the most important words are "quiddich", "appears" and "team", and the fact that "Gryffindor" and "captain" are also very important words shows that it is indeed past Gryffindor quiddich captains. 
								<br><br>
								Communities 1 and 4 have several similarities, with words such as "Voldemort", "death", "family", "battle" and "friend" appearing, with high importance, in both WordClouds. As these two communities are both large and seem to mainly consist of characters from the movies, it makes sense that a lot of the words are similar. However, as we found that community 4 had many members of the Slytherin house, one might have expected the WordCloud for community 4 to be more "evil" than community 1, but that doesn't seem to be the case. 
								<br>
								<br>
								In communities 8 and 9, we can again see that many of their members were involved with quiddich, especially from the Slytherin house, as words such as "quiddich", "slytherin" and "captain" are very large in these WordClouds. The WordCloud for community 10 also shows that this community does indeed consist of ghosts, as words such as "ghost" and "spirit" are very large, and the names of the ghosts also appear often, e.g. "headless", "nick", "helena", "ravenclaw", etc.
								<br>
								
								<br>
								<img src="assets/images/communities_sentiment.png" alt="Communities Sentiment" class="center-im">
								<br>
								Lastly, when doing the sentiment analysis of the communities, we could only perform this on the communities that contained characters who spoke in the movies, hence only communities 1, 4, 5, 10 and 13 could be analyzed. Furthermore, as the characters from communities 5 and 10 don't have many lines in the movies, not a lot can be concluded from them. However, out of the remaining communities, communities 1, 4 and 13, it can be seen that it is community 1 which has the lowest sentiment through the movies. This could be because it is often the main characters who experience suffering and grief in the movies.

								In this section, we will look at the characters' sentiments throughout the movies. We will look at the main characters' individual sentiment change throughout the movies, as well as the overall sentiment of each movie and the individual houses' sentiment change throughout the movies. We will be looking at the sentiment of each chapter, and will thus be able to get an insight into the movies.

                            	<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
                            		Here we will be analyzing the houses' sentiment throughout the movies. We will do this by combining the sentiment of each character belonging to a house. Here we will again be calculating the sentiment per chapter, using both Vader Sentiment and LabMT.								
								<br>
								<iframe width="900" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~mmestre/106.embed"></iframe>
								<br>
								Please note that, as the sentiments are calculated per chapter, there are several characters whose sentiment graphs aren't complete as they don't appear in every chapter. In order to see the full analysis and development of the code related to this part, please feel free to refer to the explainer notebook.
								<br>
								<br>
								When we look at the main character, Harry Potter, we can see that the VAder sentiment and LabMT sentiment generally tend to follow each other. Sometimes one will have a more extreme peak or dip than the other, for example, the LabMT sentiment has a much more dramatic drop than the vader sentiment at the end of movie 1, whereas it's the other way round for a scene near the start of movie 2. The sentiment of Harry Potter seems to remain fairly similar throughout all the movies for both models. 
								<br>
								<br>
								When we look at the other two main characters' sentiments compared to Harry Potter's, we can see that they follow each other quite nicely with a few exceptions, Ron for example has a large dip in the first movie where neither of the others has, and both Ron and Hermione have several drops in movie 7 and the start of 8 where Harry doesn't. Looking at some of the other characters, we see that Dumbledore's sentiment is almost always positive/above average, whereas Voldemort's is the opposite, as would be expected.
								<br>
								<br>
								We will now look at the overall sentiment change of the movies as well as the sentiment of each house. First, we notice that although the sentiment varies for each chapter, the average sentiment of each movie seems to be about the same. We notice a very large dip in sentiment at the start of movie 2. This is from the scene "Writing on the wall" where Harry hears the snake in the wall talking about killing and murdering, and Argus Filch says he wants to kill Harry when he sees his cat is dead and thinks Harry was the one who did it. This explains why the sentiment is so low for this scene. 
								<br>
								<br>
								The Gryffindor sentiment follows the overall sentiment almost perfectly, which is likely because many of the main characters are from Gryffindor, hence they make up a large part of the script. There is however a large drop in sentiment in the LabMT model towards the end of movie 1. 
								<br>
								<br>
								For the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff houses, the same problem with the characters occurs; there are a lot of chapters where they don't talk, so it is hard to conclude much from their sentiment. 
								<br>
								<br>
								For the Slytherin house, we can see that their sentiment is often lower than that of Gryffindor. At the end of movie 8 we see Slytherin has a very high sentiment quickly followed by a very low sentiment, suggesting something changes for the worse for the Slytherins at the end, which is indeed intact with the actual movie.

								This graph made with the Fandom Wiki has some underlying knowledge that can be extracted by its structure. The Louvain community algorithm helped us to understand some of the structures by clustering individuals in groups also known as communities. However, this does not help us to get information on a node level.
								<br>
								<br>
								For instance, what is the most similar/close character to Harry Potter? With the Louvain community algorithm, we can only say that Harry potter belongs to a certain community but nothing more. May we do better with it?

							<h2><u>Tool insights</u></h2>
							
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
								Prerequisite: <i>Skim gram model</i>. If you are familiar with the word2vec skip-gram model, great, if not we recommend <a href="http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/" target="_blank" style="color:DodgerBlue"><u>this great post</u></a> which explains it in great detail as from this point forward we assume you are familiar with it.
								<br>
								<br>
								The skip-gram neural network model is actually surprisingly simple in its most basic form. Train a simple neural network with a single hidden layer to perform a certain task, but then we’re not actually going to use that neural network for the task we trained it on! Instead, the goal is actually just to learn the weights of the hidden layer–we’ll see that these weights are actually the “word vectors” that we’re trying to learn.

								<br>
								<b>Node2vec</b> is an algorithm to generate vector representations of nodes on a graph. node2vec follows the intuition that random walks through a graph can be treated like sentences in a corpus. Each node in a graph is treated like an individual word, and a random walk is treated as a sentence.
								<br>
								<br>
								By feeding these "sentences" into a skip-gram, or by using the continuous bag of words model paths found by random walks can be treated as sentences, and traditional data-mining techniques for documents can be used.
								<br>
								<br>
								The algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods and argues that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations of nodes in graphs. The algorithm is an extension of Gensim's word2vec algorithm and is considered one of the best classifiers for nodes in a graph.
								<br>
								<br>
								The algorithm follows 2 steps: Generation of a chain of nodes with a sampling strategy and training of a Word2vector algorithm such as the skim-gram model.
								<br>

								High-level process:
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 40px; ">
								<b>1 - </b>From a graph, start from a node and generate a defined number of walks through the network with a certain length, which we will call "Sentence". For instance (Node 1 -> Node 5 -> Node 8 -> Node 6)
								<br>
								<b>2 - </b>Each of the sentences will be used to train a Word2vector and the output will attach for each unique node, a unique vector.
								<br>
								<b>3 - </b>This vector can be compared with another vector by using the cosine similarity
								<br>
								<b>4 - </b>The most similar vectors can be trace back to their nodes.

									These are our results and our comments on them:
									<br>
									<img src="assets/images/finding_similar.PNG" alt="Finding 1"  width=900>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
								
								<br>
								<b>Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley - </b>Together with Harry, they are forming the Trio of the saga.
								<br>
								<b>Tom Riddle - </b>Also known as Voldemort, which is the supreme enemy of Harry Potter.
								<br>
								<b>Draco Malfoy - </b>It is the rival of Harry Potter.
								<br>
								<b>Ginevra Weasley - </b>She is Harry Potter's wife.
								<br>
								<b>Dolores Umbridge and Severus Snape - </b>Two professors (Head of the Improper Use of Magic Office and Co-Leader of Duelling Club at Hogwarts) that teach Harry Potter at Hogwarts.
								<br>
								<b>Rubeus Hagrid - </b>Hagrid is Harry's friend – and soon, he's also friends with Ron and Hermione. He invites them all to tea at his house on their days off, and he tells them the secret of his baby dragon.
								<br>
								<b>Neville Longbottom - </b>They were good friends as well as classmates and room mates at Hogwarts and Neville supported Harry against Voldemort by joining Dumbledore's Army and destroying the last piece of Horcrux that made Voldemort mortal again, Nagini. Also, both James and Lily(Harry's parents) and Frank and Alice(Neville's parents) were out and out in opposition to Voldemort as well as they were notable members of The Order of the Phoenix.
								<br>
								<b>Sirius Black - </b>Sirius is Harry's godfather and sometimes treats him like a son, but at other times he seems to forget Harry isn't his best friend, James Potter
								<br>
								<b>Albus Dumbledore - </b>Dumbledore is the man from whom Harry has learned most about being a wizard and a human being. Throughout their six years together, Albus Dumbledore spends a great deal of his time teaching Harry about life in the way most parents do.
								<br>
							</p>
							<h2><b>Finding 2</b> - Who is Harry Potter's lover, according to the graph?</h2> 
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									Since all the nodes are now encoded into vectors, we can do some mathematical operations with it!
									<br>
									<br>
									For instance: <b>King-man+Woman = Queen</b>
									<br>
									<br>
									Since we only have the name of the characters, we want to play with their hearts. We know that Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger are together but we can't find the name of Harry Potter's wife... To find it, let's do:
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 40px; ">
									<b>Harry Potter + (Love) = Harry Potter's lover</b>
									<br>
									<b>Harry Potter + (Ronald Weasley - Hermione Granger) = Harry Potter's lover</b>
									<br>
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									Our results:
									<br>
									<img src="assets/images/finding_lover.PNG" alt="Finding 2"  width=900>

								<h2><b>Finding 3</b> -  Can we see understand the louvain communities with the Node to Vector algorithm?</h2>
								<br>
								<img src="assets/images/louvain_communities.png" alt="louvain_communities" >
								<br>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									At first glance, the t-SNE algorithm comes with better differentiation between the Community than the House. This confirms the modularity higher found by the Louvain Algorithm for the partition rather than the house. \
									<br>
									<br>
									On the left figure, the group composed mostly by the community 5, seems to be quite distinct from the rest of the nodes: Those consist of characters from the Harry Potter video game. Therefore, it makes sense to have this group set aside. However, if we look at the same points from the House perspective, they do not look like a homogenous group.
									<br>
									<br>
									Community 4, represented in Green on the figure on the left, is a fairly large community, and it consists mainly of characters from the Slytherin house. We can definitely agree on that by looking at the same points but with the house labels.
									<br>
									<br>
									To sum up, the Louvain algorithm proved that it can pick up communities in a better way than just looking at the house and this can be shown by plotting each of the nodes (represented by a vector created by the Node to Vector Algorithm).

								The emotion behind a character is defined by more than just positive or negative sentiment. To get complex emotions such as happiness, hate or worry, we need to train a model to recognize those sentiments on a training set and apply it to Harry Potter's movie scripts. This technique is called transfer learning.

								The plot below shows the impact of each emotion or feeling in each scene of the entire Harry Potter saga. The weight of the feelings of each scene has been calculated by considering the following emotions: happiness, love, surprise, fun, enthusiasm and relief are all rather good emotions, whereas worry, sadness and hate are bad. Finally, we have neutral, and empty groups all the rest of the emotions that they obtained from the models.

								Below we take a closer look at the analysis of the results of this fantastic tool we have developed to study the unfolding of sentiment in films. Please feel free to play around with the graph as it is highly interactive!
								<h2 style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;"><u>Happiness</u></h2>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									- When looking at the impact happiness has in the movies we can clearly see 3 spikes. The first two we see make a lot of sense since they are located towards the ending of movies 1 and 2, which are well known for having very happy endings in comparison with the rest of the saga.
									<br>
									- Another spike can be seen in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1, at the moment when Hermione and Harry discover that they can use Gryffindor sword, which was left for Harry by Dumbledore, to destroy Horcruxes.
									<br>
									- Just by looking at the plot it can be seen that happiness is in decline as the saga progresses, and in fact, it is widely acknowledged by fans that the films get darker and darker, going from a compilation of children's films to a totally adult mood.
								<h2 style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;"><u>Sadness</u></h2>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									- The most highlighted moment of sadness throughout all of the movies can be seen towards the end of the last movie, when Harry Potter dies (coming back to life afterward) and Hogwarts is partially destroyed when fighting against de dark lord Voldemort.
									<br>
									- A very relevant part considering sadness can be noted at the end of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, when Bellatrix Lestrange strikes Sirius Black with the killing curse and kills him in front of Harry. A very sad moment.
									<br>
									- It can also be seen at the beginning of the chamber of secrets a spike, related to the visit Dobby pays Harry to warn him about going to Hogwarts.
								<h2 style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;"><u>Love</u></h2>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									- As expected, we can see love highlights in the beginning and ending of the first and second movies, and at the end of the saga when Harry kills Voldemort, Hogwarts is saved and there is a fast-forward where we can see Harry and Giny Weasley married and with a son.
									<br>
									- Highest spikes in love are shown in movies 4 and 7. When looking into the Goblet of Fire, those scenes are related to the Quidditch world cup, where there is a lot of fun and party and all the Weasleys, Hermione and Harry are together. In the Deathly Hallows part 1, at the beginning of the movie, the Dursleys leave Privet Drive and leave Harry, and Hermione uses "obliviate" on her parents to erase their memories to make them think they did not have a daughter. Both are very loving emotive moments.
								<h2 style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;"><u>Hate</u></h2>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									- In regards to hate, there is a very remarkable scene in the Chamber of Secrets. Harry wanders through the corridors of Hogwarts following the sounds and whispers of the Basilisc. Then he encounters MrNorris, Argus Filch's cat, petrified and hung on a lamp next to a message written on a wall. Filch is absolutely furious about this and thinks Harry did that to his cat. Also, Hermione claims that the message on the wall is written in blood. There is a lot of hate in this scene overall, mainly driven by Argus Filch's thoughts towards harry for killing his cat. Amazing insight!
								<h2 style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;"><u>Fun</u></h2>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									- According to the results, the most fun scene happens in the end of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Harry and Hermione save Sirius Black and Buckbeak, and afterward go back to the hospital wing to visit Ron. He is already awake and asks how he and Hermione got outside the wing when they were right in front of him (time traveling).
								<h2 style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;"><u>Worry</u></h2>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									- This emotion is quite stable or monotonous throughout the films. It can be said that due to the very nature of the style of the films, the plot and the events, a very " worrying " result was to be expected in general. In addition, when compared to other feelings such as happiness or sadness, the weight or percentage impact on the overall feeling of each scene is much higher on average for worry.
								<h2 style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;"><u>Relief</u></h2>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									- At the beginning of the Chamber of Secrets, Harry goes to Diagon Alley using the Floo Powder mixup but he mispronounces "Diagon Alley" as "diagonally" out of a panic thanks to watching the effect of the Floo Powder as a demonstration. He then appears in a rather "dark" part of the Diagon Alley, but then he finds his way back and the overall relief feeling makes sense!
									<br>
									- Towards the end of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry and Hermione save Sirius Black and Buckbeak after traveling back in time. The final part is quite a relief as their efforts to save the situation are fulfilled.
								<h2 style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;"><u>Neutral</u></h2>
								<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
									- Although it is very exciting to talk about powerful feelings like happiness, sadness, hate... Harry Potter is characterized by one feeling above all others, the neutral one. As boring as that may sound, most of the sentences are characterized by that feeling as they are neither extremely happy nor sad. Moreover, since it is all dialogue, most of the words used are neutral in character. Therefore, it makes perfect sense to have obtained these results in the plot.
									<br>
									- However, it is worth noting that the feelings of worry and neutrality both have a similar impact in each scene. This helps determine the general nature of the Harry Potter saga.
